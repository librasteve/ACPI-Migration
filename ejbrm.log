Title:
A Critique of Using Grounded Theory as a Research Method
Pages:
pp1&#8209;10
Authors:
George Allan
Abstract:
Grounded Theory is a powerful research method for collecting and analysing research data. It was 'discovered' by Glaser & Strauss (1967) in the 1960s but is still not widely used or understood by researchers in some industries or PhD students in some science disciplines. This paper demonstrates the steps in the method and describes the difficulties encountered in applying Grounded Theory (GT). A fundamental part of the analysis method in GT is the derivation of codes, concepts and categories. Codes and coding are explained and illustrated in Section 3. Merging the codes to discover emerging concepts is a central part of the GT method and is shown in Section 4. Glaser and Strauss's constant comparison step is applied and illustrated so that the emerging categories can be seen coming from the concepts and leading to the emergent theory grounded in the data in Section 5. However, the initial applications of the GT method did have difficulties. Problems encountered when using the method are described to inform the reader of the realities of the approach. The data used in the illustrative analysis comes from recent ISIT Case Study research into configuration management (CM) and the use of commercially available computer products (COTS). Why and how the GT approach was appropriate is explained in Section 6. However, the focus is on reporting GT as a research method rather than the results of the Case Study.

Abstract:
This paper addresses 'gender disparity' in organisation. Using a multinational organisation, as a basis for data elicitation, the empirical analysis explores its human resource utilisation, on basis of gender, to assess parity of treatment. The research employs a combination of qualitative and quantitative data elicitation techniques. All comparative tables are chisquared, with probability taken at 'p

Getting results from online surveys — Reflections on a personal journey
Pages:
pp45&#8209;52
Authors:
Rachel A. McCalla
Abstract:
In this paper we present a personal reflection on the implementation of an online survey, highlighting the tradeoffs between the potential benefits and pitfalls. It is argued that casting your net out too wide, in a bid to maximise responses can result ultimately in a low response rate. We evaluate the experience of completing an online survey from the perspective of both the researcher and the respondent to outline the dynamics of the completion and submission process. Finally, in a bid to assist those interested, a review of some of the online survey tools is presented.

Knowledge management: A critical investigation
Pages:
pp53&#8209;60
Authors:
Stephen K. Probert
Abstract:
The topic of knowledge management will be analysed from a critical perspective; as will the topic of knowledge creation (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995). To begin with, the key motivations behind the discourse of knowledge creation and management are briefly discussed. The contemporary distinction between tacit and explicit knowledge is then explored. Following this, the work of Lyotard on knowledge in a (post)modern economy will be summarised. The paper then explores how some work by Foucault may provide a new direction for developing critical research strategies in this area.

Discourse analysis and complex adaptive systems: Managing variables with attitudes

Authors:

Roy Williams
Abstract:
There have been long&#8209;standing debates about the relative values of quantitative vs. qualitative research, and of positivism vs. critical theory in management studies. In this paper we discuss the value of discourse theory and the tools of discourse analysis in the context of complex adaptive systems theory, which can usefully be seen as a synthesis of the thesis of modernism and the antithesis of post&#8209;modernism. Discourse' has been developed and used in several disciplines, to interesting effect. It is now time to systematise the notion of discourse, and the tools of discourse analysis, both theoretically and practically, so that they can better be applied to management research, and to management practice.

Telehealth in the UK: A critical perspective
Pages:

Authors:
Ela Klecun-Dabrowska
Abstract:
This paper reports on the multi&#8209;layered research into telehealth in the UK conducted through a critical theory perspective. Telehealth is an umbrella term for health services delivered at a distance and, more specifically, over various telecommunication networks. The paper aims to offer an alternative perspective on telehealth, focusing on rationalities, knowledge claims and ways of legitimising telehealth. The paper concludes that there are competing and difficult to reconcile rationalities influencing telehealth, conflicting knowledge claims and no commonly agreed ways of legitimising telehealth.

Conceptualising Participatory Action Research — Three Different Practices

Authors:

Göran Goldkuhl
Abstract:
The aim of this paper is to elaborate on the concept of action research. With inspiration from work performed by Checkland and McKay & Marshall the conceptualisation we are suggesting is illustrated in a model consisting of three different practices. Action research means that  a research practice and a business practice are interacting. This interaction constitutes a third practice, which is at the same time a business change practice and an intervening empirical research practice. In the paper, we show how the three practices are interlinked to each other. The analysis is based on a work practice theory (ToP).

Abstract:
Our paper is designed to stimulate discussion of the undergraduate research process. We use recent changes in the dissertation process at Coventry Business School as a backdrop for exploring the authors perceptions of two extreme types of teaching: the subject&#8209;centred and the student&#8209;centred. We conclude that the subject&#8209;centred approach is dominant and it would seem to leave little room for continuing professional development of academics or students. Both authors will offer examples from their own reflective practice.

Abstract:
Business students like to think that their research is of practical value but rarely have the confidence to question the validity of the data they have collected. Teachers expect that students will demonstrate a critical awareness of the limits of their own and others' research. The paper outlines different ways of teaching students how to recognise the key issues surrounding validity and reliability and how to make generalizations from their research.

Abstract:
The development of easy&#8209;to&#8209;use Internet tools for synchronous communications has made a new research method possible: online focus groups. Attempts to apply them to questions formerly addressed by face&#8209;to&#8209;face focus groups have resulted not only in promising avenues for research, but also in substantive criticism. We have chosen to adopt online focus groups as a research methodology for a qualitative study of user beliefs and attitudes concerning peer&#8209;to&#8209;peer filesharing systems. This project is still in its early stages, so herein we describe not confirmatory findings of rigorous research, but the issues raised by our exploratory study, and indications of important issues to address in the use of online focus groups. This paper also demonstrates a novel analysis method which visually maps one of the unique characteristics of such groups, multi&#8209;threaded simultaneous conversations, and uses such maps to identify some notable tendencies and behaviors. We also identify some typical participant strategies we have observed, describe some skills and techniques for use in moderating such sessions, identify some powerful advantages provided by the instant and automatic transcript generation capabilities of chat session software, and characterize some important research questions to be addressed in future research.

Grounded Theory and the 'And' in Entrepreneurship Research
Pages:
pp85&#8209;94
Authors:
David Douglas
Abstract:
The paper puts forward the researching of entrepreneurship through the application of grounded theory methodology. Like much business and management research it contends that entrepreneurship research should both embrace the complex processes of enterprise activity and the inherent contextual factors that effect entrepreneurial behaviour. Accounts from other fields of social inquiry have conveyed the worthiness of grounded theory in phenomenological studies. The paper considers grounded theory methodology against the canons of accomplishing worthy social (scientific) inquiry. It addresses grounded theory as a means of emphasising how socially constructed experience is created and given meaning. It concludes that the requisite properties of grounded theory whilst addressing the principles of substantive social inquiry, as in entrepreneurship research, with some contextual and methodological considerations, offers an inductive approach to revealing complex characteristics of enterprise management, and potentially other business areas of inquiry.

Authors:
Walter Fernandez
Abstract:
Based on a recently completed major study of an emerging business practice in the area of information systems management, this paper explains and discusses several important aspects of using the "Glaserian" approach to grounded theory. Grounded theory is an effective approach to produce rigorous research that is simultaneously relevant to business and management theory development and to professional practice. The paper presents a research model and delineates a number of characteristics, risks and demands intrinsic to the method, which can help researchers contemplating the use of grounded theory methodology for their studies.

Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to discuss some of the quandaries or difficult choices that affect detailed research design as well as the 'big' orientations or paradigms that motivate studies in the field of business and management research. Many of these choices and decisions are now commonly assumed to be mere preferences, no longer worthy of debate. As in the case of whether to collect data that is say, more easily quantified than qualified. Or whether the demands of practice are incommensurable with those of the social sciences. Such oppositions and tensions are discussed here in the context of recent surveys of managerial work.

A Researcher's Dilemma &#8209; Philosophical and Methodological Pluralism
Pages:
pp145&#8209;154
Authors:
Karl Knox
Abstract:
In many research textbooks the distinction between qualitative and quantitative research is inadvertently linked with philosophical perspectives. This in essence creates a mutually exclusive relationship between method and philosophy. Initially researchers are led to believe, from these textbooks, that research is neatly divided into mutually exclusive categories, these being quantitative and qualitative research and 'never the twain shall meet'. This divide is further strengthened with the inference that the relationship extends further; associating deduction with quantitative methods and similarly induction with qualitative methods. "What happens in most texts is that qualitative research methods and quantitative research methods are set against each other as polar opposites. (Crotty 1998, p19)". This paper argues that methodological pluralism is acceptable but what is not acceptable is philosophical pluralism. By naively linking methods and approaches to specific philosophy researchers and students may miss out on potentially innovative or creative data collection methods. Alternatively and more importantly by feeling tied or constrained by their philosophical stance to particular methods and approaches, associated with them by textbooks, they may in fact reduce the credibility, validity, and or significance of the research. There maybe an elective affinity between certain philosophies and methods but this should not necessarily constrain the methods chosen.

Abstract:
The future of academic information systems will be shaped by doctoral students. Doctoral students need, therefore, to recognize that they — not their supervisors or colleagues — are in charge of their study, (Grover, 2001). The goal of this paper is to offer guidance to students on entering, surviving and flourishing during post&#8209;graduate study and beyond. I teach in the Information Systems and Technology department at the University of KwaZulu&#8209;Natal, and so much of the advice is addressed to this group, but others might find it useful. It is also rather South African&#8209;specific, but students elsewhere may find a useful idea or two.

Abstract:
The objective of this speculative paper is to open a debate as to the importance of historiography in the field of business and management studies and to this end the paper argues that it is an under utilised research paradigm.  It is the paper's contention that history has a special role to play in academic research. It contextualises the issues being studied and it gives shape to the parameters of the understanding which is offered by the research. Without access to a history of the issues and the ideas being examined it is difficult to make sense of the current situation. Being able to have a broad perspective of the history and the current situation opens the way to being able to make a valuable contribution to the theoretical body of knowledge in the field. Business and management studies can obtain much from historiography and this paper indicates.how it may be used in this context and its affinity with other accepted narrative based research paradigms already in use in this field.

Authors:
Maurice Atkinson
Abstract:
This paper describes the outcomes of the "Action Planning" stage of an action research project utilising a search conference for the purposes of organisational development. The aim of the project was the design of a methodology to facilitate the evaluation of the complexities of working in partnership and to assess the extent to which collaboration actually adds value in terms of both process and outcomes. The research centred on multi&#8209;agency partnership working within Children's Services Planning (CSP) in the Southern Health and Social Services Board's area in Northern Ireland. The resulting evaluation framework contains seven interconnected dimensions with associated sub&#8209; dimensions and assessment criteria. The framework is underpinned by the concept of a virtuous circle formed by evaluation, learning, improvement, measurement, and back to evaluation.

Through a Glass Darkly: Fact and Filtration in the Interpretation of Evidence

Authors:
Frank Bannister
Abstract:
For almost three decades, the primary fault line in information systems research has been between positivist and interpretivist research philosophies. The kernel of the debate between these two approaches rotates around the meaning of reality, two aspects of which are what constitutes a fact and what constitutes evidence. In this paper the nature of fact in interpretivist research is explored. The range of filters through which research must travel is catalogued and it is argued that a taxonomy of fact emerges from interpretivist research.

Abstract:
This paper addresses the need for re&#8209;examining the cognitive perspective on the role of language in social research. From the autopoietic perspective, language is not a tool to reveal an objective world; rather language is a venue for action, coupling the cognitive domains of two or more agents. Responsible research enquiry would seek to create systemic communication practices that allow the co&#8209;existence of differing understandings within. Creating a dialogue for exploring and emerging meaning is essential in developing understanding and validating the research results.

The Nexus Between Teaching and Research: A Qualitative Study Using two Focus Group on Academic Information Systems Teachers
Pages:
pp37&#8209;56
Authors:
Kevin Grant
Stuart Fitzgerald
Abstract:
Over the last two decades or so, the discussion of and research into the question of a nexus between teaching and research, has expanded exponentially. Much has been learnt, and said; with a growing rhetoric, with only general insights emerging and being supported by particular empirical evidence. The study of a nexus between teaching and research is not a single coherent field; rather it is beset by epistemological, methodological, political and practical differences. To date, much of the discussion and research on the nexus has arisen due to varying views and alleged agreed consensus as to the nature of the academic profession; the role of the academyuniversity and thus, how the concepts of teaching and research (including scholarship) have been conceptualised and enacted to inform teaching practice.  There is a continuing debate as to whether research undertaken by academic staff within the boundaries of a university adds value to the teaching and student learning. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the usefulness of focus groups as a way of exploring and making sense of the conceptions staff have with regard to the nexus between teaching and research. Two focus groups were held with a sample of IS academic teachers. The merits and limitations of using a focus group are discussed given this area of investigation with some possible research areas highlighted. The paper argues that focus groups for this type of study are not appropriate on their own and should be considered as part of a much wider and multi methods research design when attempting to make sense of a complex, multifaceted and emotional areas of teaching, research, scholarship, administration, management and knowledge transfer; and the identify of IS in Higher Education.

Grounded Theory: Its Diversification and Application Through two Examples From Research Studies on Knowledge and Value Management

Abstract:
The grounded theory research method has been adopted by researchers across a range of different disciplines. Two different examples that are currently using the method as part of individual research programmes are explained. These two examples form part of two separate PhD programmes that are currently at similar stages of development making for a timely comparison of the different applications of the grounded theory research method. Both examples involve research conducted in the construction related fields of knowledge management (km) and value management (vm). A background is provided for each study and the similarities and differences between each application are outlined as well as the process and stages involved in the research investigations undertaken. The use of computer software packages is explored and a case for and against using such a tool is made to the effect that this will largely depend on the nature of the problem under investigation. The paper concludes with the suggestion that grounded theory is a method that can be adapted to suit the nature of the research problem provided that the fundamental aspect is adhered to which is to ensure that the theory derived is 'grounded' in the data.

Abstract:
With the Internet now being a part of everyday life mixed&#8209;mode surveys that use the world wide web can be seen as an opportunity to increase the response rate of surveys. This paper looks at the advantages and disadvantages of different response modes suitable for mixed&#8209;mode surveys. Based on this consideration the paper addresses the influence of a mixed&#8209;mode approach using conventional mail and web based questionnaires on coverage, sampling, measurement, and non&#8209; response error as well as pitfalls and opportunities specific to this type of survey. It discusses mixed&#8209; mode and web specific issues such as technological aspects, security, convenience and similarity. The paper proposes that this approach has no apparent potential error consequences if certain requirements are fulfilled. The use of mixed mode questionnaires is exemplified by a survey conducted with 1000 SMEs in the North West of England in 2002. After analysing the findings the paper concludes by looking at the relation between the mode of response and the answers provided by the respondents and by summarising the insights gained from the study.

Title:
Grounded in Practice: Using Interpretive Research to Build Theory
Pages:
pp81&#8209;92
Authors:
Bruce H. Rowlands
Abstract:
This paper provides guidance for carrying out research using an interpretive framework to build theory of IS practice. The purpose of the paper is to provide an example of (a) factors influencing the choice of interpretive methods, (b) developing a theoretical framework, (c) particulars of data collection and analysis, and (d) an application of evaluative criteria applicable to interpretive research. This paper is different in that the focus is on describing the research process, conceptual issues and the research methods used rather than the findings. This format is important given that there is no accepted general model for communicating interpretive research, and few guidelines exist for conducting the inductive process central to interpretive research.

Title:
Developing Information Systems Design Knowledge: A Critical Realist Perspective
Pages:
pp93&#8209;102
Authors:
Sven A. Carlsson
Abstract:
Academic Information Systems (IS) research has a serious utilization and relevance problem. To increase IS research utilization and relevance, scholars argue that the mainstream IS research, which is based on the behavioral science paradigm, should be complemented with research based on the design science paradigm. The current IS design science frameworks have a strong focus on the IT artefact, in most cases an exclusive focus on the IT artefact. The frameworks have very little discussion and clarifications regarding underpinning philosophies, but most seem to be based on positivism, traditional realism, or pragmatism. This paper presents an alternative framework for IS design science research. The framework builds on that the aim of IS design science research is to develop practical knowledge for the design and realization of different classes of IS initiatives, where IS are viewed as socio&#8209;technical systems and not just IT artefacts. The underpinning philosophy of the framework is critical realism which has been developed as an alternative to positivism and traditional realism as well as to constructivism (relativism). The framework proposes that the output of IS design science research is practical IS design knowledge in the form of field&#8209;tested and grounded technological rules. The IS design knowledge is developed through an IS design science research cycle. The paper presents how technological rules can be developed as well as the nature of such rules.

Authors:

Milena Bobeva
Abstract:
This paper presents the case of a non&#8209;traditional use of the Delphi method for theory evaluation. On the basis of experience gained through secondary and primary research, a generic decision toolkit for Delphi studies is proposed, comprising of taxonomy of Delphi design choices, a stage model and critical methodological decisions. These research tools will help to increase confidence when adopting the Delphi alternative and allow for a wider and more comprehensive recognition of the method within both scientific and interpretivist studies.

Abstract:
Learning logs are an increasingly popular mode assessment. They record learning, experience and reflection. This paper considers learning logs as a research method, where researchers wish to gain a deep understanding of the processes of learning, reflection and experience as they occur in individuals over a period of time. Techniques are offered for implementing logs as a research method, analysing the data and interpreting results.

Interpretivism and the Pursuit of Research Legitimisation: An Integrated Approach to Single Case Design
Pages:
pp123&#8209;132
Authors:
Felicity Kelliher
Abstract:
While interpretive research is recognised for its value in providing contextual depth, results are often criticised in terms of validity, reliability and generalizability, referred to collectively as research legitimisation. This paper explores the criticisms levied on interpretive case studies and presents a research design that seeks to address these criticisms. The paper describes the research template developed by the author and applies it to a longitudinal case study carried out on a micro firm in the Republic of Ireland. Following some detailed evaluation and analysis the author concludes that legitimisation of an interpretative case study is improved when an integrative approach involving the combination of specific research techniques to relevant and appropriate standards is adopted.

Tell me a Story —A way to Knowledge
Pages:

Authors:
Dan Remenyi
Abstract:
A narrative or a story (and these terms are synonyms) is a fundamental way of understanding our environment and relationships in it and thus it is a key feature of sound research whatever methodological approach has been taken. The skills of story telling are important in both qualitative or interpretive and quantitative research. But it comes into its own in qualitative research where story telling especially as it appears in case studies and action research is of prime importance. In quantitative research a story or narrative is also required to contextualize the work. The argument developed in this paper balances the idea that numerical analysis underpins the most powerful research paradigms.

Abstract:
To collect real&#8209;time data as opposed to retrospective data requires new methodological traits. One possibility is the use of behavioral simulations that synthesize the self&#8209;administered questionnaire, experimental designs, role&#8209;playing and scenarios. Supported by Web technology this new data collection methodology proves itself valid and with high appeal to respondents.

Can Methodological Applications Develop Critical Thinking?
Pages:

Authors:
Deborah Blackman
Angela Benson
Abstract:
This paper outlines how using research methods to develop critical thinking was explored in a workshop and then developed into a curriculum. An exercise showed how diverse methodologies led to different answers, which were explored to consider the nature of knowledge itself and the subsequent implications. The paper concludes that such an approach can (a) develop critical thinking skills at a level of deep, rather than surface learning and (b) effectively challenge some preconceived ideas held by students about how knowledge is developed and shared. The crucial element of success was the design and implementation of the assessment.

Authors:

Abstract:
Since the most problematic areas in applying NUD*IST and NVivo in management research are in using them for recording, collating, analysing and reporting interview data, this paper concentrates on the use of NUD*IST and NVivo for these purposes. It examines the problems that arise in their use at the different stages (Interviewing, Transcription, Structuring and Reporting) of three types of research project: a major research project, a specialist research project and a doctoral research project. Suggestions are made as to how these problems can be mitigated. Conclusions are drawn about good practice in the use of NUD*IST and NVivo and suggestions are made on some enhancements that might be made to them. Comments are made about Interpretivism and the use of NUD*IST and NVivo and on the role of supervisors in doctoral research involving the use of NUD*IST and NVivo.

Applying Multidimensional Item Response Theory Analysis to a Measure of Meta&#8209;Perspective Performance
Pages:
pp23&#8209;30
Authors:
K. Michele Kacmar
William L. Farmer
Suzanne Zivnuska
L. A. Witt
Abstract:
The authors introduce a scale to measure meta&#8209;perspectives, my view of your view of me, about one's performance in an organizational setting. Applied to the performance appraisal process, this perspective allows the authors to investigate how employees think their supervisors view their performance. Meta&#8209;perspectives thereby enrich our understanding of the relationship effects inherent in the performance appraisal process. Due to the desirable properties of item response theory (non&#8209;sample specific item parameter estimates), a multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) model was applied to the data. This allowed for the simultaneous estimation of dimensionality and item threshold values. Data collected from 1,255 full&#8209;time workers in two different organizations reveal that the items did not lie along a unidimensional continuum, but that three dimensions underlie the proposed scale: employee perceptions of the supervisor's view of employee work ethic, work product, and self&#8209;regulation. The authors offer suggestions for refinement of the scale and future research.

Proposals for Designing and Controlling a Doctoral Research Project in Management Sciences
Pages:

Authors:
Jacques Lauriol
Abstract:
Analysis of available literature on the design and control of a doctoral research project has led to the updating of a certain number of "constants" concerning the difficulties PhD students encounter during this process. These "constants" revolve around the crucial yet arduous issue of what comprises a "good thesis". The present article offers a response to this question. It begins by highlighting the characteristics of the institutional context in which a doctoral study is carried out before offering three topics for thought (definition of the research project, deployment and evaluation of results). It concludes by focusing on the tension underlying all scientific research between "dissidence" (i.e., the ability to question "normal science") and "conformity" (the study's fit in an institutional context).

Validation of Simulation Based Models: A Theoretical Outlook
Pages:
pp39&#8209;46
Authors:
Morvin Savio Martis
Abstract:
Validation is the most incomprehensible part of developing a model. Nevetheless, no model can be accepted unless it has passed the tests of validation, since the procedure of validation is vital to ascertain the credibility of the model. Validation procedures are usually framework based and dynamic, but a methodical procedure can be followed by a modeller (researcher) in order to authenticate the model. The paper starts with a discussion on the views and burning issues by various researchers on model validation and the foundational terminology involved. The paper later highlights on the methodology and the process of validation adopted. Reasons for the failure of the model have also been explored. The paper finally focuses on the widely approved validation schemes (both quantitative and qualitative) and techniques in practice, since no one test can determine the credibility and validity of a simulation model. Moreover, as the model passes more tests (both quantitative and qualitative) the confidence in the model increases correspondingly.

Abstract:
This paper investigates the factors that motivate Australian consumers to use the Internet to search and shop for products and services. A qualitative research method was used, utilizing a semi&#8209;structured, in&#8209;depth interview technique. Twenty in&#8209;depth interviews were conducted, using a snowball sampling method. The study found that there were six motivating factors that drew consumers to search and shop online for products and services. These factors include: convenience, saving time, cheaper prices along with the ability to compare prices, good place to shop for specialty and hard&#8209;to&#8209;access products, higher level of consumer control, and the ease of comparing products and services.

A Case Study on the Selection and Evaluation of Software for an Internet Organisation

Abstract:
The authors conducted research to determine whether IT&#8209;managers, IT auditors, users, management, etc. (all decision&#8209;makers) use a certain evaluation and selection process to acquire software to meet business objectives and the requirement of users. An argument was used that the more thorough the software evaluation and selection process, the more likely it would be that the organisation will choose software that meets these targets. The main objective of the research was therefore to determine whether Media24 uses evaluation methods and obtain the desired results. Media24 is Africa's biggest publishing group and offers entertainment, information and education 24 hours a day and served as a good example of an Internet Service organisation that made their employees available for this research project. The results confirmed that Media24 uses suggested protocol as noted in the theory for software acquisition correctly during most stages.

Title:
Is Research that is Both Causally Adequate and Adequate on the Level of Meaning Possible or Necessary in Business Research? A Critical Analysis of some Methodological Alternatives
Pages:
pp1&#8209;10
Authors:
D.A.L. Coldwell
Abstract:
There has been a recent resurgence of interest in both statistical methods aimed at generating causally adequate explanations in business research and criticisms of these. Running parallel with this discussion has been critical discussion on the adequacy of such explanations at the level of meaning and specific attempts to address this issue with techniques such as those used in grounded theory. All too often the two methodological approaches have remained separated from each other&#8209; as a qualitative and a quantitative mainstream in business research. This is partly because of the different skills of the researchers involved andor their different attitudes regarding the validity of the methods used. The Weberian methodological paradigm of explanation that is both causally adequate and adequate at the level of meaning has to some extent been lost sight of since Denzin's triangulated model was put forward as a possible solution in the 70's. However, the issue remains: is causally adequate explanation possible with statistical &#8209;type analyses and are idiographic techniques such as grounded theory able to capture explanations that are valid at the level of meaning? The paper critiques some older and more recent methods aimed at implementing statistical analyses in generating causally adequate explanation and qualitative techniques aimed at providing explanations that are adequate at the level of meaning. The paper reviews an empirical study aimed at providing such a complete explanation and questions, building on the perspectives of evidence&#8209;based management and critical realism, whether such fully adequate explanations are practically possible or, indeed, fundamentally necessary in generating knowledge that is practically useful for solving specific managerial problems.

Authors:
Javed Iqbal
Abstract:
Students have to present a formal research proposal at the time of admission or at the end of their first year study in the case of a doctorate. Many of them feel uncomfortable in preparing such proposals due to lack of experience or knowledge. This paper describes the way a research proposal may be prepared for doctoral projects in social sciences. The paper provides a road map to write a suitable proposal acceptable to their supervisors or examination committee. The proposal is based on a case study undertaken by the author and addresses key issues in preparing a postgraduate proposal including researcher's professional background, selection of topic, research question, research objectives, and importance of the study, scope, methodology, conceptual framework and potential outcome. These themes have been grouped under four parts: the context, the content, the process and the product.

Authors:
Margaret Lindorff
Abstract:
In recent years, relatively little business or organisational research has focused on personal welfare detached from economic or organisational performance. Similarly, the mainstream management literature has tended to overlook the social effects of undertaking academic research, in particular those that relate to the researchers' ethical obligations to participants. This paper discusses some of the ethical issues associated with research on business and in organisations, using as its framework the ethical principles of justice, beneficence, and respect for persons.

Strategies for Teaching Research Ethics in Business, Management and Organisational Studies
Pages:
pp29&#8209;36
Authors:
Linda Naimi
Abstract:
Ethics education has become increasingly important in the wake of recent corporate scandals and reported scientific misconduct. The pressure to succeed has spurred the emergence of a 'cheating culture' (Callahan, 2004). Callahan suggests that ethics — i.e., integrity, honesty and fairness — is losing ground to a market&#8209;driven economy and culture that rewards self&#8209;interest, self&#8209;gratification, and amoral behaviour. As educators, we are committed to providing students with the preparation, mentoring and guidance they need to address ethical issues that arise in their academic, professional and personal lives. We need to serve as positive role models to encourage ethical conduct. Nowhere is this more critical than in the area of research, particularly human subject research. To ensure integrity in research, students and faculty must demonstrate that they understand the ethical and legal ramifications of their work prior to initiating any research. In addition to legal requirements, universities now use a variety of creative approaches designed to promote integrity in personal and professional conduct. This paper discusses effective strategies for teaching research ethics to undergraduate and graduate students in business, management and organisational studies. Strategies include online interactive training modules, case studies, role&#8209;playing, action research, critical inquiry, simulations, the Socratic Method, interest triggers, and research analysis. This paper also includes a brief look at LANGURE, an NSF funded national initiative involving over one hundred faculty and students at eight land grant and historically black universities in the United States. LANGURE is developing a model curriculum in research ethics for doctoral candidates in the physical, social and life sciences, and engineering.

How Hospitality Industry Managers' Characteristics Could Influence Hospitality Management Curricula

Authors:
Sjoerd A. Gehrels
Abstract:
This doctorate research (EdD): work in progress describes the value systems and other driving powers of hotel upper segment restaurant managers (HUSRM's) and the way that these can influence hospitality management curriculum design. The transcripts of the digitally recorded semi&#8209;structured interviews were analysed applying grounded theory methodology (Glaser and Strauss) and using NVivo7 QSR software in order to conceptualize on the answers provided by the respondents. The research generated some elements in the ongoing construction of theory about the characteristics of this specific category of professionals and the application in education. By using grounded theory methodology, theory is constructed from the empirical data. The outcomes of the research provided an overview of the divers value systems and driving powers of the respondents. Recommendations were made to have these value systems, driving powers and other characteristics to be taken into account by hospitality management schools in the curricula content and proximaty to the industry. A moderate alert was issued in relation to schools' size and format as perceived by the respondents. The research is going to be moved into a next phase that involves expanding the interview sample.

Research Dilemmas in Management and Business Studies
Pages:
pp49&#8209;60
Authors:
John Mendy
Abstract:
This paper examines some of the philosophical and practical dilemmas that are faced by researchers in management and business studies — in the context of the epistemological and ontological assumptions introduced. The relevant methodological frameworks to be used stem from Strauss and Quinn (1997). The importance of employee language and organisational discourses are presented from the empirical data on "Aspects of Organisational Culture and Change" in Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire to demonstrate the epistemological and ontological dilemmas faced by researchers in organisational analysis. Symbolic interactionism and stories are also used to highlight the importance of speech actors within an organisational change context in order to surface some of these dilemmas in business studies in general and management research in particular. These two provide alternative positions to Strauss and Quinn's "maintained" analysis of how organisations and managers implement change interventions and employees' reactions to these. Amongst some of my principal objectives is to demonstrate what can be contributed when researchers focus on what can be considered credible and valid knowledge that can be generalised in organisational and management studies.

Development of Variant Definitions for Stakeholder Groups with Regard to the Performance of Public Transit in the United States
Pages:
pp61&#8209;70
Authors:
Jason Keith Phillips
Diane M. Phillips
Abstract:
In the United States, the performance of public transit systems is often characterized, in both the popular press and academic literature, as being mediocre at best and growing steadily worse. Drawing on insights from the extant literature and a census of all U.S. transit systems, this research argues that "multiple definitions" of transit performance exist and are composed of three macro&#8209;constructs which are weighted differently by different stakeholder groups and thereby provide unique definitions for each stakeholder group. Statistical analysis of the data suggests that there are differences in both the absolute importance and relative importance placed on the three macro&#8209;constructs by U.S. transit stakeholder groups. Therefore, the examination of public transit performance from a multiple stakeholder points&#8209;of&#8209;view perspective appears warranted in order to better evaluate the performance of public transit systems.

Abstract:
This paper shows the application of Grounded Theory (GT) method, particularly the Straussian approach to GT, in a research project that studies the role of managers during and after the implementation of an inter&#8209;organizational information system (IOIS). We present the steps followed —sampling, data collection, analysis, and literature comparison— paying special attention to the intricacies that arose during the research process, and we reflect on the lessons learned from using GT in an interpretive case study. The paper shows: first, the application of the coding paradigm proposed by Strauss and Corbin to analyse process data; second, how action diagrams can help structure and report on process data; and, third, the importance of flexibility, creativity, and keeping an open mind when using GT analytical tools, given that various avenues may be apparent before a plausible theory starts to emerge. We consider the paper illustrates some experiences that may inform others in their GT research process.

Title:
Managing the Fear Factor (or how a Mini&#8209;Viva Assessment can Improve the Process of Learning for International Students)
Pages:

Authors:
Susan Sayce
Abstract:
This paper is about an exploration of international business students' learning through the use of mini&#8209;vivas as a form of assessment. It also includes an investigation of the meaning of a mini&#8209;viva for students who come from a wide range of nationalities. Pedagogical research has indicated that using this form of summative assessment for large cohorts of international students may be problematic (Carless 2002). However, experimentation with this model of assessment with MA business students in research methods has indicated that mini&#8209;vivas can enhance and consolidate the learning potential of international students. So in effect this paper is also about explaining why this has happened in relation to students' learning.

The Catalog Usability Questionnaire — Adoption and Validation of a Usability Scale for Print&#8209;Catalogs

Authors:

Abstract:
The usability of interfaces is mainly tested via standardized&#8209;questionnaires or via less standardized processoriented verbal protocols. Standardized questionnaires have got the advantage of generating reasonable indices with quite low effort. In contrast, process oriented verbal protocols offer the opportunity of gaining more thorough insights into the interaction and the problems that might come up. While efficient standardized methods for the measurement of online media with their non&#8209;linear structure already exist, there are no such methods to measure the usability of linear structured offline media. However, it can be assumed that usability of offline print media plays an important role for a brand's image and the buying behavior of customers. The objective of our study was to adapt a scale to measure usability of online shops to print catalogs in order to measure their usability. A field study (n = 60) and a laboratory experiment (n = 92) have been made to test the reliability and validity of the adapted scale. Participants were asked to evaluate the catalogs of two travel companies by using the adapted questionnaire. Concerning the reliability, in both studies the scale showed good internal consistency. The values of Cronbach's alpha were comparable to results in studies using the original scale with online shops. Concerning the validity, results show correlations between usability and buyer's intention as well as recommendation. Furthermore, the usability scores of both catalogs differed as experts (n = 20) expected. Moreover, the questionnaire was validated using the results of verbal protocols that were collected simultaneously in the laboratory study. In example, the correlation between usability scores and problems that came up during the interaction was proven. Overall, the results support the usefulness of the adapted scale to measure the usability of print&#8209;catalogs. Implications for research and management will be discussed.

Authors:
Ana C. Vasconcelos
Abstract:
This paper exemplifies the combined use of Grounded Theory and of the ArenasSocial Worlds Theory in a study of the discursive interaction amongst middle managers at a UK University administration and academic computing services. This study aimed at exploring the role of discursive interaction and negotiation in the organisational adaptation of information systems, by defining the premises upon which discourses were constructed and deployed on the basis of particular worldviews and how in turn they informed back different worldviews. It presents key lessons learned from this approach in relationship to the roles of codification, of relationships bewtween conceptual categories and between between theoretical influences and empirical work, as well as those emerging from the lived experience of research analysts.

Abstract:
Security is still too orientated towards technology and behavioural aspects are under prioritized. Organisations focus on the ability of technology to minimise risks. This paper as a preliminary research of a PhD thesis will argue that this assumption and approach is misguided, so we will focus on how a critical approach is more useful to exposing these issues. The key to secure systems is employees' perception and the action they take in accordance with the learned and perceived need for an understanding of compliance. The paper is about critical approaches to research and it just happens to be information and communication technology (ICT) that is the subject area.

Title:
Hypermodernist Travellers in a Postmodern World
Pages:
pp1&#8209;8
Authors:
Peter M. Bednar
Christine Welch
Abstract:
As travellers, we are usually aware that a map is not the territory it represents. However, as researchers, inquiring into practice, are we always aware of the domain within which that practice is situated? Descriptions of practice sometimes suggest that this is not the case. For example, do engineers actually believe that the models they develop and use are reflections of some reality? It is likely that an engineer never actually follows his models when developing an artefact or process. Similarly, we can ask ourselves whether we believe that a chef actually cooks by following a recipe. Possibly, only someone who does not know how to cook would think so. These idealised models are simply the basis for discussionreflection and experimentation. It is sometimes the case, however, that descriptions of practice are produced based in a kind of rationality that suggests these misapprehensions are appropriate. In the context of research, can we say that postmodernism has any relevance? If, in the field of practice, only the uninitiated ever had illusions that the 'grand theories' of 'modernism' could be directly applicable, then informed research must recognize this also. To those with no illusions, such 'grand theories' were a basis for reflection and critique. Thus, to this extent we have always been 'modern' and still are. Rather than espousing a Postmodernist perspective, we might point to 'Hypermodernism' — a recognition that the 'grand theories' can only be used as metaphors, i.e. a basis for practical philosophy. By adopting such a stance, it is possible to avoid a false step of fighting 'straw men' and dismissing as worthless research that which could be useful material for reflection and learning when juxtaposed with other perspectives on practice. Models and explanatory frameworks within which research has been conducted need not be rejected as 'modernist' if there is recognition of their useful role as metaphor. At the same time, we suggest a need for a critically&#8209;informed approach to research which sheds light upon taken&#8209;for&#8209;granted assumptions and naïve rationalities, illuminating metaphor and stimulating reflection.

Individualised Rating&#8209;Scale Procedure: A Means of Reducing Response Style Contamination in Survey Data?
Pages:
pp9&#8209;20
Authors:
Elisa Chami-Castaldi

Abstract:
Response style bias has been shown to seriously contaminate the substantive results drawn from survey data; particularly those conducted using cross&#8209;cultural samples. As a consequence, identification of response formats that suffer least from response style bias has been called for. Previous studies show that respondents' personal characteristics, such as age, education level and culture, are connected with response style manifestation.   Differences in the way respondents interpret and utilise researcher&#8209;defined fixed rating&#8209;scales (e.g. Likert formats), poses a problem for survey researchers. Techniques that are currently used to remove response bias from survey data are inadequate as they cannot accurately determine the level of contamination present and frequently blur true score variance. Inappropriate rating&#8209;scales can impact on the level of response style bias manifested, insofar as they may not represent respondents' cognitions. Rating&#8209;scale lengths that are too long present respondents with some response categories that are not 'meaningful', whereas rating&#8209;scales that are too short force respondents into compressing their cognitive rating&#8209;scales into the number of response categories provided (this can cause ERS contamination — extreme responding). We are therefore not able to guard against two respondents, who share the same cognitive position on a continuum, reporting their stance using different numbers on the rating&#8209;scale provided. This is especially problematic where a standard fixed rating&#8209;scale is used in cross&#8209;cultural surveys.  This paper details the development of the Individualised Rating&#8209;Scale Procedure (IRSP), a means of extracting a respondent's 'ideal' rating&#8209;scale length, and as such 'designing out' response bias, for use as the measurement instrument in a survey. Whilst the fundamental ideas for self&#8209;anchoring rating&#8209;scales have been posited in the literature, the IRSP was developed using a series of qualitative interviews with participants. Finally, we discuss how the IRSP's reliability and validity can be quantitatively assessed and compared to typical fixed researcher&#8209;defined rating&#8209;scales, such as the Likert format.

A Framework for Mixed Stakeholders and Mixed Methods

Authors:

Abstract:
Balancing stakeholder expectations and requirements is frequently a challenge for the ethical researcher contracted to evaluate government&#8209;funded community projects. Invariably these projects involve people from diverse backgrounds with their own agenda and expectations for the project. This was the scenario for adopting a mixed&#8209;method evaluation of Wellington's Smart Newtown community computing project where free Internet access as well as some computer skills training was made available at the newly&#8209;established computing centres. The four&#8209;year, multiple stakeholder evaluation project involved qualitative and quantitative approaches, situated within a five&#8209;purpose conceptual framework of: triangulation, complementarily, development, initiation, and expansion. The framework provided a robust platform that ensured a systematic and thorough approach in both collection and analysis of data. In this paper we describe the application of each "purpose" of the framework to the different data sets that resulted in an objective, impartial evaluation which was subsequently used for deciding future directions of publicly&#8209;funded community computing centres.

Active Exploration of Emerging Themes in a Study of Object&#8209;Oriented Requirements Engineering: The "Evolutionary Case" Approach
Pages:
pp29&#8209;42
Authors:
Linda Dawson
Abstract:
The evolutionary case approach provides a framework for qualitative case study research in information systems (IS). It uses revelation, reinforcement, reflection and re&#8209;examination to explicitly explore emerging themes in interpretive case study research.   The method is based on the progressive development of a theoretical model grounded initially in the literature and then refined using sequential case studies grounded in practice. The method addresses the gap which often separates data from conclusions in qualitative case study research by documenting the "revealed" and "reinforced" changes in the theoretical model as it evolves from the empirical data.  The paper provides an illustrative study of the use of models in object&#8209;oriented requirements engineering to demonstrate the use of the evolutionary case approach.

Best Practices in Project Management Through a Grounded Theory Lens

Authors:
Svetla Georgieva
George Allan
Abstract:
Grounded Theory is still regarded with skepticism as a research methodology by many academics so this paper has been specifically constructed using recent research to illustrate the rigour of the Grounded Theory Methodology. An investigation into 'best practice amongst European Project Managers used the Grounded Theory Methodology to analyse interview data. This paper reports on that practical application of the Grounded Theory Methodology and contributes to the growing literature on the use of Grounded Theory as a research methodology. The three individual data analysis methods of Open&#8209;Coding, Constant Comparison, and Memorising are shown in operation and can be seen producing the findings. These findings are then operated on with the Grounded Theory method of Theoretical Coding and some deeply influential conclusions come out of this data analysis. The whole Grounded Theory methodology can be seen in operation and the concepts and categories can be seen emerging from the data. The contribution to the discipline of computing will be published elsewhere in technical journals but the research method is the main aim of this paper in this conference.

University Academics' Psychological Contracts in Australia: A Mixed Method Research Approach
Pages:
pp61&#8209;72
Authors:
Branka Krivokapic-Skoko
Grant O'Neill
Abstract:
It has been argued that in a workplace environment that is characterised by significant change and uncertainty, the formation and content of the psychological contracts are of increasing importance regarding levels of employee trust, satisfaction, commitment and motivation, and teaching and research outcomes. While research has clearly demonstrated that psychological contracts can have considerable impact upon workplace relations and employee performance, research into the formation, content and effects of psychological contracts between academics and the University has been very limited.   The paper used a sequential multi methods research design to explore the formation and content of psychological contracts established by the academics within an Australian University. The empirical research began with exploratory focus group discussions which were followed by a mail survey. The focus groups were carried first to identify the issues and themes that can subsequently be drawn upon to assist with development of relevant survey questions. Focus groups sought to elicit insights and subjective interpretations of the psychological contracts and the consequences of perceived fulfilment or breach. This, first qualitative phase of research has identified four key foci of academic responsibility that greatly influenced the formation and effects of the psychological contracts that have been formed, and these are: the University, the discipline, society, and students. These four categories were used later on to further develop the questionnaire and carry out exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of a larger survey of the academics. Using exploratory factor analysis of the survey data, eight factors were discovered relating to the University's obligations to its employees and three underlying factors were found in relation to individual academic's obligations to the University. In terms of the University's obligation to the academics, the EFA reinforces the importance of leadership and management, fairness and equity (notably in relation to promotion and provision of opportunities for career development). In terms of the academics' perceived obligations to the university, the EFA points to the importance of role expectations and commitment to the job and student learning.

Millennial Students and Technology Choices for Information Searching
Pages:
pp73&#8209;76
Authors:
Martin Rich
Abstract:
This paper draws together ideas about different generations of students, notably the 'millennial generation' (born from around 1982 to 2000) which encompasses a high proportion of current students in higher education, and ideas about the different types of technology available when searching for information. In the context of higher education, this is particularly relevant when students are encouraged to find out information for themselves, typically to relate this to taught material. This is connected with information literacy, as it reflects students' abilities to carry out simple or complex research. This paper focuses on why students choose particular technologies to support their research and the effect of these choices on their learning and on their written work.  A particular current issue is the emergence of the generation of Internet resources collectively known as 'web 2.0' notably Blogs and Wikis — and the relationship of these to the way that students presently in universities favour structuring their work. These resources also introduce issues of authoritativeness. It is tempting to dismiss wikipedia as the work of amateurs, but where a blog has been created by a notable expert, author, or journalist, questions arise as to whether the blog should be regarded as of different value from the same person's written work. Therefore some consideration will be given to how students can be encouraged to recognise and draw on intelligent exploitation of these new resources.  Underlying data for the paper is drawn from discussions with current students, both individually and in groups.

White Researcher&#8209;Black Subjects: Exploring the Challenges of Researching the Marginalised and 'Invisible'
Pages:
pp77&#8209;84
Authors:
Gisela Schulte Agyeman
Abstract:
How to access the life world of the Other without mis&#8209;representing it, has long been a concern in a number of research traditions, including disability, feminist and black research traditions. Feminist debates have addressed issues such as whether researchers can only speak on behalf of their own social groups or whether there is legitimacy in speaking on behalf of the Other. Justification for this often arises from the fact that dis&#8209;empowered groups may not have access to a public forum where they can be heard, so that social researchers see their role as 'giving a voice' to those who would otherwise not be heard. By contrast, other researchers see commonalities with their respondents as a particular strength. The paper focuses on theoretical perspectives which provided the framework in a study of the lived experiences and expressed views of second&#8209;generation female young people of African and Caribbean heritage in predominantly white community and school settings. It examines some of the theoretical as well as personal considerations of a white female researcher and educational practitioner whose personal position and interests had to be negotiated within the research process. The paper highlights some of the difficulties, dilemmas and challenges of a white researcher attempting to access the lived realities of ethnic minority children whose lives are 'invisible' in dominant discourses. Drawing on theoretical perspectives from the feminist, black and disability literature, the paper explores the implications for researching 'sensitive' topics in organisational contexts from the perspective of an outsider 'looking in' and argues for a conscious 'positioning' of the researcher who may or may not be part of the lifeworld of individuals or groups being researched.

Issues and Challenges in the Use of Template Analysis: Two Comparative Case Studies from the Field.

pp85&#8209;94
Authors:
Teresa Waring
David Wainwright
Abstract:
One of the most problematic issues for researchers who conduct qualitative research using semi&#8209;structured, unstructured interviews or story telling data collection methods is the analysis of large quantities of rich data. In the past this has often led to fairly unmethodical approaches to analysis which in turn has led to qualitative business and management research being seen as insubstantial and unworthy of consideration.  A relatively recent development in organisational research has been the application of Template Analysis to rich unstructured qualitative data following the primary data collection phase. Template Analysis appears to have emerged from the USA during the 1990s and academics familiar with the Grounded Theory approach to data analysis may see similarities in the techniques used. Nevertheless, it has gained credibility in the UK through the work of Nigel King and other colleagues researching in health and sociology related fields.  This paper provides an overview of the origins of Template Analysis and discusses how it has been used to structure qualitative data. It then goes on to examine through the two case studies how Template Analysis has been extended and used by the authors in two different research projects. In the first case study the research team worked within a Primary Care Trust in the North East of England on a project that explored the Diffusion of Innovation of clinical and administrative computer systems across General Practice within the Trust. Seventeen Trust members were interviewed for approximately one hour and this led to over 85000 words of rich data. The second project focused on the NHS Secondary Care sector and examined IT project management practice related to the development of integrated pathology computing systems across eight separate laboratories in the North of England. Eight senior managers were interviewed and this, combined with participant observation and over 3 years of document collection, also resulted in a large volume of rich textual material. The use of template analysis, combined with a critical success factors methodology, resulted in a novel approach for learning about current IT project management practices.  This paper critically examines these two case studies in terms of their particular research philosophy, epistemological approach and the lessons learnt from the techniques employed. The paper then provides a discussion of the principles and practicalities of template analysis and explores the benefits to the business and management research community at large.

Abstract:
A study was conducted to compare the response rate of telephone interview and Web Survey in Saudi Arabia utilizing Internet usage statistics, as well as experimental design. Official data shows that the reason that led the majority of Saudi people to choose not to interact with Web Survey similarly to the telephone interview is not technical due to the lack of Internet coverage, but rather cultural. Furthermore, the experimental part demonstrates three main findings. First, the response rate to the Web Survey is significantly lower than to the telephone interview. Second, Saudi males participated significantly more than females especially with the Web Survey though both had the same level of Internet access. Third, the average response rate of telephone interview is significantly above 95% for both genders, whereas the average response rate of the Web Survey is about 30%.

Pragmatic Research Design: an Illustration of the Use of the Delphi Technique

pp133&#8209;140
Authors:

Noel Pearse
Abstract:
The creation of wealth is an important issue in any society, and entrepreneurship is regarded as an important catalyst in the creation of new wealth. This presents a challenge to develop entrepreneurship successfully. An important site for the development of entrepreneurship is higher education. The challenge however, is that there is a lack of a general understanding on how to educate students for entrepreneurship. In addition, current thought and practice on entrepreneurship education is historically biased, implying that graduates are essentially prepared for the past instead of for the future. From the perspective of higher education, the problem is how to develop current students to be entrepreneurial in the future. What is needed is to project into the future and then to develop an understanding of what should be taught as well as how it should be taught today.  A versatile research technique that can assist in achieving this objective is the Delphi technique, as it is used to conduct futures research or research into areas where knowledge is incomplete. The Delphi method is a type of group interview, using the collective opinion of knowledgeable experts. The technique makes use of several rounds of data collection and feedback to create a consensus of opinion.   Making use of the Delphi technique, research is being designed that will formulate expert&#8209;based strategic guidelines on entrepreneurial education within the South African higher education sector. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the research design considerations that arise in the use of the Delphi technique for this purpose and how they are addressed.   The main characteristics of the Delphi are presented and arguments for the use of the Delphi within a constructivist paradigm are discussed. Practical issues related to the design of the Delphi, panel&#8209;member selection, and the formulation of panel questions, are examined. In illustrating these design considerations, the paper demonstrates a pragmatic approach to research design as well as the importance of creating coherence between the research question, the research paradigm, the research method and its use, encouraging research practitioners to adopt a more systematic, deliberate and philosophically&#8209;based approach to research design.

Undertaking a Structured Literature Review or Structuring a Literature Review: Tales from the Field
Pages:
pp141&#8209;152
Authors:
Andrew Armitage
Diane Keeble-Allen
Abstract:
The diversity of sources of literature within the management disciplines has resulted in a growing need for a systematic methodology to map the territory of its associated theories and models. As such, when scoping out a doctoral or policy based study the Structured Literature Review (SLR) as espoused by Tranfield et al (2003) can be considered as a means by which critical literature central to and underpinning the research can be rigorously and systematically mapped out. However, there is little guidance, or evidence, of this being the case when undertaking small scale projects for example undergraduate or masters degree dissertations. This paper reports four case studies using semi&#8209;structured interviews of master's degree students following management programmes who undertook a Structured Literature Review (SLR) based dissertation and the issues and problems they had to encounter during their journey. The findings from the case studies suggest that Tranfield et al's (2003) approach to SLR's, whilst suited to doctoral level and policy based research is not appropriate when dealing with undergraduate and masters dissertations and projects. The case study findings identified that these students conducting a SLR had to deal with a new set of conceptual, methodological and data collection problems relating to this 'unorthodox' approach to conducting a postgraduate research dissertation. The findings show that students had to confront new paradigms of enquiry that are not normally taught or found in 'traditional' research texts and research methods courses that are taught on degree programmes. However, the findings do reveal that students gained a greater depth and insight into the subject they were researching through a more rigorous and structured approach. The paper then presents alternative remedies by way of the Rapid Structured Literature Review (RSLR) research strategy which is argued as an appropriate approach in conducting small scale literature based research projects when used with undergraduate and master's degree students rather than the SLR espoused by Tranfield et al (2003) which is better suited for other types of research such as doctoral and policy based activities.

Peter A. Dyer
Abstract:
Both Governmentality and accounts of collaborative ethnographic study are well served by the academic literature. However, this discussion focuses upon discourses that circulate around the debate of meat hygiene practice and how it mediates through implementing organizational and regulatory change. This study subtly illuminates the differing expectations and gaze of the researcher and sponsor relationship. It sketches the degrees of control for both, as each search for insights into existing practice, exposing challenging attitudes and communicating the need for change within a watchful public realm. Finally, it also traces how the research objectives evolved from challenges to organizational change to notions of 'Communities of Practice' (Lave and Wenger, 1991).

Abstract:
This paper aims to provide an example for developing a measurement scale by using car rental services as a case. To do so, both qualitative and quantitative methods are utilized in three fundamental stages recommended by Churchill (1979) and Parasuraman, Zeithaml & Berry (1988). In following their footsteps, the first qualitative research was undertaken in the form of 23 in&#8209;depth interviews which produced 61 items that described user perceptions. Then, a quantitative study was undertaken to purify the scale items, examine dimensionality, reliability, factor structure and validity. After a rigorous statistical analysis an 18&#8209;itemed scale with six factors emerged. The paper also introduces the setting of the research and presents need for scale development briefly which is followed by discussion, implications and limitations.

Building Knowledge — Developing a Grounded Theory of Knowledge Management for Construction
Pages:
pp175&#8209;182
Authors:
Brian Graham
Ken Thomas
Abstract:
As part of an on&#8209;going doctoral study, a constructivist approach to grounded theory is being used to develop an integrated model of knowledge management (KM) for the leading Irish construction organisations. Using multiple data collection methods; employees in a number of these organisations have participated, from recent graduates through to senior managers. While the need to effectively manage knowledge within large construction organisations is well recognised, a gap exists between the theory of KM and its implementation in practice. This paper considers the research in terms of its philosophical position, the use of grounded theory and the research methods utilised, from theoretical and practical perspectives. Progress in the study thus far is presented and future directions considered in achieving theoretical saturation and a well developed model. It is anticipated that the study will contribute to the field of construction management where further empirical research into KM is required. Much previous research in the area of KM in construction has focussed solely on technological, cultural or strategic issues in the development of KM models. The developed integrated model will form the basis of education and guidance resources on KM for the leading Irish construction organisations. As a traditional and pragmatic industry, the rationale for using grounded theory is provided from the viewpoint that it requires researchers to focus upon developing theory which produces explanations that are recognisable to the subjects of the research. In order to ensure the credibility of the developed model, it will be evaluated by industry as part of a pilot KM education programme, with further refinement if necessary.

Abstract:
This paper provides suggestions of doing a grounded theory business research. The main intention is to provide guidelines and suggestions for novice researchers, students and their supervisors in conducting a grounded theory business research. The main discussion of this paper will focus on the principles driving a grounded theory research, the choice between the two versions of grounded theory, the research problem, the purpose of the study, the research questions, and the place of literature review in a grounded theory study. In addition, an example of how a grounded theory was induced from data is illustrated. Its purpose is to illustrate how the procedures of data analysis, theoretical memoing and theoretical sampling were used to progressively to generate a grounded theory. In conclusion, the specific skills required by the researchers attempting a grounded theory study are suggested.

Abstract:
Researchers performing literature searches are increasingly using bibliographic databases as their initial and dominant resource. While the increasing number, volume and ease of access to academic and other databases potentially speeds searching, researchers require a rapidly evolving set of skills to do this efficiently. Current literature on this topic and research organisations developing techniques in this area are discussed. Aspects to be considered when designing search filters to extract relevant literature are also detailed. Further method development by the author performed during a systematic literature search on the topic of Barriers and constraints for women leaders is additionally examined.

Authors:
Polly Sobreperez
Abstract:
Qualitative techniques for the collection of empirical materials are classically identified as including interviews and observations. However a further technique has more recently emerged known as the group interview or focus group, which may be applicable only to certain types of research situation but is widely overlooked and can add a level of knowledge and richness not available through other techniques. This paper follows the growth of focus group research, looks for situations in Information Systems research where this technique gives unique insights, and describes the conduct and application of the technique in a case study setting. An example of a useful structuring technique is described and conclusions are drawn concerning a particular type of focus group in information systems qualitative research which may well be useful in other research scenarios.

Researching Spirituality and Meaning in the Workplace

Authors:

Abstract:
In this paper we begin to address the topic of researching spirituality in the workplace. The notion of spirituality at work has been an increasing focus of attention in the academic literature over the last 10 years or so, with several special editions of journals being dedicated to the topic. However, we find at least two areas of this work so far to be problematic. One aspect relates to the apparent ambiguity relating to the term 'spirituality' in itself and, especially, in comparison to the use of the word 'religion'. Another aspect refers to the motives and drivers behind the study of workplace spirituality and the search for 'higher meaning'. In essence, we find the predominant objectives behind the research to be highly instrumental. Sometimes this seems to be deliberately espoused but sometimes it is more hidden. This paper attempts a preliminary critical review of the field with a special emphasis on the issues it raises for the researcher.  In particular, we seek to show how the way in which 'spirituality' is conceived and constructed directly affects decisions related to methodological choice and (ultimately) to research design itself. We close the paper by reflecting on the importance of the topic and yet the dangers inherent in appearing to trivialise its nature.

Title:
The Research Audit Trial — Enhancing Trustworthiness in Qualitative Inquiry
Pages:
pp11&#8209;24
Authors:
Marian Carcary
Abstract:
Positivist and interpretivist researchers have different views on how their research outcomes may be evaluated. The issues of validity, reliability and generalisability, used in evaluating positivist studies, are regarded of relatively little significance by many qualitative researchers for judging the merits of their interpretive investigations. In confirming the research, those three canons need at least to be re&#8209;conceptualised in order to reflect the keys issues of concern for interpretivists. Some interpretivists address alternative issues such as credibility, dependability and transferability when determining the trustworthiness of their qualitative investigations. A strategy proposed by several authors for establishing the trustworthiness of the qualitative inquiry is the development of a research audit trail. The audit trail enables readers to trace through a researcher's logic and determine whether the study's findings may be relied upon as a platform for further enquiry. While recommended in theory, this strategy is rarely implemented in practice. This paper examines the role of the research audit trail in improving the trustworthiness of qualitative research. Further, it documents the development of an audit trail for an empirical qualitative research study that centred on an interpretive evaluation of a new Information and Communication Technology (ICT) student administrative system in the tertiary education sector in the Republic of Ireland. This research study examined the impact of system introduction across five Institutes of Technology (IoTs) through case study research that incorporated multiple evidence sources. The evidence collected was analysed using a grounded theory method, which was supported by qualitative data analysis software. The key concepts and categories that emerged from this process were synthesized into a cross case primary narrative; through reflection the primary narrative was reduced to a higher order narrative that presented the principle findings or key research themes. From this higher order narrative a theoretical conjecture was distilled. Both a physical and intellectual audit trail for this study are presented in this paper. The physical audit trail documents all keys stages of a research study and reflects the key research methodology decisions. The intellectual audit trail, on the other hand, outlines how a researcher's thinking evolved throughout all phases of the study. Hence, these audit trails make transparent the key decisions taken throughout the research process. The paper concludes by discussing the value of this audit trail process in confirming a qualitative study's findings.

Title:
Using Personal and Online Repertory Grid Methods for the Development of a Luxury Brand Personality
Pages:
pp25&#8209;38
Authors:
Klaus Heine
Abstract:
Interest has been growing in the brand personality concept, because it offers a systematic approach for developing symbolic benefits, which are becoming more and more essential for brand differentiation. Although they are a distinctive feature of luxury brands and often even exceed their functional benefits, there is still no personality concept designed especially for luxury brands. The aim of this article is therefore to develop and implement an appropriate methodology for developing a luxury brand personality. In contrast to the common quantitative approach, the article proposes a qualitative methodology including the Repertory Grid Method (RGM) and explains its benefits. It was implemented with a survey of 31 German millionaires who can be described as heavy luxury consumers. The content analyses of the data uncovered five personality dimensions including, for example, Modernity, which relates to the temporal perspective of a brand. The study extends the RGM areas of application and demonstrates its applicability in developing brand personality dimensions. The validity of the results improves if they are replicated with other studies and with varying research methodologies. To this end, recent developments in Web 2.0 provide a great source of inspiration. As a result, a complementary study was conducted to exploit these opportunities for online RGM and to allow for a more in&#8209;depth understanding about the personality dimensions. The article builds upon an overview of qualitative online research, common online RGM and the idea of Web 2.0 to expand the methodological toolbox with collaborative RGM that allows respondents to build on the input of previous participants. The procedure was simplified in line with the explorative approach and implemented with a specially programmed online tool. The results support the five personality dimensions and give further insights into adequate brand personality traits. The article concludes with a discussion of the results and benefits of collaborative RGM for researchers and marketers.

Abstract:
This paper discusses the role of the researcher as a participant observer and reflective practitioner. The paper aims to assess the benefits and limitations of participant observation, and offer guidance as to how to manage the challenges inherent in this technique. The paper draws on the lead author's experience as a participant observer when working on her doctoral thesis: 'Factors Affecting the Viability of Electronic Marketplaces: an Empirical Investigation into International Steel Trading'. It discusses the issues and concerns resulting from participant observation and how these were dealt with in the case example. The empirical research was a longitudinal study tracking the evolution of steel electronic commerce between December 1998 and the present time. The events examined in this study were observed during the lead author's ten years at a large steel producertrading house. As a trader and a manager, the lead author was directly involved in the conduct of business. The study represents the contribution of an industry practitioner and, as such, provides a unique insight into a real&#8209;world setting.

Claiming the Streets: Feminist Implications of Psychogeography as a Business Research Method
Pages:
pp47&#8209;54
Authors:
Deborah Knowles
Abstract:
This paper is intended to establish a claim that the techniques of psychogeography may be advantageously employed in business and management research in order to provide a new perspective on how organisations are experienced. It examines this practice for its possibilities as a research approach for women and its compatibility with feminist research methods. Psychogeography offers an approach to gaining an understanding of the ways that human behaviour is shaped by the geographical environment (Coverley, 2006). It constitutes a style of collecting a variety of qualitative data using complementary methods, which gives a textured view of the real world in a particular environment. Psychogeography is primarily a literary tradition. However, its constituent parts are academic disciplines rooted in real world experience. The attraction of psychogeography to a business researcher is many layered. It invites the researcher to observe the environment slowly and painstakingly, whilst "strolling", and to construct meanings in a number of ways. Walking is celebrated by psychogeographers as a cultural act and an important way to understand the world, yet the male&#8209;as&#8209;norm character of psychogeographers is well established (Solnit, 2001). The masculine tradition of psychogeography may operate to challenge woman researchers to examine the possibility of using this approach in conjunction with feminist perspective research methods as a way of exploring and questioning women's place in a patriarchal culture (Acker et al, 1983). Feminist research methods seek to address the "invisibility" of women's experience in academic studies (Roberts, 1990:7), to overturn the male&#8209;as&#8209;norm perspective, and to highlight the possibilities for women to engage in 'male&#8209;preserve' activities. In the case of the male preserve of psychogeography these intentions would apply not only to the subject of the study but also to the practice of the research method itself.

Developing a new Perspective on Leadership Theory: From a Tree of Knowledge to a Rhizome of Contingencies
Pages:
pp55&#8209;66
Authors:
Chris Mortimer
Abstract:
Does the discursive formation of leadership theory hinder the development and practise of alternative leadership styles in the UK? This research question is in response to the issues summarised in the PriceWaterhouseCooper's 2008 report on Key Trends in Human Capital. Eight years into the new millennium, leadership is still at the top of the human capital agenda. Although companies invest considerable amounts of money in leadership development, the report suggests that there is limited evidence of leadership programmes delivering value for money, and that three in every ten leaders in the UK do not demonstrate essential leadership qualities. This indicates issues with the practical application of leadership research. The common denominator of all leadership research and application is the leadership theories. The theories are an easily comprehensible, continuous series of events that lead into the present of leadership, supporting all leadership research. Unquestioned assumptions support the theory framework, becoming commonly accepted truths. These suppositions include; the grounding of theory and research in reality; leadership is a fundamental component of the human condition; that social and economic progress has only been possible due to leadership, together with the unquestioned dismissal of alternative voices. Finally there is a notion that leadership theory evolves, drawing on a Darwinian event of natural selection, by evoking biological empirical science to explain a discursive structure. The research and the subject of this paper is to challenge the assumptions and framework of leadership theory through the creation of a research strategy based on Foucault's methods, creating a rhizome of contingencies rather than a progressive tree of knowledge. The paper will address definitions of the archive, archaeology and genealogy, as contextualised within the research.

Researching Organizational Culture Using the Grounded Theory Method

pp67&#8209;74
Authors:
Noel Pearse
MacDonald Kanyangale
Abstract:
Researching organizational culture using the grounded theory method is intuitively logical, given the ease of conceptualising organizational culture as a basic social process. In spite of its intuitive appeal, there are numerous challenges along the research voyage that could facilitate or jeopardise the unsuspecting researcher's investigation. The aim of this paper is to alert prospective researchers, to some of the critical considerations that arise when designing and conducting research of this nature. The paper first tackles issues that are related to the conceptualisation of organizational culture as the phenomenon of interest, before turning to the research design implications. Research considerations that are related to the conceptualisation of organizational culture and the formulation of the research, include (1) the school of thought that the researcher embraces and the implications of its research traditions; (2) the assumptions made about the nature of organizational culture (such as its degree of uniformity or variation, its definition and construction, and its stability and development over time) and the implications for its investigation; (3) the contextual characteristics of the study (such as the size of the organization being investigated) and their implications for the manifestation of organizational culture; and (4) the researcher's values and interests and their implications for accessing credible data. Other than the implications of conceptualisation of organizational culture on the formulation of the research problem, further research design considerations discussed include (1) aligning the researcher's ontological and epistemological assumptions with the assumptions made about organizational culture; (2) identifying sources of data and techniques for its collection, that are appropriate to the conceptualisation of culture and its temporal characteristics in particular; and (3) reconciling the level of data collection with its level of analysis in order to aggregate and reconcile various individual perspectives of a collective social construct.

Abstract:
The effect of culture has been popular topic in recent information system research. However, it is not a simple task to either collect or analyze data containing elements of "culture". This paper presents previous literature on how to measure culture, the theoretical background how to build this construct and a short description of empirical study we conducted in a multicultural environment. Our research topic was to examine the usage of health information exchange systems in two different kinds of healthcare sectors (i.e. Finland and USA). Finally we reflect on our experiences both in collecting data as well as in analyzing it through the lenses of cultural differences. Strengths and weaknesses of multicultural data collection are discussed together with opportunities and threats of analyzing data with the purpose of finding cultural elements.

Abstract:
A 2007&#8209;2008 two&#8209;nation business survey was carried out by two universities and supporting business development agencies. The intention of describing small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and their use of information technology and cooperation was disrupted by a very low response rate. Some practices concerning nonresponse (Rogelberg & Stanton, 2007) are discussed and implemented. The collected data are compared to data known in advance from registers for the nonresponding companies. Also, a second data set with concise answer information from nonrespondents was obtained by phone for categorization of the nonrespondents. Finally the nonresponse is related to data about contact between the companies and business development agencies to illuminate interest as the dependent variable. The article is an investigation into nonresponse at the organizational level and demonstrates throughout the article how facts obtained by other methods (multi mode) besides the central survey can improve the understanding of nonresponse.

Googling Companies — a Webometric Approach to Business Studies
Pages:
pp93&#8209;106
Authors:
Esteban Romero-Frías
Abstract:
So far Internet studies have focused mainly on using website content for gathering business information, however web hyperlinks have not been exploited enough for business purposes yet. Webometric techniques are based on the exploitation of information contained in the hyperlinks that connect the different documents contained on the Web. Webometrics could be considered as a new discipline that applies bibliometric techniques to the quantitative study of the Web, but also a discipline that progressively develops its own concepts and methodology. So far studies in this field have focused on academic and scholarly web spaces; however this methodology is equally applicable to commercial sites which are more predominant on the Web. This paper is intended to show how webometric techniques could be applied to business and management studies. Therefore, it describes a number of basic concepts and techniques and the way in which they have been applied to these fields so far. Firstly, some studies found that the number of links pointing to companies' websites correlates significantly with the business performance measures of the entity. This finding suggests that links to a website could be used as a timely indicator of business performance. Secondly, the examination of co&#8209;links, which refers to webpages that links two business sites simultaneously, have been used for competitive intelligence purposes. These studies are based on the idea that the number of co&#8209;links to the websites of a pair of companies is a measure of the similarity between them. For instance, this similarity measure between companies in the same industry can provide information about their competitive positions. Finally, motivations for the creation of hyperlinks to business sites could be analysed through a content analysis approach in order to get confirmation about the business relevance and nature of links. This view complements the quantitative perspective to link and co&#8209;link research, providing a brand new approach to business studies.

Mixed Methodology Approach to Place Attachment and Consumption Behaviour: a Rural Town Perspective
Pages:
pp107&#8209;116
Authors:
Maria Ryan
Abstract:
This paper discusses the use of both qualitative and quantitative methodologies in examining the influence people's attachment to their environment had on a number of consumption behaviours made by residents of a regional town in Western Australia. It discusses the concept of place attachment; its relationship with community attachment and the subsequent perceived value ascribed to living in the regional town of Narrogin, Western Australia. The use of a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods provided an opportunity to take a macro perspective in quantifying major place and community attachment influencers in the consumption decision&#8209;making process, while understanding the meanings and sentiment behind these concepts from a micro perspective. In&#8209;depth interviews were undertaken with thirty&#8209;two residents of Narrogin. These interviews used a photo&#8209;elicitation technique in which residents were given a camera and required to take photographs of important places, people and aspects of their lives. The photos were then used as prompts for personal interviews, as respondents discussed the meaning, sentiments and stories behind the chosen photographs. The interviews provided a richness and depth to our understanding of the value of respondents' attachment to Narrogin. The use of this technique as a forerunner to the quantitative phase is discussed and recommendations for future use are detailed. The second phase of data collection involved a telephone survey of residents from Narrogin and its surrounding area (Shire of Narrogin). This was designed to test a model and a number of hypotheses developed from the literature and the qualitative phase of the research. The model presented place and community attachment as separate, yet related constructs affecting the perceived value ascribed to living in Narrogin. Value was seen as a mediating construct between place and community attachment and consumption (shopping and staying in Narrogin) decisions. Shopping decisions included shopping for everyday grocery items, white goods, farm equipment and machinery and various services including educational, medical and aged care. Exploratory Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modelling were used to examine the prescribed model. The results identified different attachment weightings for the town and shire communities. In general, the model was a better predictor for the shire residents than it was for town residents. The results suggest different types of management strategies are required for businesses providing for the needs of town and for shire residents based on respective residents different attachment weightings. The paper discusses the use of the photo&#8209;elicitation technique in the in&#8209;depth interview stage of the research and its contribution to the development of the model as presented in the quantitative phase. Operationalising the constructs in this study has been, and still is, challenging for researchers. This paper provides valuable insights into the operationalisation process by utilising the combined methodologies approach. Uncovering stories, meanings and emotions can be integrated with an objective epistemology of attachment.

Title:
Characteristics of Single&#8209;Item Measures in Likert Scale Format
Pages:
pp1&#8209;12
Authors:
Aliosha Alexandrov
Abstract:
The use of single&#8209;item measures has been encouraged by several authors asserting that single&#8209;item measures are appropriate and can substitute multiple&#8209;item measures in many cases. This study focuses on the characteristics of single&#8209;item measures in Likert scale format. There are two motives behind it: first, the Likert scale has been called problematic and its usage discouraged by the very proponents of single&#8209;item measures; and second, the reverse wording of Likert items has led to many problems with multiple&#8209;item measures. Because the Likert scale is one of the most used scales in marketing and management, and more researchers may decide to use single&#8209;item measures in Likert scale format, it becomes necessary to answer the question if it is usable or not. This research scrutinizes the characteristics of the Likert scale in a positive&#8209;negative continuum: from positive to negative with different levels of intensities. Based on collected sample data for three popular computer brands, the main conclusion is that only positively worded Likert items with a fairly high level of intensity should be used as single&#8209;item measures. The supporting empirical evidence includes: (1) positively and negatively worded items are not true opposites, (2) items with reversed scores inflate means, (3) items with neutral intensity have unique conceptual meaning, (4) dependent variables are predicted best by independent variables with similar intensity and (5) negatively worded items contain a method factor that limits their ability to capture the measured concept. The results also suggest that the effect of the method factor is expressed more when respondents are not familiar with the object of the measured concept. The findings in this study provide guidelines for the practical use of measures in Likert format. Scales in other formats should undergo similar scrutiny.

The Factors that Influence Adoption and Usage Decision in SMEs: Evaluating Interpretive Case Study Research in Information Systems
Pages:
pp13&#8209;24
Authors:
Japhet Lawrence
Abstract:
The conventions for evaluating information systems case studies conducted according to the natural science model of social science are now widely accepted, as a valid research strategy within the Information System research community. While these criteria are useful in evaluating case study research conducted according to the natural science model of social science, however, they are inappropriate for interpretive research. The nature and purpose of interpretive research differs from positivist research. Although, there are no agreed criteria for evaluating research of this kind, nonetheless, there must be some criteria by which the quality of interpretive research can be evaluated. This paper evaluates a case study research conducted under the interpretive philosophy. The paper discusses the criteria proposed by Myers (1997) for evaluating interpretive research in information systems.

Strategies for Gaining Access in Doing Fieldwork: Reflection of two Researchers
Pages:

Authors:

Abstract:
One of greatest pitfalls in conducting research successfully is the inability to obtain access to the research field. Obtaining access to the research field can vary to a considerable extent, depending on the kind of cases being investigated. In fact, researchers often spend considerable amount of time on this task. However, many researchers do not even describe their access to the research field in their research reports. The main aim of this paper is to share the experiences of two researchers in gaining access to fieldwork practice. We believe that the issues we discuss based on our experiences in gaining access would benefit other qualitative researchers. We also hope that comparing the experiences of two different researchers in two very different research fields would help highlight issues which are often neglected in doing qualitative research. In this paper, we present our comparison of the different approaches we used in the various stages in gaining access. We discuss our strategies in gaining access using a four stage model: pre&#8209;entry, during fieldwork, after fieldwork and getting back. Finally, we present a basic framework for gaining access successfully which other researchers can use, and also critically analyze our experiences in using the two different approaches, formal and personal, in gaining access in our respective research projects.

Group Model Building Using System Dynamics: An Analysis of Methodological Frameworks
Pages:

Authors:
Celine Berard
Abstract:
The main objective of this paper is to study existing methodological frameworks on group modelling projects using system dynamics. Such projects are more and more applied in organizations in order to support their strategic decisions. In this research, key frameworks were first identified and then classified allowing for an in&#8209;depth analysis. The results of this analysis indicate that existing frameworks proposing a global vision of projects are scarce. Moreover, few of them consider both aspects of structure and process simultaneously. In addition, three crucial issues are highlighted: the elicitation of participants knowledge, the establishment of a consensus among participants, and the aspects of facilitation.

Abstract:
We develop a discursive understanding of organizational inquiry in order to challenge the status quo characterized by a positivistic approach to organizational inquiry. Specifically, we reconceptualize organizational science as an inherently rhetorical process. We propose that the language of theories and methods used within a particular paradigm move from figurative to literal and back to figurative, following a distinctive topological sequence from metaphor to metonymy to synecdoche to irony. We also link the researchers use of four master tropes to particular types of scientific reasoning as well as to particular types of scientific tools. We discuss the research implications of the rhetorical model of organizational science.

Title:
A Grounded Case of Enterprise Acquisition
Pages:
pp63&#8209;72
Authors:
David Douglas
Abstract:
To gain ‘real world’ understanding of the managerial approach adopted in an established small business when taken over by another entrepreneur from that of it’s predecessor. The research highlights perceptual differences internal stakeholders (employees and the new owner) have regarding the business and the managing of it. Illustrated are the commercial consequences that can ensue from the change of ownership of an established enterprise through to the managerial style perceived appropriate by a new entrepreneur, and, subsequent employees’ cognitions and behaviours that ensue as reactions to changed managerial practices. Findings are reviewed against existing theories within the fields of entrepreneurship, decision theory and management. Design/Methodology/Approach:  Situated within the qualitative paradigm, the unit of analysis being one small (nevertheless complex) organization affords the researcher opportunity to inquire deeply into case study phenomena. The unit of analysis soon develops, through the application of ‘original’ grounded theory methodology (utilizing depth interviews and observations), to being the human interactions of all actors within the organization. Discovering meanings and behaviours across a number of dimensions produces a rich textual account of actors’ perceptions of enterprise events and subsequent repercussions to the business. Findings: Emergent conceptual categories and supportive properties conveyed the new entrepreneur’s limited understanding of the business he had bought, along with his technical, managerial and decision&#8209;making style seemed insurmountable management impediments. Substantive theory that captured the social processes and phenomenological contentions from the grounded theory analysis conclude. Not wholly proffering generalisable pronouncements, the research presents a robust framework for further small enterprise research and grounded approaches to data capture and analysis. Implications:  Implications of the study will be of interest to entrepreneur and qualitative researchers, interested in the findings as a contribution to the field, and, the grounded theory methodology applied in establishing ontological ‘groundedness’ of inductively derived at theories. Originality/Value:  There is a paucity of such research outside the big business spectrum. Contributes at a ‘substantive’ level by focusing on the entrepreneur’s ‘post take&#8209;over’ management approach, and, at a more formal level through empirical ‘owner&#8209;manager&#8209;entrepreneurial’ research situated within the qualitative paradigm, where a deficiency of ‘depth’ cases remains. And especially for this forum, the findings are the result of meticulous attention to data gathering, analysis and emergent theory building, through the application of grounded theory methodology. Grounded theory has seen limited application to&#8209;date in the small business and entrepreneurship field.

Title:
Contextual Sensitivity in Grounded Theory: The Role of Pilot Studies
Pages:
pp73&#8209;84
Authors:
Miguel Baptista Nunes et al
Abstract:
Grounded Theory is an established methodological approach for context specific inductive theory building. The grounded nature of the methodology refers to these specific contexts from which emergent propositions are drawn. Thus, any grounded theory study requires not only theoretical sensitivity, but also a good insight on how to design the research in the human activity systems to be studied. The lack of this insight may result in inefficient theoretical sampling or even erroneous purposeful sampling. These problems would not necessarily be critical, as it could be argued that through the elliptical process that characterizes grounded theory, remedial loops would always bring the researcher to the core of the theory. However, these elliptical remedial processes can take very long periods of time and result in catastrophic delays in research projects. As a strategy, this paper discusses, contrasts and compares the use of pilot studies in four different grounded theory projects. Each pilot brought different insights about the context, resulting in changes of focus, guidance to improve data collection instruments and informing theoretical sampling. Additionally, as all four projects were undertaken by researchers with little experience of inductive approaches in general and grounded theory in particular, the pilot studies also served the purpose of training in interviewing, relating to interviewees, memoing, constant comparison and coding. This last outcome of the pilot study was actually not planned initially, but revealed itself to be a crucial success factor in the running of the projects. The paper concludes with a theoretical proposition for the concept of contextual sensitivity and for the inclusion of the pilot study in grounded theory research designs

Looking for Clues about Quality: A Multilevel Mixed Design on Quality Management in Greek Universities
Pages:
pp85&#8209;94
Authors:
Antigoni Papadimitriou
Abstract:
As methodology, mixed methods (MM) provide a means to facilitate and explain several complex phenomena across various disciplines. Tashakkori and Creswell (2008), identified a nurturing and dynamic intellectual community as one that encourages scholarly debate and intellectual risk&#8209;taking as well as developing graduate students as stewards of their disciplines. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to describe how a multilevel mixed design was applied to a research project designed to investigate the adoption of quality management in Greek universities through the lens of neo&#8209;institutional theory. Appropriate research design is a critical choice when performing organizational research, especially when the research lacks previous precedents; thus, this gap in the literature empirically investigated these issues by using MM, which led to a process in design development and compatibility to overcome many challenges. This paper presents part of the methodological and pragmatical rationales that guided the choice to use a multilevel study mixed method design by using both concurrent and sequential data collection at the macro, meso, and micro levels in Greek universities.

The Application of Mixed Methods in Organisational Research: A Literature Review
Pages:
pp95&#8209;105
Authors:
Jose Molina Azorin
Roslyn Cameron
Abstract:
Mixed methods research (the combined use of quantitative and qualitative methods in the same study) is becoming an increasingly popular approach in the discipline fields of sociology, psychology, education and health sciences. Calls for the integration of quantitative and qualitative research methods have been advanced in these fields. A key feature of mixed methods research is its methodological pluralism, which frequently results in research which provides broader perspectives than those offered by monomethod designs. The overall purpose and central premise of mixed methods is that the use of quantitative and qualitative approaches in combination provides a better understanding of research problems and complex phenomena than either approach alone. Despite calls for the combined use of quantitative and qualitative research in business and management studies, the use of mixed methods in business and management has seldom been studied. The purpose of this paper is to review the application of mixed methods research within organisational research. The study reported in this paper identifies the use of mixed methods in three organisational journals for the period 2003 to 2009: the Strategic Management Journal, Journal of Organizational Behavior and Organizational Research Methods. The landmark Tashakkori and Teddlie (2003) Handbook of mixed methods in social and behavioral research, played a pivotal role in providing both the visibility and credibility of mixed methods as a third methodological movement and since the publication of this seminal work the mixed methods movement has rapidly gained popularity. Business and management researchers need to be made aware of the growing use and acceptance of mixed methods research across business and organisational journals. This paper examines the main characteristics of mixed methods studies identified in the sample in terms of purposes and designs, and posits suggestions on the application of mixed methodologies.

Abstract:
This paper discusses an innovative focus group approach used to study an Information Systems Development (ISD) environment. The research had to cope with the application of a broad framework, untested in practice, seeking to elicit potentially highly sensitive opinions and judgments in a highly pressurised, time&#8209;restricted environment. The researchers’ design of the focus groups is discussed along with an evaluation of the final approach used. The paper concludes with a set of issues for future researchers to consider when designing focus groups for their own studies, along with a set of lessons learned and recommendations arising from the research team’s experience in this study

Title:
Identification and Motivation of Participants for Luxury Consumer Surveys
Pages:
pp132&#8209;145
Authors:
Klaus Heine
Abstract:
Luxury consumer behaviour is still a relatively new area of research, one that relies largely on paid surveys and especially on student samples. However, it is questionable whether moderately paid surveys really can attract wealthy heirs or busy managers or if students can imagine themselves in the role of experienced luxury consumers. In addition, many researchers hesitate to target luxury consumers. One reason is the ongoing discussion in the literature as to what constitutes a luxury consumer and as to how luxury consumers can be distinguished from non&#8209;luxury consumers and ultimately, how to identify them for empirical studies. What is more, this particular target group is notoriously hard to access and difficult to persuade to participate in any survey. Despite these problems, no article could be found in the literature, which addressed either the identification or the motivation of respondents for luxury consumer surveys (LCS). Therefore, the objective of this paper is to categorize and to discuss the means of identification and motivation of participants for LCS. Based on a literature analysis of existing LCS, the paper presents a categorization of the major research objectives, target groups, and identification methods for LCS. Subsequently, it provides an overview of common methods of participant motivation and discusses their suitability for LCS, which suggests thinking about some non&#8209;monetary incentives that could convince luxury consumers to participate in a survey in their own interest. As this idea coincides with the notion of viral marketing, it seems promising to adapt this concept for viral participant acquisition (VPA). Consequently, the paper presents a case study detailing the implement&#8209;ation of VPA on a recent LCS and concludes with the lessons learned.

Seizing the Opportunity: Using Availability Samples in Policy Programs for Creating Relevance in Broader Contexts

Authors:
Lien Beck et al
Abstract:
There is a growing interest within research in management studies to regard ‘organizational practice’ as a highly relevant field of empirical observation. Planned change projects turn out to be promising platforms for theorizing about practice, theory testing, and the innovation and improvement of organizational practices. However, natural contexts can also seriously limit the possibility to transfer the outcomes to broader contexts. Both external and construct validity are evidently a matter of serious concern in this kind of research. Field researchers are placed for difficult assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of their data set. What is the richness and added value of the data, what are the flaws that limit their value for other contexts, and what can be done to reduce the potential threats to external and construct validity? The present paper offers a practical roadmap that leads field researchers through a number of basic design considerations. The steps in the roadmap are illustrated by examples from a large&#8209;scale strategic development program for SMEs in the Euregion Meuse&#8209;and&#8209;Rhine.

Taking Stock of Research methods in Strategy as practice

Authors:
Ramya T Venkateswaran
Ganesh N Prabhu
Abstract:
Strategy&#8209;as&#8209;practice research provides understanding of a complex phenomenon in language rich and holistic process terms, rather than statistically significant but limited variance terms. It requires mapping individual and organisational activities in the process of strategizing. This article assesses four research issues in strategy&#8209;as&#8209;practice research and their impact in advancing this field: challenges in bounding the scope of the research question, issues with the unit of analysis, difficulties in defining the dependent variable of outcomes and finally the challenge in specifying a particular level of analysis, all of which present complexities in the design of data collection. We suggest two broad alternative approaches that have the potential to push the frontiers of methodology to greater rigour in strategy as practice research. First, quantification methods that can capture practice can be a valuable tool, a paradigm that has been ignored in much of strategy&#8209;as&#8209;practice research. Second, better process data may be revealed by organizations that voluntarily initiates a consultation process with a researcher as it benefits by doing so, so we suggest that clinical research methods, that include such intervention, provide better understanding of the phenomena of strategizing. We make a case for why these methods must for acceptability in strategy&#8209;as&#8209;practice research.

What Can We Learn from Gender Research
Pages:
pp1&#8209;9
Authors:
Eileen Trauth
Abstract:
This paper considers issues, insights and lessons about conducting research in business that are drawn from this author’s experiences with gender research in the information technology (IT) field over the past decade. A research program on gender and information technology (IT) is used as the basis for consideration of methodological insights for business research. The purpose in discussing gender research is not so much to focus on the findings of this work. Rather, the purpose is to focus on research issues that have or could arise, the learning from which is transferrable to business research. The reason is that there are similarities between gender research and business research. Both are action oriented in that the research is driven by real issues and practical problems. The research is conducted into the phenomenon in order to inform actions and interventions. This problem&#8209;orientation that drives business research also drives gender and IT research. Seven lessons relevant to business research methods are: the effect of data type, the choice of epistemology, the role of theory, building on disparate literature, the influence of researcher standpoint, stakeholder perspective that is privileged, and resolving the rigor vs. relevance conundrum. This review of insights for business research that is drawn from experiences with conducting research on gender and IT makes a case for increased methodological pluralism. Arguably, the degree to which institutions and publication outlets take these issues into account is indicative of their openness to exploring emergent topics. Methodological conservatism might be in order in some areas. But business research, which endeavors to respond to real world problems, needs to have the methodological tools available to respond to them. It must also be responsive to business trends and issues that might bring with them challenges for current methods for conducting research. New economic constraints, issues such as climate change that blur business area boundaries, globalization, social inclusion and innovation are 21st century issues that will encourage the research community to overcome resistance to different ideas, methodologies, epistemologies and theories.

Evidence Analysis using CAQDAS: Insights from a Qualitative Researcher
Pages:
pp10&#8209;24
Authors:
Marian Carcary
Abstract:
In data analysis the qualitative researcher seeks to produce a convincing explanation of the phenomena under investigation. Data analysis is an iterative process and requires reflection and interpretation on the researcher’s part on several levels. Interpretation suggests that there are no clear rules and that the researcher’s judgment, intuition and ability to highlight issues play an important part in the process. As a result, the issue as to how to analyse qualitative evidence is an area often poorly understood by researchers new to the interpretivist paradigm. The complexity of the data analysis process is increased due to the volume of evidence collected as part of a qualitative research study. The role of Computer Aided Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS) in supporting this data analysis process is examined in this paper. It explores how CAQDAS can be used in facilitating the management of an extensive qualitative evidence base. CAQDAS enables researchers to manage qualitative data that would prove onerous through manual “pen and paper” methods. The paper examines the author’s use of the CAQDAS package N&#8209;vivo in managing approximately 400 pages of single spaced interview transcripts resultant from a study on the evaluation of a new student ICT administrative system implementation in the Irish Institute of Technology (IoT) sector. This was an extensive empirical research study conducted across several case study sites and involved 49 informants and multiple sources of case study evidence. The objective was to develop a coherent cross&#8209;case primary narrative of the system’s implementation from the evidence collected, reduce this to a set of key findings and ultimately develop a theoretical conjecture that provided fresh insights into the ICT investment evaluation process. The N&#8209;vivo package served primarily as a support tool in managing the interview transcripts; in reflecting on the emerging themes; and in interpreting the body of evidence. It facilitated the identification of key points, the coding of key concepts that emerged from the body of evidence, and comparison between these concepts. It supported the later reclassification of concepts into a series of categories and sub categories; this helped to organise related concepts in relation to the overall research and facilitated greater understanding of the body of evidence. It supported the creation of memos to clarify emerging concepts and the categorisation of interview material to facilitate cross&#8209;case analysis. Further, it facilitated analysis through for example relationship and model exploration. These features of N&#8209;vivo played a vital role in producing a series of narrative accounts and ultimately the distillation of a new theoretical conjecture.

Uncovering Hidden Meanings, Values and Insights Through Photos

Authors:

Madeleine Ogilvie
Abstract:
Photographs have been used as a means of data capture for many years. Their use in recording observable phenomenon in anthropology is well documented. They also provide a valuable tool for researchers from other disciplines. This paper explores the use of photographs in qualitative business research. It demonstrates how the use of photographs can enrich the business research process through a range of techniques such as photo&#8209;elicitation, autodriving, projective prompts and phenomenological interviews. Drawing from a selection of the researchers’ past studies, a comparative review of the use of photographs and the benefits they bring to the data capture process is examined. These studies range from an analysis of visible face makeup, place attachment in a rural community using farmers and town respondents and international students’ perceptions of home. The photographs capture the outside image of what a respondent is sensing and experiencing inwardly, providing a prompt for the respondent to drive the interview with their own words, language and values. In all instances photographs were found to augment the quality and richness of the data captured and provide an extra depth of analysis that otherwise may not have been discovered. In addition, the paper highlights the dynamics involved in the process of using visual data capture methods. The photographs were used for respondents to engage in a free sorting task which is useful in uncovering respondents’ values and meanings when asked to explain choices made between their photographs. This is of particular use in difficult to articulate situations like face makeup self perceptions and personal attachment to the environment. Our findings suggest that photographs are an increasingly important tool to use in business research and that they enhance the breadth and insight of the qualitative research process. The procedures and value gained using photographs are outlined along with a discussion on the benefits and disadvantages of this process.

Title:
A Strategy for Delayed Research Method Selection: Deciding Between Grounded Theory and Phenomenology

Authors:
Sebastian Reiter
Abstract:
TThis paper presents a strategy for delayed research method selection in a qualitative interpretivist research. An exemplary case details how explorative interviews were designed and conducted in accordance with a paradigm prior to deciding whether to adopt grounded theory or phenomenology for data analysis. The focus here is to determine the most appropriate research strategy in this case the methodological framing to conduct research and represent findings, both of which are detailed. Research addressing current management issues requires both a flexible framework and the capability to consider the research problem from various angles, to derive tangible results for academia with immediate application to business demands. Researchers, and in particular novices, often struggle to decide on an appropriate research method suitable to address their research problem. This often applies to interpretative qualitative research where it is not always immediately clear which is the most appropriate method to use, as the research objectives shift and crystallize over time. This paper uses an exemplary case to reveal how the strategy for delayed research method selection contributes to deciding whether to adopt grounded theory or phenomenology in the initial phase of a PhD research project. In this case, semi&#8209;structured interviews were used for data generation framed in an interpretivist approach, situated in a business context. Research questions for this study were thoroughly defined and carefully framed in accordance with the research paradigm’s principles, while at the same time ensuring that the requirements of both potential research methods were met. The grounded theory and phenomenology methods were compared and contrasted to determine their suitability and whether they meet the research objectives based on a pilot study. The strategy proposed in this paper is an alternative to the more ‘traditional’ approach, which initially selects the methodological formulation, followed by data generation. In conclusion, the suggested strategy for delayed research method selection intends to help researchers identify and apply the most appropriate method to their research. This strategy is based on explorations of data generation and analysis in order to derive faithful results from the data generated.

Counting on an Iterative Process: Initial Lessons from the Research Assessment Exercise 2008

Abstract:
The aim of this paper is to present the early stages of a critical analysis of the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) 2008 which is intended to generate a model that can be of practical use in the Research Excellence Framework 2013. By drilling down into the research outputs available on the RAE 2008 website we intend to compare the context and methodologies used in more and less successful submissions. We show how an on&#8209;going study may generate results that are useful in progressing towards both discovering answers to the Research Questions and refining of the methods used. ’. The results of the RAE 2008 in the field of Business and Management may have been disappointing for a number of institutions. However, the feedback in the form of the RAE ratings is difficult to use in making improvements to performance. This paper uses Westminster Business School (WBS) a post&#8209;1992 business school, as an example, and focuses on the Research Output aspect of the RAE ratings. It shows how a comparison of a sample of submitted outputs from this business school and those of two more successful institutions is a relevant exercise which reveals some useful areas for improvement and is worth re&#8209;focusing to provide more constructive feedback. Following a precursory literature review which sets the scene of differing but often not&#8209;quite&#8209;understood statuses of the qualitative and quantitative paradigms, initial findings suggest that the RAE outputs submitted by these three business schools vary substantially in terms of indicators of prestige and features such as topic area, journal rankings and citations; indicators of resources and professional network such as number of different topics, authors and location of authors; and indicators of methodology and method. The analysis takes into account the requirements of the 2013 Research Excellence Framework (REF) in order to progress. In this way the results of the RAE may be used to assist in institutional preparations for the REF.

The use of the case study method in theory testing: the example of steel trading and electronic markets

Abstract:
Many of the research questions of interest to IS academics and practitioners concern the success or failure of change initiatives involving the introduction of new systems and practices, when the phenomenon interacts with the context, and the focus is on organisational rather than technical issues. These are exactly the types of research questions for which a case study method is well suited. This paper assesses the use of the case study method to test hypotheses and build theory while investigating the phenomenon of steel e&#8209;marketplaces. The paper draws upon the lead author’s experience when working on her doctoral thesis ‘Factors Affecting the Viability of Electronic Marketplaces: an Empirical Investigation into International Steel Trading’. Although the case research strategy has mostly been utilised for exploration and hypothesis generation, the case method is appropriate to all phases of research. In this study the research objectives were identified as theory description and theory testing, and the case strategy was used to describe and test the hypotheses. The lead author undertakes a cross&#8209;case analysis of multiple IT&#8209;powered initiatives in order to develop theoretical propositions to be tested through subsequent research. This paper discusses how issues and concerns inherent in this method were dealt with, and assesses the quality of the findings.

Research Methodology by Numbers

pp66&#8209;77
Authors:
Graham Trevor Myers
Abstract:
Research Methodology is a daunting subject for those who have to negotiate its vastness for the first time. Often the knowledge they gain is not coherent and lacks foundation. In this paper a structured system of incremental assignments given to students allows them to experience research by “doing” rather than learning vast amounts of theory. This model allows all students to grasp the process of research by doing a quantitative proposal and pilot study in seven steps. The result is the completion of a first research project which eventually culminates in a publishable paper at internal university level. From this universal foundation every discipline may expand and hone the skills learnt by students by examining the epistemology and ontology of the specific discipline. It also allows students from different disciplines to comprehend and discuss the research of other disciplines and foster inter&#8209;disciplinary research. The model has been developed for Universities of Technology in South Africa over a period of 13 years. It started off as a very theoretical set of lectures which covered as many quantitative and qualitative methodologies as could be taught, but this left students rather bewildered. The simplification of the system to cover just one quantitative method, using the relationship between two variable, or constructs, taught through assignments, self chosen mentors and an e&#8209;mail communication system has had remarkable success with high completion rates and high marks from students in large classes. Rubrics have been the main form of assessments and the final products of a proposal and pilot study, and a publishable paper have been of exceptionally high and uniform in standard.

Student Research in a Web 2 world: Learning to use new Technology to Gather Primary Data
Pages:
pp78&#8209;86
Authors:
Martin Rich
Abstract:
In recent years there has been rapid growth in the number of resources available to conduct scholarly research with the assistance of the Internet. While the British Library’s (2009) survey revealed a reluctance among doctoral and post&#8209;doctoral researchers to engage with new technologies, masters&#8209;level students and final&#8209;year undergraduates are often much more open to technological innovation, They are familiar with interactive tools in the classroom (King and Robinson, 2009), and used to the characteristics associated with Web 2.0 (O’Reilly, 2005), but could often benefit from guidance as to how to exploit these tools in their independent work. This paper discusses four general types of tool which can be used to gather primary data in research: Electronic web&#8209;based surveys. These can be set up very simply using software such as ‘Surveymonkey’, Qualtrics, or the Bristol Online Surveys system developed specifically for the UK higher education sector. As a result they are popular with students, but their very ease of use often means that little attention is paid to sampling, or to interpreting the results with caution. Blogs. Again, these are easy to set up, but it is less clear to students how they can be used as a data gathering tool. However the current author has encountered a number of instances where a student has set up a blog to invite comments on a topic, and to gather opinions from readers that might contribute to the students’ work. Personal response systems or ‘clickers’ which are available as a computer peripheral and can be used to gather data from a group of people very rapidly. Conferencing systems which could be used in effect to conduct more or less structured interviews electronically. A simple exchange of emails would be a primitive way of achieving this, and would be asynchronous, in that the interviewee does not need to respond instantly. A synchronous equivalent could be provided using chat or instant messaging software. All four of these have the benefit of being instantly self&#8209;documenting in that any data provided is stored electronically. This is a particularly attractive attribute for masters level students, or final year undergraduates, who may be under pressure to produce some independent and original work with very limited resources. As a general observation these tools offer enhanced scope for students to carry out original and distinctive work, and to place their own stamp on their findings. If nothing else, the use of unique primary data can differentiate one student’s work from that of others. But this needs to be tempered with an appreciation of the limitations of primary data and an understanding of how to use it realistically.

Experiences from Sequential Use of Mixed Methods
Pages:
pp87&#8209;95
Authors:
Stefan Cronholm
Abstract:
The discussion of qualitative or quantitative approaches has been going on for many years. One way to reduce the most dogmatic standings is to use mixed methods consisting of combinations of qualitative and quantitative approaches. In this paper, we have analysed usage experiences from combining qualitative and quantitative approaches in different ways. We refer to these combinations as method configurations. Our findings point out that a researcher should commence with a qualitative approach when: 1) the researcher has a lower pre&#8209;knowledge of phenomenon to be studied, 2) the phenomenon to be studied is abstract and 3) there is an uncertainty if the questions asked are the right questions. On the contrary, there is a tendency in our results that the researcher should start with a quantitative study when 1) the researcher has a good pre&#8209;knowledge of the phenomenon or 2) the phenomenon is more concrete.

Title:
Mixed Methods Research: The Five Ps Framework
Pages:
pp96&#8209;108
Authors:
Roslyn Cameron
Abstract:
Mixed methods research (MMR) is often referred to as the third methodological movement and has witnessed a rapid rise in popularity in the last 10 years. Prominent authorities in the field now refer to the MM research community which has developed its own philosophical, theoretical, methodological, analytical and practical foundations and constructs for the conduct of MMR. This paper provides a brief overview of some of the more common definitions of mixed methods research and methodology before introducing the conceptual framework of the Five Ps of mixed methods research. The Five P framework will be used to structure an exploration of some of the key challenges facing those who choose the innovative path of mixed methods research and some of the key areas for capacity building. The Five Ps include: Paradigms; Pragmatism; Praxis; Proficiency; and Publishing. This Five Ps framework will be mapped against the contemporary landscape of the MMR movement as developed by some of the most prominent mixed methodologists within the MMR community. These include: the overlapping components of an emerging map of MMR (Teddlie and Tashakkori 2010) and the domains of MMR (Creswell 2010). The Five Ps framework can provide those wishing to embark into mixed methods research with the essential components of a mixed methods starter kit, inclusive of a contemporary checklist of contentious issues, risks and traps that require consideration.  Tashakkori and Teddlie (2010b: 29) refer to the need for MM researchers to become methodological connoisseur[s] whilst Cameron (2011: 263) calls for the need to build  methodological trilingualism in those wishing to engage in MMR. Both these capacities require advanced research skill levels and competencies. As a consequence the framework also offers higher degree supervisors and educators with a pedagogic tool for guiding and teaching mixed methods.

Design Science Research: The Case of the IT Capability Maturity Framework (IT CMF)
Pages:
pp109&#8209;118
Authors:
Marian Carcary
Abstract:
Design science (DS) is a problem solving paradigm that involves building and evaluating innovative artifacts in a rigorous manner to solve complex, real world problems, make research contributions that extend the boundaries of what is already known, and communicate the results to appropriate audiences. The importance of this paradigm in the Information Systems (IS) field has been recognised since the early 1990’s with the publication of seminal articles by for example Nunamaker et al (1991), Walls et al (1992) and March and Smith (1995). However, over the past 15 years, DS research in IS has been sparse. In more recent times this has begun to change, with an increasing number of research contributions considering DS research. DS research in IS is important as the dominant behavioural science paradigm is not sufficient for addressing the types of problems that call for human creativity and innovative and novel solutions. One widely debated problem in the IS field that calls for such novel solutions centres on how organisations manage, deliver and optimise value from their IT investments. This paper presents a DS research project in the IS field that aims to improve organisational ability in managing and optimizing value realised from IT investments through increasing maturity in critical areas. This research involves development of an IT Capability Maturity Framework (IT CMF). The IT CMF project is centered at the Innovation Value Institute (IVI) at the National University of Ireland Maynooth (NUIM). The IVI is a joint venture between NUIM, Intel and the Boston Consulting Group and seeks to drive innovation in the management and use of IT in order to optimise business value. The IT CMF represents an emerging blueprint of key IT capability processes, and at a high level consists of four integrated IT management strategies or macro processes: managing IT like a business, managing the IT budget, managing the IT capability, and managing IT for business value. The IT CMF represents a blueprint for incrementally improving these four macro processes across five maturity levels: initial, basic, intermediate, advanced, and optimized. These four macro processes are further broken into 32 critical processes (CPs), which are the key activities that an IT organisation needs to manage in order to deliver IT solutions and measure the business value generated. The content development and review for the IT CMF is performed by the IVI development community, which comprises academic researchers, industry based practitioner&#8209;researchers and consultants based in over 55 global companies. This paper discusses its development in terms of key DS principles and presents reflections on the challenges and value associated with adopting a DS approach. The paper adds to the growing body of DS literature in the IS field, and enables other researchers and practitioners to judge the rigor with which the IT CMF artifact was created and evaluated, and its utility in practical application.

Title:
Incorporating Design Science Research and Critical Research Into an Introductory Business Research Methods Course
Pages:
pp119&#8209;129
Authors:
John R Venable
Abstract:
Research in business can address a variety of goals, including explanation or evaluation of extant business practices, development of new business practices, critiquing business practice, and examining business goals other than profit. Empirical research about extant business practices is conducted in one or both of the positivist and interpretive research paradigms. Development of new business practices, rather than simply examining existing ones, is conducted by research within the Design Science Research (DSR) paradigm. The DSR paradigm emphasises the invention, design, and development of new technologies, techniques, and methods, yet still achieving research rigour. Critically examining organisational practices and goals other than profit, such as business ethics, sustainability, and the triple bottom line, is much better conducted within the Critical Research (CR) paradigm, which critically examines the purpose, goals, and social and societal impacts of business and other practices. Unfortunately, the Introduction to Business Research Methods courses and textbooks that develop the business research community’s fledgling members’ ability to conduct, interpret, and critique and develop high quality research typically place heavy if not exclusive emphasis on positivist and interpretive research paradigms and methods at the expense of other research paradigms and methods. Such exclusive emphasis on positivist and interpretive research at the expense of other paradigms handicaps new researchers and severely limits their future ability to conduct, interpret, critique, and develop high quality research. To address this problem, this paper describes how DSR and CR have been successfully incorporated within an introductory business research methods course, which introduces students, regardless of their specific business discipline, to business research. The paper describes how it (1) deals with textbooks that have a limited perspective on business research paradigms and methods and (2) provides a needed, holistic perspective on business research, regardless of the specific discipline. To accomplish the above, the new course does four specific things. First, it situates business research as an applied discipline, along with other applied disciplines, such as medicine and engineering, and in contrast to non&#8209;applied disciplines, such as physics or psychology. Second, it includes a key new framework that contrasts the assumptions and perspectives of different research paradigms, including business research knowledge goals, the role of values in research, and epistemological issues. Third, it modifies and extends frameworks and figures from a popular business research methods textbook to supplement the limited perspective of the textbook with alternative research goals and paradigms. Fourth, the new course adds relevant introductory readings. The paper presents these extensions to the course, including how and where they are included within the course presentation, materials, and assessments, as a model for others wishing to enhance their introductory business research methods courses.

Demystifying the Arduous Doctoral Journey: The Eagle Vision of a Research Proposal
Pages:
pp130&#8209;140
Authors:
Rahinah Ibrahim
Abstract:
In fast&#8209;paced business organisations, there is critical need for conducting systematic research in order to explain and solve recurring problems in the industry. However, we find many building professionals losing their patience over the unknown end of a doctoral study as most of them practise problem&#8209;solving in their jobs since they were so trained. The purpose of this article is to present a visualisation tool developed by a built environment faculty to explain a typical three&#8209;year journey that mature building professionals are required to take for solving their own research inquiries. We claim that if these mature students are given a quick overview on how and what their doctoral journey would involve at the start of their studies, they will be less fearful of uncertainties and will accordingly fulfil the requirements of their doctoral studies successfully. The Eagle Research Design Table (Eagle Table) is a self&#8209;filled tool guided by three research question’s constructs. The key to expanding the Eagle Table is identifying these constructs in a research inquiry first. We have established three constructs—“WHO”, “WHAT” and “HOW”—through prolonged participatory experience in teaching research methodology to building professionals. The “WHO” construct refers to the element or subject being used in, or impacted by, the study while the “WHAT” construct refers to the body of knowledge that is required to solve the research inquiry. The final “HOW” construct refers to the action to be taken on the element or subject during the study. In this article, we present how these three research question’s constructs, when presented in a table form, proved to be successful in providing a quick overview of a doctoral study’s journey. Hence, enabling many mature building professionals to persevere in their studies. Consequently, the academic community would benefit from the rich experience and wisdom of their industry partners in handling and tackling recurring problems in the built environment.

Research Methodologies and Professional Practice: Considerations and Practicalities

Steven Chase

Abstract:
Professional doctorates have been established as key arenas for learning and research with the requirement for individuals to make both a contribution to management practise and academic knowledge. Many students on these programmes are drawn from the senior business world, for which the traditionally quantitatively focused business environment is familiar territory and, from which, we often see a natural tendency towards research that embraces the positivist approach that brings with it the familiarity of hard, measurable, results&#8209;focused business disciplines. The insight into the academic world of ontology, epistemology and the different research approaches that form part of the learning arena of the professional doctorate provides an opportunity for students to consider the qualitative research alternative and the value of this in developing professional understanding and in making a contribution to knowledge, understanding and management praxis. This paper does not seek to critique the criteria for what constitutes “good” research or to argue against positivist research in the professional research arena per se. Our position is that critical reflexive thinking has a key part to play in research in both developing the student and in closing the loop between the approach taken to carry out the research, the research findings, the contribution to academic knowledge and how the research practically informs professional practice. Reflexive exploration we contend takes us beyond simple numerical objective measures and into the field of subjective understanding, which can be unsettling for the mindset of a traditionally positivistic organisation. It can be perceived as difficult and time consuming, and offering vague or conflicting outputs and we recognise that talk of subjectivity, bias and interpretation may seriously affect the acceptability of research in this tradition amongst business people and needs careful handling. The methodology must stand up to the scrutiny of both academic and management disciplines by producing results that both these disciplines accept and understand. The rewards, we suggest, of reflexive exploration, offer the opportunity of a privileged insight into workforce behaviours and motivations that are not often articulated and recognised in the business world. Within this paper we draw upon hermeneutics and critical discourse analysis highlighting the role of critical reflexivity to illustrate how these qualitative research methodologies can be used to bring the academic and business worlds together.

Project Management Bodies of Knowledge; Conjectures and Refutations
Pages:
pp152&#8209;158
Authors:
Miles Shepherd
Roger Atkinson
Abstract:
The traditional view of a profession is that of a discipline with a distinct set of skills and knowledge that define the area of practice and characteristics of the practitioners. This nature and area of practice of a profession is sometimes defined as its body of knowledge or ‘BoK’. In the case of project management, as the discipline moves towards professional recognition, this BoK becomes a significant device that serves the needs of many stakeholders in addition to those of the practitioner or academic. The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of research in the development of project management Bodies of Knowledge. As project management emerges from the ghetto of engineering and develops its trajectory towards recognition as a profession, its knowledge area becomes even more significant because it needs to be seen to define a distinct knowledge domain that sets out the limits of the ‘profession’. However, the knowledge domain can be said to have shifted so that it is still under constant review and improvement to respond to continual change. New areas of practice have emerged, such as programme management and portfolio management, that are considered to be part of the discipline hence the knowledge area requires refinement. In this paper we show that current versions of project management BoKs are poorly served by underpinning research. We contend that evidence based research should play a part in the construction of BoKs, and that other research approaches should be also seen as relevant and effective. This paper draws on experiences of updating a formal Body of Knowledge, reviews the context of a range of project management bodies of knowledge and identifies a number of issues concerning the nature of project management knowledge and how it can be represented. We conclude that BoKs serve a valid purpose but conflicting priorities affect the development process and undermine their usefulness. From the epistemological issues identified, we add our conjecture that the capacity of bodies of knowledge to represent the broader understanding of the discipline is limited.. The paper concludes with a review of some methodological implications of the interaction of stakeholder interests and BoK development practice.

Deciding on the Scale Granularity of Response Categories of Likert type Scales: The Case of a 21&#8209;Point Scale
Pages:
pp159&#8209;171
Authors:
Noel Pearse
Abstract:
This research investigates the use of a 21&#8209;point Likert type scale in the design of a questionnaire that explores factors related to staff turnover and retention. The paper examines the notion of granularity in researcher&#8209;defined fixed rating scales, where granularity refers to the number of response categories or cut off points that are imposed on a scale (Smithson 2006). The aim of this research paper is to examine the usefulness of a scale with high granularity, from the perspectives of respondents and the researcher. The questionnaire was administered among employees in three different public sector organisations in South Africa, to create a combined data set of 178 respondents. Informing the formulation of the hypotheses was Parducci’s (1965 cited in Tourangeau, Rips & Rasinski 2000) range&#8209;frequency model, which assumes that respondents make use of the various response categories available with equal frequency, if they are evenly spaced. It was therefore hypothesised that (1) there are no significant differences in the frequency of use of the 21 response categories, implying that all of the response categories are useful to respondents; (2) that there would be no difference in the response pattern of respondents when different scale types and lengths are used, implying that increasing the scale granularity did not lead to redundancy; and (3) that there are no significant differences in the variation of responses with ongoing use of the scale. That is, if the scale was useful to respondents, they would continue to use a wide range of the response options available. Chi&#8209;square tests were primarily used to test the hypotheses. It was concluded that the 21&#8209;point scale was useful to respondents and by implication to researchers as well. This was evident in the spread of responses across the 21 response categories of the scale, and that even with prolonged use, they continued to utilise a wide range of response options. It was recommended that researchers should give more explicit attention to scale granularity when designing a questionnaire and that further research is required to assess the value of various levels of scale granularity.

Abstract:
Qualitative research routinely requires experienced practitioners in a given field to be interviewed, and there are a range of methods known to elicit dialogue. The method for elicitation presented in this paper, however, goes a stage further it seeks not only to elicit dialogue but to provide subjects with additional knowledge, which they are encouraged to use as a lens for reflection on their own experience. Using a progressive series of related information graphics, accompanied by explanations, subjects are quickly taught a new topic and are asked to reflect on their own practice while the learning occurs. The research project is described to contextualise the elicitation method within the wider engagement. The approach was tested with a number of Information Technology (I.T.) specialists, each with extensive experience of encouraging users to participate in new I.T. environments. Subjects were provided with information graphics that incrementally increased their understanding of psychological theories related to attitude change, namely cognitive dissonance and the elaboration likelihood model. As their knowledge increased, they were guided to reflect on occasions where they had encountered phenomena related to such psychological theory, its effect and affiliated best practice. Over all, this approach was effective, with over 130,000 words of relevant, advanced discourse forthcoming. In this paper, the elicitation method, its affiliated epistemology, an overview of the project and the research methodology are presented, along with some early results.

Title:
Researching Sustainable Development of the Rural Poor in India

Authors:

Abstract:
This paper examines the methodology undertaken by one PhD researcher in a rural Indian context. The research built an in&#8209;depth understanding of how to deliver an improvement in the sustainable development of local rural Indian villages. The sustainable development projects are developed and implemented by Non&#8209;Governmental Organisations (NGOs) but are part funded through the corporate responsibility programme of a multi national Bank. The research focused on the processes used in the projects, how they were implemented and the outcomes achieved. The research is unusual in management research, in that it takes a stakeholder perspective rather than the more customary corporate perspective. Consequently the focus is on understanding the processes, implementation and outcomes from the perspective of three groups of stakeholders. The three groups are the Bank, the NGOs and the villagers who are the end recipients of the projects. This paper does not explore the outcomes of this research but rather describes the research methodology undertaken to effectively execute the research. The research methodology chosen was that of case study with an interpretivist stance. Whilst case study can be an umbrella term for multiple data collection tools, there was a focus on collecting data via discussion and observation, in line with the interpretivist paradigm. To achieve the required level of discussion and observation was facilitated by undertaking an ethnographically&#8209;styled approach. This ethnographic&#8209;styled approach included the researcher spending time living in the Indian villages with respondents to understand the outcomes of the sustainable development projects which had been undertaken from their perspective. The data gathering processes include structured, semi&#8209;structured and in&#8209;depth interviews across the three primary stakeholder groups of respondents. Other data gathering included observation, documentation, artefacts, video and photographs. In summary this paper provides an insight into a method for undertaking research in a local rural developing country context. It particularly focuses on taking a stakeholder perspective to corporate interventions in a community, rather than the more usual company focused approach. It further contributes to the development of appropriate methodology for contexts where the researcher is from a different cultural and linguistic background to the respondents.

Book Review: The Mixed Methods Reader edited by Clark and Creswell

Abstract:
The Mixed Methods Reader edited by Clark and Creswell, Sage 2008, ISBN 978&#8209;1&#8209;4129&#8209;5145&#8209;6 is an exceptional book and should be required reading for anyone who is interested in undertaking academic research using a mixed methods approach. Mixed methods to which an increasing number of academic researchers are resorting is generally poorly understood and few of those who claim to use it are competent. In many cases mixed methods is seen as a refuge where those who refuse to take part in the methodological wars can shelter. In some cases the academic researcher will collect some qualitative and some quantitative data and process these independently of one another and then will claim to have used a mixed methods framework. When this is done, the claim is usually made that the researcher has used two different lenses through which to examine the research question and that this is what mixed methods is about.Whilst it cannot be said that the approach of resorting to both quantitative and qualitative data is in any way valueless a more informed and integrated framework for the use of mixed methods makes the research more powerful.Clark and Creswell provide an excellent overview of a number of important papers in the subject. They trace the need for mixed methods and they contextualise this approach and provide an accessible way of understanding its role and how it functions.The book contains 23 papers and addresses most of the important issues which any researcher needs to come to terms with if he or she is to be a successful practitioner of mixed methods. The book is divided into two parts, the first of which is titled Methodological Selections and addresses the essential topics within the mixed methods domain. The second part, titled Exemplar Research Studies, addresses the different types of mixed methods design. The Methodological Selections take on some of the philosophical issues related to Mixed Methods. In particular, I found the discussion on Pragmatism as a Philosophical Foundation for Mixed Methods and The Transformative&#8209;Emancipatory Perspective as a Philosophical Foundation for Mixed Methods interesting. The paper on Advanced Mixed Methods Research Design is particularly useful. In the Exemplar Research Studies section papers on triangulation and on experimental design are especially interesting.In general the book is accessible and there is an extensive index.The book is available at the usual bookshops.I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone wishing to become a competent Mixed Methods Researcher.

Book Review: Writing a Research Proposal – Practical guidelines for business students
Pages:
pp197&#8209;197

Dan Remenyi
Abstract:
The new textbook Writing a Research Proposal – Practical guidelines for business students by Professor Pumela Msweli published by Juta ISBN 978&#8209;0&#8209;70218&#8209;877&#8209;0  is a professionally produced easy to access guide to a very important aspect of academic research. The research proposal is the first step in any important research project. It is the research proposal which sets the agenda for the research, indicates its feasibility and most of all it demonstrates the researcher’s ability to undertake the work required. It is therefore most important that a competent research proposal is developed.This short book which is only 120 pages is a good guide to the work involved when developing the research proposal. It is designed for the novice to have with him or herself during the early days of their research while they are finding their feet. Over the 8 Chapters the author addresses all the important issues in an easy to understand way. Another important aspect of the book is that many of the key concepts and terms which are used in academic research are explained. Useful diagrams and tables are supplied.The issue of research language is an important one. Many novice researchers find it very difficult to get started because they do not know the terms which are used by researchers. Novices stumble over issues like deduction and induction and non sequitur are explained. However a Glossary of terms would be a helpful addition to the next edition of this book.Books by their nature have a target readership and this one is written for the novice researcher in the business studies field. Books also have a pre&#8209;determined scope and depth and this book is written as a starter&#8209;book which is really needed and no doubt this book will be a great success. When considering a master degree more depth may be required even at MBA and MBL level. Perhaps the book would be fully adequate for those undertaking honours level research.Finally publishers are always optimistic about the utility of their books and on the back cover it is suggested that Research Proposal – Practical guidelines for business students would be of use to doctoral students. It is true that even doctoral students have to start somewhere but I would say that a doctoral degree candidate would need to move on to more detailed texts rather soon.

The Use of Narratives to Reveal the Secret Data of Organisational Life
Pages:
pp1&#8209;8
Authors:
Andrew Armitage
Alan Thornton
Abstract:
This paper considers the use of narrative exchanges in the form of letters and conversations as a legitimate research method when collecting “secret data” within organisational settings.  It refers to narrative exchanges the authors’ undertook over a three&#8209;month period, regarding their different perspectives on their University Staff Appraisal System.  It explores personal tensions and anxieties that reside within the “secret data” of organisational life. It also reveals a concern regarding “professional commitments” with colleagues and the “managerial” edicts that dominate their work environment. From a “critical management” perspective, the paper initially provides an overview of the postmodern position and its impact upon organisational power relationships and knowledge, as individuals strive to attain and gain their authentic, personal voice within the domination of modernistic organisations. It then explains the methodological approach used for the narrative exchanges and describes the context and relationship of the two colleagues. Commencing from a discussion of organisational policy and postmodernist critiques the conversations increasingly developed into a dialogical meditation on the relationship between “self” and “other”. These narratives revealed, through their autographical, autobiographical and at times surreal discourses, messages that are often absent from conventional research data. The paper concludes with a perspective regarding critical management in which individual values, dignity, honesty and respect are upheld. Thus, narrative exchanges of this kind allow dialogical conversations in which statements are agreed, accepted, challenged or sometimes synthesised to be used as a means to explore and collect legitimate “secret data” of organisational life within an environment that respects the ethical and value systems of the participants engaged in narrative exchanges.

Abstract:
The article depicts a mixed methodology case which uses a qualitative&#8209;quantitative&#8209;qualitative approach. The research described used qualitative work with expert interviews for data collection, a quantitative analysis of the interviews and then a qualitative method of final scenario development for analysing and presenting the results. The case is offered to demonstrate that the introduction of the quantitative step of a cross&#8209;impact&#8209;analysis, which gives a mixed methodology, was beneficial for the overall research leading to surprising results that could not have been achieved with only a qualitative approach. Having a quantitative analysis step in&#8209;between, which demonstrated the most frequent and consistent results out of a wide range of overall possibilities, helped reduce researcher bias, thereby increasing the credibility of the findings. The paper concludes that judiciously used mixed methodology in general, and this approach in particular, will give researchers using qualitative data collection a much stronger foundation in terms of the analysis and display of data.

The Multidisciplinary Nature of Business Strategy: Suggesting a Rhizome Paradigm

Aim Deulle Luski
Abstract:
Though business strategy has long been the subject of academic interest, neither the question of the unified philosophical paradigm that govern it, nor the scientific disciplines that guide it has not yet been resolved (Mintzberg et al.1998). We argue that by adopting the rhizome paradigm to explain business strategy we can set the ground for understanding the intellectual foundation of business strategy and resolve the diverse, inconsistent or one may say complementary, definitions of business strategy. The article starts by presenting the various concepts of business strategy. It then portrays the many scientific disciplines that impinge on strategy, showing how none of them may be considered as a base for a unified paradigm. Turning to philosophy for a solution, we try first to look into the traditional western arbores cent philosophies but find that they do not give the needed framework for business strategy. The next step is to look at the rhizome philosophy as a possible paradigm. We follow with a brief description of the six principals of the rhizome, demonstrating how it does offer the necessary way to blend the influences of the various scientific disciplines on business strategy. We then explain how the rhizome paradigm serves to establish an intellectual foundation for business strategy that provides us with a rationalization for the coexistence of its many definitions. We conclude by describing the contribution of this article to the emerging discipline of business strategy as well as suggest directions for further research.

Abstract:
This paper highlights theoretical and mathematical differences between formative and reflective measurement models, in the context of academic SEM oriented research in Operations and Manufacturing Management, an area of significant current interest. It discusses problems associated with measurement model misspecification. It further illustrates, using survey data, the effects of possible misspecification on model fit parameters and path coefficients in a nomological model, using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) approach. It then proposes guidelines for the use of the PLS methodology for analyzing formative measurement models.

Looking at the Past to Enrich the Future: A Reflection on Klein and Myers’ Quality Criteria for Interpretive Research
Pages:
pp77&#8209;88
Authors:
Ana Cardoso
Isabel Ramos
Abstract:
In the last two decades, interpretive research has become more established and more popular in information systems field. The work of Klein and Myers (1999) consists of a set of principles for conducting and evaluating interpretive research, which provide fair and appropriate criteria for assessing the validity and reliability of such studies and, given the number of citations, has had a significant impact in the interpretive research literature. Our article focuses on understanding how this set of principles has informed research articles published in two of the highest&#8209;ranked information systems journals and, specifically, questions if these principles have been translated into common practices when conducting interpretive research in the field of information systems and whether authors incorporate them explicitly when they communicate the results of their research. We reviewed articles published in Management Information Systems Quarterly and Information Systems Research, collected any explicit or implicit evidence of quality criteria that informed the research, and highlighted direct or indirect reference to Klein and Myers criteria. We summarize and compare our findings in a comprehensive table, and note that, apparently, the principle of hermeneutic circle and the principle of suspicion are the most explicitly discussed in this sample. Moreover, Klein and Myers’ set of principles seem to have had a greater influence in the papers published in the period from 2002 to 2006. This study provides a reflexion about methodological rigor in interpretive research that, to our knowledge, had never been done. Thus, the findings here presented may be useful for junior researchers and doctorate level students to understand how validity and quality criteria are enacted in high&#8209;quality interpretive research and, we hope, may encourage them to build on the exemplary work of the authors we reviewed and thus to contribute to enriching the literature of qualitative research methodology in information systems field.

Generating a new Interview Method by using Sensing Technology to Assess Human Emotions

Abstract:
This study aims at generating new interview methods for obtaining more detailed information regarding human emotional factors by utilizing sensing technology. It can improve the weaknesses of qualitative research past discussions have pointed out, and develop the validity of collected data and more objective analysis of collected data in qualitative research. As the first step for a new research method, the study uses two types of sensing device which assess the emotional condition of an interviewee. The first device is ST technology, voice analysis software and a system of emotion estimation. This device using voice analysis defines what emotional condition the interviewees have. When the interviewee makes a statement, the ST technology can investigate his&#8209;her emotional condition, such as whether the interviewee stated it disappointedly, delightly, or angrily, while the conventional coding simply relies on text data. The second device is WHS&#8209;1, portable sensing device. This device investigates whether the interviewee stated certain things in a relaxed or stressed condition by measuring heart rate and analysing the condition of autonomic nerves. The study finally adopts both devices to precisely assess the interviewee’s emotional condition, and demonstrates that the two devices enable the researcher to obtain closer view of the interviewees. The study suggests that generally the two types of sensing device can play a supportive role in analysing emotional factors for interview research. While the researcher can only ascertain stressful or delightful factors based on coding analysis, using sensing devices enables the researcher to identify how stressful or joyful the interviewee is, and why they are in this state, ie. are they stressed due to anger or sorrow? It is expected to enable the researcher to more deeply consider the reason the interviewee is in a certain emotional condition, and also lead to contextual or theoretical discussion.

Research Philosophy Debates and Classifications: Students’ Dilemma
Pages:

Authors:
Marcia Mkansi
Edwin Asiamah Acheampong
Abstract:
Research philosophy classifications such as ontology, epistemology, and anxiology and their conflicting applications to the ‘quantitative&#8209;qualitative’ debates, are a major source of dilemma to research students in establishing their relevance to subjects areas and discipline. A number of studies have used different descriptions, categorisations and classifications of research paradigms and philosophies in relation to research methods with overlapping emphasis and meanings. This has not only resulted in tautological confusion of what is rooted where, and according to whom; but raises a critical question of whether these opposing views are enriching knowledge or subtly becoming toxic in the field? . This paper puts forth a student voice towards these debates and aims to provoke research advocates from their peripheral standpoint to become concerned about this subtle but deepening concern of students and their future impacts. A concerted effort in this direction should eventually result in the development of a planned, systematic framework and procedure that show some consensus to bail research students from these bewildering classifications and debates. The paper briefly reviews, discusses, and analyses these research philosophy classifications and debates and provides a mapping thereby through literature. Then, assesses how they impact on research students through case studies based on three North West Universities in the UK. Responses were elicited using structured interview questionnaires where students fall into different faculties and subject groupings for comparison purposes. Although the findings paint a grim picture of research, they are not conclusive to all UK students as the sample studied is skewed geographically. Future studies must survey the impact from other geographical locations. It is the conglomeration of these studies that will provide the ‘real’ magnitude of the impact on research students. This paper contributes to discussions on research methods and calls for a consensus in the field of research.

Eating our own Cooking: Toward a More Rigorous Design Science of Research Methods
Pages:
pp141&#8209;153
Authors:
John Venable
Richard Baskerville
Abstract:
This paper argues that Design Science is an appropriate paradigm for research into Research Methods. Research Methods (along with their tools and techniques) are purposeful artefacts, designed and created by people to achieve a specific purpose – i.e. to create new, truthful knowledge. Like other artefacts, research methods vary in their fitness to purpose, i.e. in their utility, depending on their fit and appropriate application to the particular purpose, contexts, and contingencies for which they were developed. Design Science Research aims at developing new purposeful artefacts with evidence of their utility. Applying a DSR perspective to research methods should yield increased utility in the application of research methods, better guidance in applying them and greater confidence in achieving the desired outcomes of applying them. Based on these premises, this paper reviews the basic concerns and issues in Design Science Research (using the balanced scorecard as an example purposeful artefact), then analyses the logical consequences of taking a Design Science perspective on research methods (using the Partial Least Square approach as an example research method purposeful artefact). First, it analyses the various purposes of research methods to clarify the alternative and competing design goals of research methods. Second, it analyses and characterises the types of purposeful (design) artefacts that comprise research methods. Third, it considers issues of the evaluation of research methods. Fourth and finally, it considered the development of design theories of research methods.

Finite Mixture Models in Market Segmentation: A Review and Suggestions for Best Practices

Authors:

Reinhold Decker
Abstract:
Recently, Andrews, Brusco and Currim (2010) noted that some of the hesitancy on the part of practitioners to adopt model&#8209;based (MB) methods in market segmentation (MS) may stem from an insufficient awareness of their performance relative to their non&#8209;model&#8209;based (NMB) counterparts. Comparisons of MB and NMB methods should provide business researchers with information as to precise conditions in which the former should be preferred. Moreover, finite mixture models (FMMs) have grown in their use since 2000 and, as there is no recent survey&#8209;based empirical literature examining their application, a comprehensive review of their usage in segmentation research seems to be of use. This article discusses some of the critical issues involved when using FMMs to segment markets, takes a closer look at comparison simulation studies in order to highlight conditions under which a business analyst might consider the application of an FMM approach, discusses model selection as well as validation issues and provides suggestions for best practices and potential improvements. Furthermore, it presents an empirical survey that seeks to provide an up&#8209;to&#8209;date assessment of FMM application in MS.

Since the equidistance assumption rarely is tested, the validity of parametric analyses of Likert&#8209;type data is often unclear. This paper consists of two parts where we deal with this validity problem in two different respects. In the first part, we use an experimental design to show that the perceived distance between scale points on a regular five&#8209;point Likert&#8209;type scale depends on how the verbal anchors are used. Anchors only at the end points create a relatively larger perceived distance between points near the ends of the scale than in the middle (end&#8209;of&#8209;scale effect), while anchors at all points create a larger perceived distance between points in the middle of the scale (middle&#8209;of&#8209;scale effect). Hence, Likert&#8209;type scales are generally not perceived as equidistant by subjects. In the second part of the paper, we use Monte Carlo simulations to explore how parametric methods commonly used to compare means between severalgroups perform in terms of actual significance and power when data are assumed to be equidistant even though they are not. The results show that the preferred statistical method to analyse Likert&#8209;type data depends on the nature of their nonequidistance as well as their skewness. Under middle&#8209;of&#8209;scale effect, the omnibus one&#8209;way ANOVA works best when data are relatively symmetric. However, the Kruskal&#8209;Wallis test works better when data are skewed except when sample sizes are unequal, in which case the Brown&#8209;Forsythe test is better. Under end&#8209;of&#8209;scale effect, on the other hand, the Kruskal&#8209;Wallis test should be preferred in most cases when data are at most moderately skewed. When data are heavily skewed, ANOVA works best unless when sample sizes are unequal, in which case the Brown&#8209;Forsythe test should be preferred.

Abstract:
When encountering qualitative research for the first time, one is confronted with both the number of methods and the difficulty of collecting, analysing and presenting large amounts of data.  In quantitative research, it is possible to make a clear distinction between gathering and analysing data. However, this distinction is not clear&#8209;cut in qualitative research. The objective of this paper is to provide insight for the novice researcher and the experienced researcher coming to grounded theory for the first time.  For those who already have experience in the use of the method the paper provides further much needed discussion arising out of  the method’s adoption in the IS field. In this paper the authors present a practical application and illustrate how grounded theory method was applied to an interpretive case study research. The paper discusses grounded theory method and provides guidance for the use of the method in interpretive studies.

Abstract:
People are often attracted to unique natural environments, but what makes them continually return to these locations, especially when considerable time and effort are required to get there? This paper discusses the methods and findings of a research project aimed at identifying and exploring how visitors develop an attachment to the remote Ningaloo Marine Park in north&#8209;western Australia. This Marine Park attracts a high percentage of repeat visitors (55%) and in order to determine the complex aspects contributing to this attachment, photo&#8209;elicitation was employed. Photo&#8209;elicitation is a qualitative technique where participants are asked to take photographs relating to the concept under study, and these are then used as triggers for underlying memories and feelings during a subsequent interview. For this study, participants were provided with digital cameras to take photographs of why they like visiting the Ningaloo Reef and what it was that made them return. Given this remote location and the inability to get photographs developed in reasonable timeframes, digital cameras were used instead of the disposable cameras more commonly used in this type of study. After a few days, the cameras were returned, and photographs uploaded on the researcher’s laptop computer with interviews conducted while viewing the photographs. Over a period of four weeks, during the peak visitor period, 30 participants took over 200 photographs and provided over 15 hours of interview recordings. Key aspects contributing to place attachment included the beauty of the physical environment, reef and marine based activities, social bonding with family and friends and enjoying a challenging though rewarding experience. By using a technique familiar to people on holidays, i.e. taking photographs, a method was invoked that people could engage with easily without the research impinging on their holiday experience.

Lessons from the field: Applying the Good Reporting of A Mixed Methods Study (GRAMMS) framework
Pages:
pp55&#8209;66
Authors:
Roslyn Cameron1
Abstract:
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to apply a quality framework for mixed methods studies referred to as the Good Reporting of A Mixed Methods Study (GRAMMS) framework which was developed by OCathain, Murphy & Nicholl (2008). Mixed methods research is an emerging methodological movement and one which is gaining in popularity across business and management fields. Those who have studied the use of mixed methods research in business have noted that a common criticism of mixed methods studies reported in academic journals is the lack of a justification or rationale for the use of mixed methods and how the study has integrated the data or findings from the study. The aim of this paper is to apply and therefore demonstrate what needs to be documented when reporting a mixed methods study. To do this we have applied the GRAMMS to a piece of field research already reported to a community based audience. The study utilised an exploratory mixed methods research design over three sequential phases and involved a combination of both qualitative and quantitative data combinations throughout the three phases. The research and its findings are now being prepared for academic publication through the process of applying the GRAMMS framework. We have documented this process as a means of assisting novice mixed methodologists who may be struggling with how they might report this new and emergent approach to research. The GRAMMS framework consists of six main points which address the rationale for utilising mixed methods as well as issues relating to the methodological choices attached to data collection methods, sequencing, sampling, priority of data, points of integration and data analysis techniques. The value of the paper lies firmly in the documenting of the GRAMMS application process and therefore how to best write up community based mixed methods field research for an academic outlet and audience.

Advancing Polyphonic, Multi&#8209;layered and Authentic Narrative Inquiry: Actor Sensemaking during Transformational Change
Pages:
pp67&#8209;83
Authors:
Sally Eaves
John Walton
Abstract:
Abstract: This paper foregrounds multi&#8209;layered and polyphonic narrative inquiry to elucidate an authentic representation of the intersectional sensemaking processes of organisational actors. This can afford particular value during the complex and dynamic circumstances of transformational change, as exemplified within the narrative tension of the joint venture Communications Sector Provider case examined in this study. The approach is panoptic and deeply situated within the context of understanding meaning&#8209;making. This is achieved by adopting a multiplicity of embedded, creative and integrative approaches to narrative elucidation, evaluation and articulation, supported by robust triangulation and process transparency. The original framework STRIKE &#8209; STructured Interpretation of the Knowledge Environment is demonstrated to afford particular value as a diagnostic and prescriptive observational tool, based on Wittgenstein's (2001) picture theory of meaning. With notable attention to non&#8209;somatic artefacts, STRIKE surfaces actor sensemaking and emergent narratives in situ. In addition, creative art and visualisation techniques optimise the conduits for direct participant expression, augmenting the traditional focus group method to enhance the capacity for all voices to be heard. The collocation of narrative data within context benefits authenticity and advances the production of coherent and cohesive findings.  A holistic, multi&#8209;dimensional, multi&#8209;textured and representational understanding of the problem situation emerges. This brings the criticality of human interaction with the physical as well as the social environment in order to create meaning to sharp focus.  It is through an intersection of human&#8209;material, social&#8209;technical dialogue, across physical, textual, linguistic and visual dimensions, that organisational actors maintain, recreate and reinterpret their individual and collective identity as a means to navigate and make sense of, the complex self and group challenges catalysed by transformational change.

Promoting the case for Using a Research Journal to Document and Reflect on the Research Experience
Pages:
pp84&#8209;92
Authors:
David Lamb
Abstract:
Abstract: This paper draws upon a personal research journey and makes the case for recording this experience using a research journal. tol The context for this paper is based on a study of family life and leisure, which collected data using more traditional qualitative methods, namely focus groups and interviews with pre&#8209;birth and post birth couples and leisure managers in New Zealand. The research design for this study was based on phenomenology, where the experience of the subjects being studied was significant and involved developing an understanding of the lived experiences of pre&#8209;birth and post&#8209;birth couples, where the way they acted was dependent upon their understanding and meaning of their behavior (Waters, 1994) This paper draws on the researchers own reflections recorded in a research journal, whilst undertaking this research study over a five year period. The paper discusses the meaning and importance of reflection as a way of evaluating the researchers own research journey and highlights a number of issues with reference to the validity of such data. The paper concludes by revisiting the key benefits of reflection and affirms the belief that research journals are a useful tool, which enables the researcher to record personal thoughts and observations in a systematic manner.

Abstract:
Abstract: This paper examines the distinctive features of narrative inquiry, reviews how narrative has been taken up in a range of disciplinary areas, and argues for the use of a narrative approach to the study of social processes in marketing organisation. An illustration is provided of narrative analysis of an exemplar case with the aim of surfacing tacit knowledge and drawing lessons from practice on a successful collaborative branding activity. A series of practices, including accounting, justifying and empathising are identified as important in the development of this emergent branding project.  The findings resonate with Bojes (1991) contention that being able to perform stories is an underrated yet important management skill that can assist organisation members to make sense of what is going on and to effect change.

Authors:
Leonel Tractenberg
Abstract:
Abstract: The astonishing growth of academic publications worldwide and the increasing access to online bibliographic databases of recent decades represent a challenge to researchers and professionals concerning the integration of findings on their area of expertise. As management studies multiply the importance of using new methods of qualitative research synthesis increases. New methods of qualitative synthesis have been recently developed, such as qualitative meta&#8209;synthesis and realist synthesis (or realist review). Yet, these qualitative syntheses methods remain relatively unknown by management researchers. Objectives &#8209; The purpose of this paper is to briefly present the realist synthesis method, and to show how knowledge cartography techniques and tools can be used in realist synthesis in order facilitate the process of theory building. Design/methodology &#8209; Underpinnings and method of realist synthesis are described, followed by a discussion on knowledge cartography and its applications to qualitative research. A realist synthesis on collaborative teaching serves as an illustration of how knowledge mapping tools can facilitate the realist review process. Findings  Cartographic techniques and tools can facilitate organizing and analysing studies, arranging and re&#8209;arranging concepts and, thus, can help designing theoretical frameworks in realist reviews. Originality/value  This paper can contribute to the instrumentalization of the realist review method, and to disseminate this method of research synthesis in Management Research.

Multicollinearity in Marketing Models: Notes on the Application of Ridge Trace Estimation in Structural Equation Modelling
Pages:
pp3&#8209;15
Authors:
Jenni Niemelä-Nyrhinen
Esko Leskinen
Abstract:
Abstract: Multicollinearity in Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is often overlooked by marketing scholars. This is unfortunate as multicollinearity may lead to fallacious path coefficient estimates or even bring about statistical non&#8209;significance of the parameter estimates. Previous empirical illustrations on mitigating the effects of multicollinearity are virtually non&#8209;existent in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to empirically illustrate the problem of multicollinearity in marketing models and the use of ridge trace estimation in mitigating the effects of multicollinearity in SEM, using the LISREL program. Two slightly differing ridge estimation procedures are illustrated using real data with a multicollinearity problem: Method A, in which the ridge constant is added manually to all diagonal elements of the correlation matrix of the variables in the model, and Method B, in which the ridge constant is added manually only to the diagonal elements of the correlation matrix of the exogenous and explanatory endogenous variables in the model. In evaluating suitable values of the ridge constant, the ridge trace method is used. It is concluded that ridge trace estimation is an effective way of mitigating the effects of multicollinearity in SEM. With same ridge constant values, both methods produce same point estimates of path coefficients, but Method B produces smaller standard errors of parameter estimates and larger squared multiple correlations than Method A.

The Impact of non&#8209;Equidistance on Anova and Alternative Methods
Pages:
pp16&#8209;26
Authors:
Bjorn Lantz
Abstract:
Abstract: The normality assumption behind ANOVA and other parametric methods implies not only mound shape, symmetry, and zero excess kurtosis, but also that data are equidistant. This paper uses a simulation approach to explore the impact of non&#8209;equidistance on the performance of statistical methods commonly used to compare locations across several groups. These include the one&#8209;way ANOVA and its robust alternatives, the Brown&#8209;Forsythe test, and the Welch test. We show that non&#8209;equidistance does affect these methods with respect to both significance level and power, but the impact differs between the methods. In general, the ANOVA is less sensitive to non&#8209;equidistance than the other two methods are and should therefore be the primary choice when analyzing potentially non&#8209;equidistant data.

SEM for Experimental Designs: An Information Systems Example
Pages:
pp27&#8209;40
Authors:
Saurabh Gupta
Abstract:
Abstract: IS research has matured significantly over the last three decades, leading to increasingly complex research designs as well as complex analytical techniques to analyze the data collected. Similar advances have happened in the experimental and quasi&#8209;experimental designs. Some key characteristics of these advances are: 1) use of latent variables approaches to operationalize key variables; 2) the need to understand the causal relationship between elements of the study; 3) the need to study the effects of technology as an addition to existing methods of working; and, 4) recognition that some conditions create greater change in outcomes over time. In spite of these advances in data collection and design, researchers are still confirming data collected via experiments to use ANOVA for analysis. This paper outlines an analytical technique that moves Information Systems experimental research beyond ANOVA. By combining and extending three advances in Structural Equation Modeling techniques, namely Mean and Covariance Structure analysis, Stacked Group modeling and Latent Growth modeling, the paper outlines a robust analysis technique that accommodates the above&#8209;mentioned advances in experimental design. The technique provides for an in&#8209;depth test of all model assumptions, as well as the flexibility to accommodate an increasing variety of experimental designs. A detailed example is provided to illustrate the usage of the technique in an Information Systems context. The example shows now only the accommodations needed in an information systems context, but also how this technique can be used to extract results from existing research methods that was not possible with ANOVA. The arguments presented in the paper as well as the example on how to use should provide future researchers with a guideline on how to use these techniques as well as provide a platform for how they can extend these techniques to accommodate more research method advances.

Abstract:
Abstract: There is wide agreement in the methodology community that the choice of data collection mode may affect the quality of response. In addition, the method of choice may also influence respondent behavior and feelings which may also impact the quality of data. This research examines response quality and respondent satisfaction measures compared across three data collection methods among male adolescent respondents.  Results suggest that adolescents provide improved levels for several dimensions of response quality when participating in interview&#8209;based research studies compared to text&#8209;based methods such as electronic form and paper and pencil formats.

Authors:
Veena Vohra
Abstract:
Abstract: This paper demonstrates how the complex phenomenon of contextual leadership in business organizations was studied in a unique manner by using the multiple case study design. In the current context of fast paced change, uncertainty and ambiguity, leadership roles in organizations assume great significance. Recent studies have indicated the relevance and importance of studying leadership behavior in the context in which they appear and not away from it. In this study, the multiple case study design was used for the twin purposes of capturing rich descriptive contexts of the leader and strengthening the patterns of findings using Yins (1984) replication logic.Within the case studies, mixed methods were  employed to generate qualitative and quantitative data simultaneously on the contextual leadership behaviors of senior Indian managerial leaders. The methodology,based on the social phenomenology paradigm, used interviews to capture the interpretation of the leaders about their environments. Qualitative data was collected through interviews, company documents, industry reports and analysts reports. Quantitative data collection methods included a scale based on Ansoffs model, the adaptive capacity scale as well as the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire. The study proposes a model of leadership based on rich synthesis of patterns of leadership behavior across contexts in an emerging markets scenario   using the multiple case study design, mixed methods in data collection and analysis, a combination of data driven and theory driven codes in the coding framework and mixed methods for transforming the raw dataThe objective of this study was to provide insights into designing  a multiple case study research and carrying out cross case analysis using matrices. Additionally the study describes the usage of the multiple case study design to study leadership embedded in its context in a novel manner.

Abstract:
Abstract: The appropriateness of case studies as a tool for theory testing is still a controversial issue, and discussions about the weaknesses of such research designs have previously taken precedence over those about its strengths. The purpose of the paper is to examine and revive the approach of theory testing using case studies, including the associated research goal, analysis, and generalisability. We argue that research designs for theory testing using case studies differ from theory&#8209;building case study research designs because different research projects serve different purposes and follow different research paths.

Abstract:
Abstract: Despite the fact that qualitative interviews are reputed to be an effective method of obtaining data from organizational elites, studies are concurrent on a number of obstacles which surround the interviewing of senior management. Problem areas flagged by the literature include issues of access and suspicion towards the interviewer as an outsider. This paper presents experiences with interviewing senior&#8209;level HR managers in German organizations. The author attempted to overcome some of the established barriers to interviewing internationals and organizational elites. However, as the paper argues, unique working experience collected in Germany gave the researcher insights into how to interact with senior German managers. In particular, the researcher drew on a previous role as a language trainer to create a method of engaging managers. The semi&#8209;structured interviews that followed were free from barriers and resulted in the gathering of rich data which enabled the researcher to better understand processes, networks and relationships.

Abstract:
Abstract:  An interview is a technique used by qualitative researchers to elicit facts and knowledge about the phenomenon under investigation using a series of interview questions.  Nonetheless, the establishment of conversation and negotiation of meaning during the interview process is still challenging for those who conduct interviews, no matter how skilled or experienced researchers are with the process.  It is felt in particular that researchers would benefit from the use of an instrument that, in the course of semi&#8209;structured interviews, would foster an environment where the ideas and meanings conveyed by informants could be developed and further discussed in order to achieve a deeper understanding of the phenomenon under investigation. Therefore, this paper attempts to develop and introduce decision&#8209;making maps as a new instrument to be used during the process of conducting semi&#8209;structured interviews. This newly proposed instrument is inspired by the concept and practice of perceptual mapping. The paper discusses the rationale for proposing the development and application of decision&#8209;making map in the context of semi&#8209;structured interviews, and reflects on the range of implications for the researcher, for participants, and for the practice of qualitative research that claims affiliation with constructivism.

The Long, Brown Path Before me’: Story Elicitation and Analysis in Identity Studies

pp96&#8209;106
Authors:
Ali Rostron
Abstract:
Abstract:  This paper makes a renewed case for the value of the interview as a method for investigating the workplace identities of organisational actors.  In particular it addresses interpretivist criticism that interviews merely tell us how the actor would like to be seen, rather than how they behave in practice.    Adopting a narrative approach, the method combines story elicitation with analysis based on Levi&#8209;Strauss' concept of mythical thought, in which stories are analysed to not only reveal individual self&#8209;narratives but an underpinning social landscape constructed of selected oppositions within which the individual positions themselves.  The paper illustrates the method and its potential by presenting the detailed analysis of one team leader's elicited story.  It demonstrates how the method allows not only insight into the team leader's self&#8209;identity but insight into ongoing processes of identity work, by revealing the social landscapes that they construct, the discursive resources they select, reject, challenge and struggle with, and how they position themselves in relation to those resources through narrative.  The revealed social landscape and narrative positioning also generates new insight into the particular organisational position of the team leader and the tensions inherent in their position between staff and the organisation.

Title:
The Pervasiveness and Implications of Statistical Misconceptions Among Academics with a Special Interest in Business Research Methods

Abstract:
Abstract: Statistics play a very important role in business research, particularly in studies that choose to use quantitative or mixed methods. Alongside statistical analysis, aspects related to research design (such as sampling, reliability and validity issues) require a good grounding in statistical concepts reinforced by careful practice to avoid potential mistakes arising from statistical misconceptions. Although quite a considerable number of published studies have focused on students⠒ faulty thinking regarding statistical concepts, little research explores the extent to which these are also held by academics who are their instructors. This empirical study addresses this by answering the following questions: First, are statistical misconceptions pervasive among academics with a special interest in business research methods? If so, second, is there an association between the pervasiveness of statistical misconceptions and the preferred research tradition (qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods)?. Data were collected via a web questionnaire from a purposive sample of academics with an expressed interest in business research methods. The questionnaire comprised 30 categorical statements (agree, disagree, don⠒t know) focusing on statistical misconceptions (and conceptions) relating to descriptive statistics, design strategies, inferential statistics and regression, and five demographic questions. We targeted a critical case purposive sample of 679 potential respondents. Although 166 consented to take part, only 80 completed the questionnaire and their responses form the basis of the statistical analysis, a response rate of 11.8 %. The study provides empirical evidence of both an absence of knowledge and a high pervasiveness of faulty notions that have infected the thinking of academics relating to both research design and the use of statistics. This is particularly so for academics who prefer quantitative methods, those preferring qualitative methods being more likely to admit that they do not know. The study argues that such lack of knowled

Title:
Using a Learning Contract to Introduce Undergraduates to Research Projects
Pages:
pp121&#8209;130
Authors:
Zelma Bone
Abstract:
Abstract: Many undergraduate Business programs aim to orient students to the research  through a single&#8209;subject focussed on research design and conceptualisation. The focus of this paper is to case study a learning contract as it guides undergraduate  students through a research project in a non&#8209;research methods subject and to determine the value of this process. The learning contract is a negotiated process between the learner and the academic supervisor. It is often the students first foray into research so the staged guidelines provide supportive training wheels and a detailed recipe to follow. The process can be challenging for both parties as it is a scaffolded assessment with close monitoring and regular feedback. The contract has three distinct stages. The contract proposal is the first step and is where the student can choose their focus for project by articulating a learning goal and justifying why this goal is important. This is followed by the second stage of the contract which includes a literature review, reflections on readings and a detailed methodology. The final component is the learning in action (describing what they did), analysis and evaluation of their findings and a reflection on their learning. The many advantages of this assessment are it can be used in a variety of situations and with a diversity of learners; puts the students into the centre of the learning process; students can choose a learning goal that is relevant to their situation; and it can stimulate deep approaches to learning. The learning contract approach to completing a research project also develops the students abilities in aspects of (mainly) qualitative research design and reflective practice. This paper draws on the authors 20 year experience of introducing students to research by using an assessment method that has gained  positive feedback, strong student performance and high student progression.

Learning Research Methods: How Personalised Should we be?

Abstract:
students. This influences a range of factors, spanning the expectations that students have of the learning environment, the styles and methods used by lecturers, the need to deliver very specialist material to students, and the type of technological infrastructure that is adopted to support learning. For example, some viewpoints suggest that electronic resources to support learning should be delivered through a â personal learning environmentâ , as distinct from the currently familiar â virtual learning environmentâ , the implication being that personalisation is built into the learning environment as a core component. For teaching research methods, a personalised approach is attractive because students can be expected to vary in what approaches to research they are likely to use in other areas of their studies. Typically students want to make clear choices about exactly what research methods they learn. Furthermore there are particular variations in the extent to which students already have some experience of conducting their own research, and in the ease with which student are likely to adapt to a research mindset where they can deal with the demands of independent inquiry. For many students research is an individual pursuit, and indeed for students on undergraduate or taught postgraduate courses which include a major project, a piece of independent research is the most significant item of individual work within their course. Therefore this paper raises the question of whether research training needs to be as personalised as research itself. If it appropriate to prepare students for a major piece of research, where they will be choosing their own research methods, through a didactic course which covers a standard range of methods? Is it &#8209; in fact &#8209; essential that students are exposed to a wide range of research methods including those that they have no intention of ever using? The need to provide a range of skills and knowledge, and the possibilities to adapt this to studentsâ  requirements, constitute only one facet of personalisation. Anot

Abstract:
Abstract: Managing large software projects through global development teams is a complex undertaking; it involves managing interdependent problems and dynamic situations that are constantly changing. The research and practice bodies of knowledge need to match that complexity if they are to provide practical solutions to the challenges facing such projects. This research investigates the interdependent influences exerted on project progress that emerge during project execution and cause schedule delay. This paper aims to demonstrate the value of integrating different research methods and techniques from the technical and social domains in order to address such complexity, in particular the utility of actor&#8209;network theory (ANT) to expose the influencing factors on project schedule delay. The research approach (Mixed method) was applied to empirical data from a global software provider, integrating quantitative analysis (project metrics) with qualitative analysis (grounded theory) and culminating in the development of an explanation model (ANT). The findings demonstrate that considerable benefit can be gained from the fuller understanding of the management dynamics during project execution provided by this approach. ANT makes researchers look at the networks of influence at play between human and nonhuman elements of the project, thus offering a richer picture of the project.

From Art for Arts Sake to Art as Means of Knowing: A Rationale for Advancing Arts&#8209;Based Methods in Research, Practice and Pedagogy

Authors:

Abstract:
Abstract: This paper advances a philosophically informed rationale for the broader, reflexive and practical application of arts&#8209;based methods to benefit research, practice and pedagogy. It addresses the complexity and diversity of learning and knowing, foregrounding a cohabitative position and recognition of a plurality of research approaches, tailored and responsive to context. Appreciation of art and aesthetic experience is situated in the everyday, underpinned by multi&#8209;layered exemplars of pragmatic visual&#8209;arts narrative inquiry undertaken in the third, creative and communications sectors. Discussion considers semi&#8209;guided use of arts&#8209;based methods as a conduit for topic engagement, reflection and intersubjective agreement; alongside observation and interpretation of organically employed approaches used by participants within daily norms. Techniques span handcrafted (drawing), digital (photography), hybrid (cartooning), performance dimensions (improvised installations) and music (metaphor and structure). The process of creation, the artefact/outcome produced and experiences of consummation are all significant, with specific reflexivity impacts. Exploring methodology and epistemology, both the ⠜doing⠀ and its interpretation are explicated to inform method selection, replication, utility, evaluation and development of cross&#8209;media skills literacy. Approaches are found engaging, accessible and empowering, with nuanced capabilities to alter relationships with phenomena, experiences and people. By building a discursive space that reduces barriers; emancipation, interaction, polyphony, letting&#8209;go and the progressive unfolding of thoughts are supported, benefiting ways of knowing, narrative (re)construction, sensory perception and capacities to act. This can also present underexplored researcher risks in respect to emotion work, self&#8209;disclosure, identity and agenda. The paper therefore elucidates complex, intricate relationships between form and content, the represented and the representation or performance, researcher and participant, and the self a

Design and Implementation of a Mixed Method Research Study in Project Management
Pages:

Dr Roslyn Cameron
Abstract:
Abstract: This article presents a mixed methodological approach in project management research and details the terms and the conditions of its design and implementation. Assuming, on the one hand, that qualitative methods allow the study of complex processes and phenomena in their idiosyncrasy, and, on the other hand that quantitative methods produce a nomothetic science based on statistical regularities (Miles, Huberman and Saldana 2013). We argue that mixed methods research allows, under certain conditions and trade&#8209;offs in the design and the implementation, the achievement of these two objectives. Mixed methods research remains underutilised in the management sciences despite the advantages in comparison to mono methods (Molina&#8209;Azorin and Cameron, 2010). This underutilization is linked to the tendency of certain discipline traditions and preferences for quantitative approaches as opposed to qualitative approaches. This opposition is also linked to the incompatibility thesis of the epistemological paradigms combined with the exclusive links between paradigms and methods. The theoretical foundations of mixed methods is relatively young and there remains many questions relative to the process of design, implementation and integration of qualitative and quantitative research to which researchers new to mixed methods may be confronted with. This article presents research which was carried out in two stages and focuses on the comprehension and the explanation of the diversity and the evolution of project manager⠒s roles. The paper discusses and demonstrates the objectives of a research strategy based on a mixed methodological approach combining qualitative and quantitative methods and specifies the type of mixed method research according to the implementation order, the degree of combination of the two methods and the relative weight of the qualitative and quantitative methods. We propose a practical application of the theory of mixed methods that can assist and inspire project management researchers in the design and the implementation of their own

Using Sequential Mixed Methods in Enterprise Policy Evaluation: A Pragmatic Design Choice?
Pages:
pp16&#8209;26
Authors:
Anthony Paul Buckley
Abstract:
Abstract: How might policy instruments contribute to indigenous firm growth and how can the effects of these instruments be evaluated at both firm and policy level? This paper illustrates how a mixed methods research design and data analysis strategy can pragmatically address the research questions outlined above. The advantages and challenges of employing quantitative research methods (what happened?) followed by confirmatory qualitative research methods (how and why did it happen?) in a multiphase sequential explanatory design is explored.  The data analysis strategy is firstly to analyse the data generated from a before and after quasi&#8209;experiment (with statistical controls), then data from the confirmatory qualitative techniques (indepth descriptive case studies) and cross&#8209;case analysis are added. The proposed research design and analysis approach is applicable to complex research settings where a study is unable, for a variety of reasons, to meet the exacting requirements of a true experimental design e.g. random assignment, establishment of counterfactuals, valid control groups etc. This sequential multiphase approach can deliver findings on the relative contribution of the myriad factors influencing a result showing whether the  policy intervention in this study made a contribution to an observed result and in what way? The findings from the Phase 1: Quasiexperiment,  Phase 2: Case studies and Phase 3: Cross&#8209;case analysis collectively demonstrates that the policy instrument evaluated in this study made a marginal contribution at best to individual firm performance. Overall the state received a negative return on its investment (despite selecting the cohort of firms to invest in). The study concludes that, in the analysis period, the salient factors influencing value creation in the firms (and conversely the barriers to firm growth) were internal to the firm.

Mixed Methods in Management Research: Implications for the Field
Pages:
pp27&#8209;35
Authors:
Pat Bazeley
Abstract:
Abstract: Mixed methods approaches to research have been widely adopted in social sciences and professional studies disciplines. Using a combination of methods is assumed to offer the promise of greater flexibility in undertaking research, of generating better supported arguments from research data, and of increased relevance to a wider circle of stakeholders, claims that are at least partially supported by evidence of higher journal citation rates for mixed than monomethod articles. A review of eighty&#8209;three articles published eight years apart in the Academy of Management Journal (AMJ) and Administrative Science Quarterly (ASQ) suggests that organizational and management researchers have been slow to adopt mixed methods approaches to research. Articles for both periods and in both journals were clearly dominated by studies that employed statistical analyses of archival, database, experimental or survey data, with little change over the period. These results reflect those found in other studies.  This review of articles raised wider issues. 1) Difficulty was experienced in classifying studies, leading to a refinement in emphasis for a definition of mixed methods. 2) Management researchers as a whole, as reflected in the style and referencing of these articles, have thorough training in the fine details of statistical methods of analysis; understanding of qualitative analysis is weaker and restricted to a few; and none appears to have any awareness of a growing literature on mixed methods, nor did any discuss the kinds of issues typically covered in qualitative and mixed methods articles in other journals. The results of this review have implications for the training of management and organization studies researchers who currently appear to have a quite limited repertoire of non&#8209;statistical methods on which to draw when undertaking research.

Considerations for Multidisciplinary, Culturally Sensitive, Mixed Methods Research

Abstract:
Abstract: Undertaking a mixed methods research study requires competencies and technical skills in both or all methods being utilised. This is made even more complex with a multi&#8209;disciplinary research team and a culturally sensitive research context that researchers need to take into account when making methodological choices around research design and data collection approaches and techniques. The paper expands on these issues whilst taking the reader through the research process and the culturally sensitive issues that the research team faced. The multidisciplinarity of the research team is described followed by the decision to use a mixed method approach. An explanatory sequential mixed methods research design (Creswell and Plano Clark 2011) was utilised which involved quantitative followed by qualitative data. Literature on culturally sensitive research approaches is presented as a forerunner to the methodological decisions made by the research team in terms of actual data collection and associated data collection instruments and processes.  The paper provides some valuable insights and techniques on methodological choices and approaches taken by a multi&#8209;disciplinary team in a culturally sensitive context. Actual empirical data from the study is therefore not presented. We utilise a mixed methods research design where the weakness of one type of data collection instrument is off set by the strengths of the other and where the skills and cultural mix of the research team is leveraged to achieve a more robust and rigorous study. The paper makes a contribution to research methodology in several ways, through providing ideas about how to best leverage the diversity from within a multidisciplinary research team, the strengths of using mixed methods as opposed to mono methods and the application of culturally sensitive techniques in both quantitative data collection and qualitative data collection.

Employing a Mixed Methods Approach to Benefit Business&#8209;IT Alignment and Levels of Maturity
Pages:
pp48&#8209;61
Authors:
Sally Eaves
Abstract:
Abstract: This paper examines the design, implementation, benefits and challenges of employing a mixed methods research approach with the aim to provide an emergent, integrative and multi&#8209;layered perspective on Business&#8209;IT alignment influences and maturity measurement. The application of mixed methods is underutilised in this domain and it is opined that it can serve to elucidate this perennial, but often elusive, core objective of senior management. It also begins to redress the predominance of quantitative studies and the frequent application of tools and techniques in isolation, not combination. The case of a leading UK Communications Service Provider in a two year period of joint venture integration provides a transformational context for examination, with a methodological focus.  It is argued that mixed methods can achieve a mutually supporting depth and breadth of coverage that is appropriate to complex and multifaceted phenomena such as Business&#8209;IT alignment and facilitates consideration of both process and outcomes. A transparently presented two phased, sequential exploratory and emergent design is adopted, with embedded integration. This is underpinned by a reflexive and intelligent&#8209;action orientated pragmatic lens. Innovative use of observation, photography, interviews, focus groups and survey data are synthesised to unfold the Business&#8209;IT alignment relationship, whilst the Strategic Alignment Maturity Model supports incremental maturity evaluation.  The approach facilitates a responsive, integrative, pluralistic and holistic evaluation of alignment and maturity measurement, moving beyond traditional snapshot techniques. It encourages reflexive, in situ surfacing of core themes and builds cumulative insight into the fluctuating impact of events, interventions and culture. The design benefits data richness, elaboration, validation, illustration and the identification of situated knowledge regarding enablers, inhibitors and interdependencies. Further, a robust and repeatable assessment of maturity can be achieved to support benchmarking and

The Influence of Casino Architecture and Structure on Problem Gambling Behaviour: An Examination using Virtual Reality Technology
Pages:
pp65&#8209;73
Authors:
Karen Finlay-Gough
Abstract:
Abstract: The results of three studies are reported which were designed to provide converging evidence of the emotion and gambling behaviour that are induced by casino settings.  Two overall macro casino designs were examined in this research: the playground design (high ceilings, spacious layout, the inclusion of elements of nature) and the gaming design (low ceilings, maze layout of machines, no extraneous décor). A conjoint study was conducted (n=275) that afforded the measurement of a number of décor variables in combination. Results confirmed that the propensity to gamble beyond planned levels and the level of restoration experienced are both higher for a playground casino than for a gaming casino; higher gambling was reported when travel distance to a casino was shorter; higher levels of restoration when a music soundtrack was played. Focus group research (n=24) provided rich descriptions of gambling settings, validating the provision of the desired overall macro designs and specific décor elements in casinos. Finally a study (n= 445) was conducted using virtual reality technology, a 360º Panoscope, which immersed participants in a casino settings varying in their overall macro design (playground versus gaming), the type of emotion (arousal versus pleasure) induced by a landing strip (entrance setting) and the inclusion of restorative  images in the gambling setting. The findings were particularly dramatic for females exposed to a playground setting: gambling by females was more conservative in a playground setting, with positively&#8209;valenced restorative images and with a pleasure&#8209;inducing landing strip. For both males and females exposed to a gaming design, at&#8209;risk gambling intentions were not influenced by landing strip and restorative image interventions.  The different pattern of results yielded for at&#8209;risk gambling intentions and restoration underscores the potential for research on casino environments to uncover less harmful design elements which have separate effects on these two variables.

Achieving a Doctorate Through Mixed Methods Research

Authors:
Caroline Stockman
Abstract:
Abstract: The journey of any doctorate is a challenging one. It constitutes a learning curve for postgraduate students towards becoming effective and fully independent academics. Through a concern for effective mentoring, the challenges of the doctoral effort have been well&#8209;documented. The particular issues a Ph.D. student may face when choosing a mixed methods design merits some further attention, however. Mixed&#8209;methods research is growing in popularity across academic domains and levels. Achieving a doctorate through a mixed methods study can be a very fruitful endeavour indeed. Excellent core handbooks, example studies and ongoing formalisation of the approach aid in delivering successful work. Yet the chosen methodological path may also bring up some specific hurdles. This paper aims to discuss some of those potential barriers as learning opportunities, and offer an initial discussion of the support systems. Specifically highlighted as potential challenges are the current trendy nature of mixed methods research, the search for optimal design, the development of skills, domain loyalties and paradigm problems, specific difficulties in publishing, isolation threat and justification needs. For Ph.D. students, an understanding of these challenges is a first step towards overcoming them, and achieving conscious competence.

Reflection&#8209;in&#8209;Addition: Using Reflective logs to Build Research into Undergraduate Projects
Pages:
pp85&#8209;93
Authors:
Martin Rich
Abstract:
Abstract: This paper explores the scope for using reflective logs as a component in final year projects taken by students on an undergraduate management course.  Students often wish to build practical experience into the final year of their degree, but they are also expected to carry out a certain amount of independent research as part of a final year.  There can be a tension between students⠒ desire for experience and the requirement for research.  The context of this is a management degree where a significant piece of independent work is regarded as a crucial component of the course, but where an unintended consequence of framing this piece of work in a way that encourages autonomy among students, is that there is some ambiguity about quite what students are expected to deliver.  An observation made by some of the markers of these projects is that it is not uncommon for them to read like good consultancy reports, which do demonstrate the students⠒ writing skills and often prepare them for their future careers, but which do not necessarily score highly against the criteria associated with a major academic piece of work. Within the author⠒s institution some thought has been given to providing alternative forms of project, and a tangible move in this direction has been to introduce an option where some students combine their project with working alongside an organisation on a practical task.  For these students an integral part of the process is the requirement that they maintain a reflective log on their work, following the principles of Schon (1983) in framing and reframing questions to elicit knowledge based on the students⠒ experience.  One interpretation of this is that the reflective log can constitute part of the primary data that the students draw on in their research. Such an approach has clear attractions for students and academic supervisors alike.  There are well defined formats which a reflective log can follow and which can foster experiential learning (Moon, 2004).  Because this type of project is based on practical activities

Abstract: This study developed a framework for qualitative inquiry and administration of social systems. It describes the mechanisms that decision&#8209;makers, such as the police detectives, military commanders, and transformative managers use in their problem solving initiatives. First, the framework was reviewed and constructed for: (1) the theory of qualitative data analysis; (2) problem solving process; and (3) the correlation matrices. Then, based on 14 Points, an extracted framework and its methodology are presented. Finally, a manifest (praxis) is introduced for the framework developed for a project in development planning. This innovative framework can be used for policy&#8209;making, qualitative data analysis, or problem solving and administration of social systems.

Appropriate Conceptualisation: The Foundation of Any Solid Quantitative Research

Authors:
David Onen
Abstract:
Abstract: This paper discusses the importance of conceptualisation in quantitative research. It explains in simple terms what conceptualisation entails, and indicates where and how the researcher should apply the techniques of conceptualisation. The paper has been prompted by the recurring challenges higher degree students and early career researchers face in enabling the readers of their research reports (dissertations or theses) to gain a common understanding of what they have written about. Problems with this have caused some dissertations or theses to be rejected for reporting on something other than what the candidate purports to have studied. In this paper, conceptualisation is examined as a multi&#8209;dimensional concept, starting with the process of forming concepts that describe the identified research problem, and proceeding to the derivation of agreed&#8209;on meanings of concepts, as well as the operationalisation of study variables, in order to avoid ambiguity and misinterpretation in a researchers work. In the paper, the author attempts to explain in some detail how misconceptionalisation can lead the researcher to err when conducting research, and the implications of this at each stage of the quantitative research process. In short, the paper demonstrates that a solid quantitative study cannot be conducted without appropriate conceptualisation. The paper may thus be used as a guide in planning and conducting quantitative studies by higher degree students and early career researchers.

Abstract:
Abstract: This paper used phenomenological constructivism to demonstrate and evaluate a mixed method approach for conducting information systems research.  It evaluated the implementation and implications of mixed methods approach as an exploratory and inductive research method.  A case study which made use of in&#8209; depth interviews was used to provide the dominant qualitative (QUAL) method.  Following this, a questionnaire survey was used to provide the results for the less dominant method which is the quantitative (QUAN) data. The mixed method approach was adopted to enhance the completeness and accuracy of the interpretation of the study.  It provided a number of recommendations for the use of mixed methods approach for IS projects.

Abstract:
Abstract: Academic standards are being assaulted by cyber criminals who have been introducing fake academic journals, which can look to the uninitiated to be publications that comply with the established standards of the academic community. This new form of cybercrime, predatory and counterfeit journals, has impacted the academic publishing landscape and has resulted in some unsuspecting academics being defrauded and having an indelible black mark on their publishing record. It is critical that the all members of academic community be made aware of these new phenomena in order to avoid being associated with them. It is also critical that universities monitor these developments and keep their staff fully informed of the developments in such criminal activities.

A Reflection on Intercept Survey Use in Thailand: Some Cultural Considerations for Transnational Studies

Abstract:
Abstract: How people respond to research surveys has been of long standing interest to investigators. In this paper, we reflect on our experiences in using the intercept survey as part of a study that examined m&#8209;payment in Thailand. The paper does not report the findings of the original m&#8209;payment study, but highlights how the cultural features of the target population were an important consideration at the survey translation, pilot testing and data collection stages. We propose that cultural features such as face&#8209;to&#8209;face interaction, the intrinsic notion of politeness (Kreng Jai) and conveying respect to potential participants (giving the Wai) as significant elements in achieving a relatively high participation rate. Survey translation occurred via moderated discussions where the cultural dimensions of collectivism and personal status (relevant in high PDI societies) were observed to influence group dynamics. In the field, the intercept survey promoted direct engagement with people (preferred amongst collectivism cultures), with respondents observed to be highly considerate of investigator needs and thus more likely to participate in the study.The papers contribution is one of highlighting the importance of considering national culture in the initial survey translation stage and later when collecting data in the field. Although a reflective piece, we believe that the findings have the potential to inform and assist researchers to improve the quality of their survey instruments and data responses in similar cultural settings.

Militating against data fabrication and falsification: A protocol of trias politica for business research
Pages:
pp72&#8209;82
Authors:
Anthony Stacey
Abstract:
Data fabrication and falsification are clear breaches of research ethics, but have been shown to be insidious factors in various research disciplines. It would be naïve to believe that data fabrication and falsification do not affect the validity and reliability of business research. It behoves all users of such research to militate against these unethical practices and ensure that they do not go undetected. This paper briefly reviews the motivations for researchers, interviewers or surveyors to falsify or fabricate research data. This is followed by a discussion of techniques in the literature for detecting such unethical and fraudulent practices. Typically, these rely on the premise that falsification or fabrication of data results in anomalies in the dataset that cannot be attributed to sampling or methodology.A number of business case studies are discussed involving subtle data anomalies that could be attributable to fabrication or falsification or data. It is demonstrated that tried and tested parametric or non&#8209;parametric statistical tests are often more than sufficient to identify these anomalies that characterise bogus data. However, data fabrication and falsification are not necessarily self&#8209;evident and it may therefore require an unconventional and innovative approach to determine the appropriate variables of analysis. Analysis of the phenomenon leads to the conclusion that data fabrication and falsification are most easily detected by carrying out analyses on apparently extraneous variables, as these would tend to be neglected by the errant interviewer or surveyor. This leads to proposing a generic approach to detecting bogus data and a corresponding protocol to militate against it.A protocol is proposed that separates the essential research functions by adopting the trias politica principle, or separation of powers, analogous to the three branches of government: the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. The protocol requires the three functions of research design plus substantive analysis, data collection, and data verification to be separated. Suggestions for presenting data analyses and research findings that will ensure greater transparency, militate against data fabrication and falsification, improve reliability, and promote research integrity are included. The paper concludes with a specific recommendation to academics, consultants, reviewers, examiners, and other users of business research to hold researchers more accountable for their validity and reliability of their research outputs.

Using World Café to Enhance Relationship&#8209;building for the Purpose of Developing Trust in Emotional Intelligence Training Environments
Pages:
pp98&#8209;110
Authors:
Lesley Gill et al
Abstract:
Every conversation or action between people involves an element of trust, particularly in workplace training environments. Personal development relies on the quality of trust relationships between trainer and learners, and between learners who experience feelings of vulnerability when dealing with issues that impact self&#8209;esteem and individual identity. Responsibility is placed on the trainer to create an environment characterised by trust so that learners feel safe, and unrestricted to embrace personal change, address challenging situations, and reflect on behaviours. Developing such an environment requires attentiveness to effective qualitative methodology. The research aim was to explore the need for relationship&#8209;building methodology such as World Café for encouraging the development of trusting relationships. The World Café followed an earlier study of 21 Emotional Intelligence (EI) trainers in New Zealand which sought to identify what variables contribute to the design of successful EI training. World Café was utilised as a relationship&#8209;building methodology for further exploring the nature of trust and for evaluating the method. This paper begins with a summary of literature on the nature of trust, then presents themes based on participants’ perspectives. Trust was firstly viewed through the lens of ‘inputs’. While offering a useful perspective, viewing trust as an output offered a practical way for training across different learning environments, organisational contexts, and differences between learners. These findings informed a new practice&#8209;based definition of trust. We also present our findings that support the need for relationship&#8209;building methods, such as World Café, for building trust during the process of EI training.

Action Research: Intertwining three exploratory processes to meet the competing demands of rigour and relevance
Pages:
pp111&#8209;124
Authors:
Gertjan Schuiling
Derk Jan Kiewiet
Abstract:
For decades, scholars have questioned whether it is possible to conduct research that is both relevant to practitioners and empirically sound. This is the very challenge faced by researchers at Dutch universities of applied sciences. In this paper we build on the findings of an action research project into the research practices of a Research Centre at a Dutch university of applied sciences. We found that action research (AR) works best when conceptualised as three intertwined processes: (1) a joint inquiry with practitioners aimed at improving their actions and reflections on their own practice; (2) a collaborative review with (representative) practitioners and management researchers aimed at conceptualising the issue and process of the joint inquiry; and (3) making a contribution to academic theory through a published paper building on theory related to the specific content and process of the inquiry. This paper will argue that this triple process structure can encompass the Lego AR project—one of the few published in a leading academic journal—as well as new conceptualisations of practice research (Goldkuhl, 2011, 2012) and meta&#8209;action research (Fletcher et al., 2010). As such it can be of value for all researchers looking to balance the competing demands of rigour and relevance.

Mixed Methods Research: Insights from Requirements Engineering

Authors:
Rozilawati Razali et al
Abstract:
Requirements engineering (RE) combines technical and human aspects in software development. It covers the process of eliciting, analysing, specifying, validating and managing the requirements of software systems. RE needs to understand the people and the context within which specific actions and decisions take place. Hence, RE research opts for qualitative research. Quantitative approach is equally important in RE research nevertheless, as some studies may need to measure certain variables and confirming existing theories. Therefore, the adoption of mixed methods is viewed as an appealing alternative to fulfil the diverse needs of RE studies. The method offers the strengths of both qualitative and quantitative approaches to understand and overcome complex RE issues. This paper highlights some insights of adopting mixed methods in RE research. The discussion is based on experience of having two qualitative and one quantitative studies and integrating two mixed methods research designs. The insights generate several tentative facts about employing mixed methods in RE research, which covering the aspects of writing and publishing, research intention and motivation as well as understanding of accompanying methods.

Making the Case for a Mixed Methods Design in a Bourdieusian Analysis of Family Firms
Pages:
pp135&#8209;146
Authors:
Udeni Salmon
Abstract:
This paper justifies a mixed methods design in a Bourdieusian analysis of SME family manufacturing firms in the UK. Despite the extensive use of Bourdieu in sociological research, there have been few attempts to apply his powerful “thinking tools” of doxa, habitus and fields (Bourdieu, 1979) to business studies. The research methodology outlined in this study adopts a fresh approach to a Bourdieusian analysis of the distinctive nature of family firms, known as “familiness” (T. M. Zellweger, Eddleston, & Kellermanns, 2010). Bourdieu used diverse research methods, including in&#8209;depth interviews, photographs and large&#8209;scale questionnaires to develop his concepts of doxa, fields and habitus. Therefore the philosophical underpinning has suggested a particular methodological design. Adopting a QUAN + QUAL approach (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011, p. 110), this paper will describe the rationale for the choice of mixed methodology, the relationship of the design to the research aim and objectives, the challenges of each research stage and the case for a mixed methods research design. The quantitative stage identifies trends and correlations between innovation and family firms in the manufacturing sector using a government&#8209;commissioned dataset. The qualitative stage is an in&#8209;depth analysis of 27 interviews with family firms. The final stage will compare and contrast the analysis from both stages to arrive at a fuller understanding of the phenomenon of “familiness”. This paper will not outline the results from the study, which will be the subject of further papers. It is intended that the contribution of this study will assist family firm researchers to design effective research approaches when exploring the complex nature of family firms. Furthermore, the

Abstract:
This paper describes the application of storytelling as a methodology in a consumer relationship context. A theoretical overview of Story as a unique narrative form is presented. The inquiry was conducted in the consumer banking sector using a blended narrative approach of storytelling and life history narratives. Research design was exploratory in nature and pursuant of an interpretivist perspective. The methodology applied Gabriel’s (2000) story classification taxonomy which categories stories based on epic, comic, tragic and romantic dimensions and follows the Beginning, Middle and End configuration (BME). Procedures used in this study are presented to serve as a guide for researchers interested in undertaking storytelling in the field of consumer and business research. We conclude that storytelling is a valuable methodology for exploring consumer relationships as it allows researchers to trace the evolution and development of the interaction by analysing the story typologies associated with each relationship phase. Finally, the paper reflects on the usefulness of this methodology in understanding and articulating consumer experiences.

Innovative Methodologies in Qualitative Research: Social Media Window for Accessing Organisational Elites for interviews

Abstract:
Reflexivity is the nature of qualitative research (Lincoln and Guba, 1985; Morgan an Smircich, 1980); implying that through reflectivity exercises researchers are able to demonstrate their research's rigour and also create a treasure trove of ideas and strategies, share the pleasures and agonies of doing qualitative research. The ever&#8209;growing body of knowledge on the strategies for accessing research participants that researchers share, evidences the gains of reflexivity (see the newly injected literature Cunliffe and Alcadipani, 2016; Blix and Wettergren, 2015; Mikecz, 2012). Well, this article does the same; it reflects on the access methodology employed for a PhD research (Maramwidze, 2015) carried out to explore the challenges faced by Foreign Direct Investors (FDI) in the South African banking sector, which involved sampling elite respondents. Similar to other researchers' views on accessing potential research participants, in this case organisational elites, the researcher faced challenges associated with gaining access; as well as the usually high cost of conducting face&#8209;to&#8209;face qualitative interviews.

Abstract:
Advances in text mining together with the widespread adoption of the Internet have opened up new possibilities for qualitative researchers in the information systems and business and management fields. Easy access to large amounts of textual material through search engines, combined with automated techniques for analysis, promise to simplify the process of qualitative research. In practice this turns out not to be so easy. We outline a design research approach for building a five stage process for low tech, low cost text mining, which includes insights from the text mining literature and an experiment with trend analysis in business intelligence. We summarise the prototype process, and discuss the many difficulties that currently stand in the way of high quality research by this route. Despite the difficulties, the combination of low cost text mining with qualitative research is a promising methodological avenue, and we specify some future paths for this area of study.

Social Physics, Crowdsourcing and Multicultural Collaborative Research Practice in the Social Sciences: E Pluribus Unum?

pp17&#8209;28
Authors:
David A.L Coldwell
Abstract:
The possibility of there being an investigator with the knowledge and ability to understand, let alone digest the data embraced by the boundaries of social scientific disciplines seems very remote. However research investigators in the human sciences might in their quest for greater validity and wider generalization in their concepts and theories, adopt a different scientific perspective in addition to its currently most prevalent hypothetico&#8209;deductive approach. The proposed approach made in the paper corresponds more to Baconian&#8209;type methods and those adopted by Darwin in his theory of evolution and involves the use of large data sets of the kind made available by the methodological approaches of social physics and crowdsourcing. The paper suggests that large data sets can be analyzed effectively in multi&#8209;disciplinary, cross&#8209;cultural collaborative research contexts, and a case study illustrating a collaborative research process is described in detail to demonstrate this point. The paper maintains that through the combined utilization of scientific approaches and large data gathering techniques made available through new technologies, it may be possible to generate comprehensively valid empirical and theoretical wholes across the human sciences.

The Knowledge Café as a Research Technique

Authors:

Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to describe the application of a Knowledge Café as an academic research technique. Knowledge Cafés are a tool for sharing knowledge among those individuals who participate in the conversations it encourages. Used in a novel way to non&#8209;intrusively listen in on a group of well&#8209;experienced e&#8209;Government individuals, the Knowledge Café has provided a technique for critiquing a theoretical conjecture which has lead to its refinement. This paper describes the steps involved in this refinement process, as well as the how the transcript of the final plenary session was treated. The previous and the revised theoretical conjectures are provided and the differences addressed. The application of the Knowledge Cafés technique described here is that the major beneficiaries of this event were not the participants but the facilitators. However, participants also benefited, but the transcript of the final plenary session of the Knowledge Café was coded, analysed and used to enhance the theoretical conjecture resulting from the original research. The critical success factors for the use of a Knowledge Café in this way include finding a group of well&#8209;informed participants, the facilitator/s conducting a well&#8209;focused briefing and employing a well&#8209;experienced facilitator to manage the event. In this research, the resulting refined theoretical conjecture is a more satisfactory understanding of how e&#8209;Government operates within its organisational setting.

Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations in Praxis: Guidelines and Review

Linda Ejlskov
Abstract:
Multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) is an effective tool to handle missing data &#8209; an almost unavoidable problem in quantitative data analysis. However, despite the empirical and theoretical evidence supporting the use of MICE, researchers in the social sciences often resort to inferior approaches unnecessarily risking erroneous results. The complexity of the decision process when encountering missing data may be what is discouraging potential users from adopting the appropriate technique. In this article, we develop straightforward step&#8209;by&#8209;step graphical guidelines on how to handle missing data based on a comprehensive literature review. It is our hope that these guidelines can help improve current standards of handling missing data. The guidelines incorporate recent innovations on how to handle missing data such as random forests and predictive mean matching. Thus, the data analysts who already actively apply MICE may use it to review some of the newest developments. We demonstrate how the guidelines can be used in praxis using the statistical program R and data from the European Social Survey. We demonstrate central decisions such as variable selection and number of imputations as well as how to handle typical challenges such as skewed distributions and data transformations. These guidelines will enable a social science researcher to go through the process of handling missing data while adhering to the newest developments in the field.

Theoretical Data Collection and Data Analysis with Gerunds in a Constructivist Grounded Theory Study

Authors:

Abstract:
A constructivist grounded theory study into the experiences of coached executives was undertaken to develop theory about the coaching process. The analysis reported in this paper was undertaken in parallel with the analysis to resolve the main concern of the study; that of theorising the coaching process. The purpose of this complementary analysis was to capture adaptations of the standard processes used for data collection and data analysis that facilitated the theoretical direction taken in the research. The starting point of the process is the careful, well&#8209;researched and purposive selection of the “right” first participant, and the end point is theoretical saturation of thematic categories with all variations within the category elucidated. Selection of the first, key respondent was enabled through networking, and the interview data were in&#8209;vivo coded before being converted to gerunds using an additional intervening step in Saldana’s (2016) analytic process. This mechanism converted static descriptive codes to active process codes, enabling the extraction of implicit meanings which facilitated the emergence of theoretical propositions and linkages between codes and categories. Subsequent respondents were selected on a theoretical basis.The role of the literature in achieving theoretical saturation was facilitated by adopting a reflexive stance and incorporting sensitising consultation of scholarly sources as part of the analytic process applied to each interview transcript in turn during the theoretical sampling process. The inclusion of the literature in this way facilitated the coding of the dimensions of and variations within each category.

Towards a More Holistic Understanding of Whole Organizational Networks: Anthropological Approaches in Evolving Markets

Abstract:
As markets become increasingly complex it is more and more important that we understand their underlying market networks.  While much research has been conducted into the inter&#8209;relationships and impacts between the firm and the network, less attention has been paid to the study of the whole network itself.  Understanding the origins, structures, and potential futures of whole market networks is vital to the understanding of whole markets.  This is particularly the case in light of the multiplicity of societal and institutional conditions attached to an increasingly globalized economy.  The insertion of technology into incumbent markets such as finance or healthcare causes market and network evolutions that firms must understand if they are to navigate them safely. Traditional business research methods are, however, often locked to the firm perspective through case study approaches, or quantitative network analyses.  Despite some recent methods that take a more situated, biographical approach, a bird’s eye view of the whole network remains elusive. Anthropological methods offer assistance &#8209; both in making sense of the evolution of the network within the market context, and in understanding the intricacies of such networks. Unfortunately, the concept of network analysis remains disconnected across disciplines apart from some exceptions such as Berthod, Grothe&#8209;Hammer and Sydow’s (2016) combining of social network analysis with ethnographic research methods to produce ‘Network Ethnographies.’ We build on that approach, combining market network research methods with ethnographic research methods, illustrated through case examples from our research in the connected health domain.  We illustrate ethnography’s potential for in&#8209;depth capture of network detail, showing how ethnographic methods can be used to understand each player’s position and function within that system, as well as reflecting the life and culture of the whole network.

Using Insider Action Research in the Study of Digital Entrepreneurial Processes: A Pragmatic Design Choice
Pages:
pp85&#8209;98
Authors:
Kisito Futonge Nzembayie
Abstract:
The field of entrepreneurship is yet to exhaust the gamut of qualitative design choices for use in researching the entrepreneurial process. For this reason, this paper proposes that insider action research (IAR), with its iterative, immersive and emergent form of inquiry, presents a pragmatic design choice for understanding the nature of uncertainty surrounding the digital entrepreneurial process. Since entrepreneurship in the digital context is a highly dynamic and fluid process, IAR appears well&#8209;suited for use in researching the phenomenon. Yet, the paucity of its application in entrepreneurship research, and less so in the emerging digital space, is rather puzzling. Thus, using a real time case study of a new venture creation process in the e&#8209;learning sector, this paper contributes by elucidating how this mode of inquiry might be set up and applied in digital entrepreneurship experimentation. Even though the longitudinal study at hand is still unfolding, the completion of two IAR cycles serves to demonstrate how a symbiotic interweaving of new venture creation and new knowledge production can provide the basis for extracting valuable insights about the digital entrepreneurial process.

Psychogeography – Providing a Lens on Corporate Culture and its Potential Impact on Career Success: A Novel and Efficient Approach
Pages:
pp99&#8209;108
Authors:
Dorothy Wardale
Linley Lord
Abstract:
Psychogeography refers to the loose interface between psychology and geography. Specifically it examines how we impact on the environment and the environment impacts on us. As a process it involves intimately observing the environment and seeing what may have been previously unobserved. Participants then construct meaning from these observations.   	This paper describes how we used a time&#8209;limited psychogeography approach followed immediately by a focus group as research method. The aim was to determine if examining participants’ work environment would potentially enable them to identify enablers and barriers to career success. The findings from these two short interventions are compared to the more often used semi&#8209;structured interview approach to reveal that the psychogeography provided another lens to the research. Interestingly factors that were uncovered in the psychogeography and focus groups were generally different to those identified in the interviews.  The participants were a group of high&#8209;potential academic women at a large public university in Western Australia. They were enrolled in a career and leadership development program aimed at assisting women access promotions and other senior roles leadership within the university Much of the women’s career development literature focuses on ‘fixing women’ and not the system. To that end we wanted to use a method, in addition to interview questions, to uncover aspects of the corporate environment that might impact on women’s decisions to progress their careers. We asked participants to dérive, stroll or wander within their university campus with a view to observing any ‘career enablers and barriers at work’. To not impose any further burden on their time, and to manage the wealth of data generated by the psychogeography, we asked the women to immediately share their insights through a structured focus group discussion. Participants found the psychogeography exercise a novel approach to discovering and rediscovering their work environment. The findings revealed aspects of the work environment that had not previously been overt. These included participants’ appreciation of students having fun and a carnival atmosphere within the campus yet a simultaneous concern at the lack of quiet spaces to support scholarship and research; a disparity of investment in infrastructure improvements across various schools and faculties, which led to discussions of how disparately workload was managed by different managers; staff being segregated from students and other staff with security doors;  the number of steps at the university and the impact this would have on some people with a  disability.  One pleasing and unexpected outcome of the psychogeography exercise was the level of energy and collegiality it generated. The exercise was conducted at an early stage in an eight&#8209;month career development program and its use heightened participant’s awareness of aspects of their work environment’s impact on career success that may have otherwise remained uncovered or unexamined. Our view is that psychogeography; within a limited timeframe is a valuable method to employ. When the data from such a method is captured though a focus group the impost on participant’ times is lessened, the quality of data is retained with the combined research method producing novel findings that may be different to other more traditional qualitative research methods. In our case, they helped uncover aspects of university culture and enculturation to which many research participants had been previously oblivious.

Guidelines for Researchers Using an Adapted Consensual Qualitative Research Approach in Management Research
Pages:
pp109&#8209;119
Authors:
A van den Berg
M Struwig
Abstract:
This article offers an approach to conducting qualitative research in Management Studies by providing researchers with guidelines to apply Consensual Qualitative Research (CQR). Although in the pursuit for structure, management researchers may be cautious of using qualitative research, CQR offers a structured qualitative research design option. The article explains how an adapted CQR design aligns well with most structured qualitative research methods. To describe an adapted CQR method, a research example based in Management Studies was used. This research example involved the development of a comprehensive theoretical framework that identified the various components of organisational reputation and reputation management and aimed at describing the role of social media within this framework.  The primary research design of the research example consisted of two phases. The first phase comprised of an organisational policy document analysis. The second phase consisted of qualitative in&#8209;depth, semi&#8209;structured interviews with various departmental or divisional heads aimed at enriching the data collected using document analysis of specific policy documents. In both phases, a research team was employed as well as an auditing or verification system in keeping with the CQR method, where the research team considered the data codes, data coding, analysis and interpretation throughout the research process. This article further outlines the process followed and provides coding structures, which could be adopted for other similar studies. Ten CQR guidelines are proposed, which management researchers could apply when using document analysis in Management Studies as well as three guidelines for using interview transcripts from semi&#8209;structured interviews. The CQR research process foundation was the research team approach adopted when analysing, coding and reporting on data collected. The adoption of a method such as CQR, or a modified version thereof, allows for a team of researchers to institute a process of validation to the research process and the results by thoroughly examining their own individual understandings of the data.

Delphi Method Variants in Information Systems Research: Taxonomy Development and Application
Pages:
pp120&#8209;133
Authors:
Artur Strasser
Abstract:
Delphi is a frequently used research method in the information systems (IS) field. The last fifteen years have seen many variants of the Delphi Method proposed and used in IS research. However, these variants do not seem to be properly derived; while all variants share certain characteristics, their reasoning for differentiation inconsistently varies. It seems that researchers tend to create “new” Delphi Method variants, although the underlying modification of the Delphi Method is, in fact, minor. This leads to a heterogeneity of Delphi Method variants and undermines scientific rigor when using Delphi. The study addresses this deficit and (1) identifies different variants of Delphi and determines their characteristics, (2) critically reflects to what extent a clear distinction between these variants exists, (3) shows the clearly distinguishable Delphi Method variants and their characteristics, (4) develops a proposed taxonomy of Delphi Method variants, and (5) evaluates and applies this taxonomy. The proposed taxonomy helps clearly differentiate Delphi Method variants and enhances methodological rigor when using the Delphi Method.

Title:
Alchemy Methodology &#8209; Applying the Arts to Research
Pages:
pp134&#8209;141
Authors:
Jocene Vallack
Abstract:
The difference between art and research is that, whereas art can speak for itself, research must be explained. Unlike research, art invites open interpretation from the viewers, without any need to justify or explicate its existence or the artist’s intentions. Research however, by its very nature, is a cognitive and rational product – at least in its final stages. The appreciation of postmodern perspectives in academia has given rise to methodologies for first&#8209;person inquiries and arts&#8209;based methods. Arts methods may provide the researcher with great insights into a research question, however the inquiry needs to be situated in a rational and philosophically aligned research framework. In this paper I present Alchemy Methodology as a theoretical framework for such research. It has been developed as an application of the pure phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, and it uses arts practice and subjective insights to inform and transform this data into universal, phenomenological insights. Alchemy Methodology is based on three principles:•	that the unconscious mind is far superior to logic and cognition when it comes to navigating the complex research question, but ...•	that the unconscious can only speak through images and metaphor, which ultimately must be translated through rational thought and language•	that the arts&#8209;based methods embedded in Alchemy Inquiry, can take the researcher from the most subjective reflections to the most intersubjective, universal outcomesThis paper shows how the researcher can use arts practice to inspire unconscious responses to a research question, and frame these methods in a research construction, which is rigorous and informed by pure, European Phenomenology. It takes issue with a common misconception of phenomenology in research, arguing that twentieth century modernism has skewed Husserl’s transcendental philosophy into something obscure and nonsensical.

An Original Information Systems Research Method: The Discount Focus Subgroup Method
Pages:
pp11&#8209;24
Authors:
Mohanad Halaweh
Abstract:
The aim of this paper is to present a new original qualitative research method called the Discount Focus Subgroup (DFSG) method, which originated in and was developed from information systems research. This paper synthesizes previous work on DFSG method to provide a more coherent picture of the method's applications, procedures, and strengths. It discusses why the DFSG is an innovative method and how it is distinct from the existing traditional qualitative group&#8209;based methods (e.g. focus group, brainstorming, and joint application development). The paper also provides a critical evaluation of the method by highlighting the limitations and dilemmas that a researcher might encounter when applying it and demonstrating how these pitfalls can be avoided or lessened. It finally offers directions for future research to further develop this method. This paper presents useful methodological guidelines to researchers who intend to use this method in their research projects.

The Collective Use of Forms of Language as Cultural Artefacts to Represent Public Understanding in Case&#8209;Studies
Pages:
pp25&#8209;37
Authors:
Stanley Mukasa
Terry Warburton
Abstract:
The need to demonstrate both the value of collective forms of language and the richness that interviewee reviews add to constructed analyses is a focus of debate. Researchers undertaking developmental studies have continually affirmed their commitment to demonstrate to the managers of Developmental Charities (DCs) and associated stakeholder groups not only the value a case&#8209;study approach adds to understanding but, more importantly, how better to analyse the perspectives of the different stakeholder groups regarding the management of their organisations. Here we demonstrate a methodology to help achieve this. This paper reflects on a novel case&#8209;study approach used to demonstrate the added value of constructed analyses from data provided by key informants in the construction of case studies for Oxfam GB, Water Aid, Christian Aid, Amnesty International and Action Aid. Using a wide&#8209;range of key informants to provide different insights with regards to the subject of study is an intrinsic part of the methodology. These act as the principals in adding value to data and reviewing the constructed analysis. The constructionist approach used in the development of meanings is a key methodological feature in creating a cumulative cultural text. This fits well with the key features inherent in Representation Theory that guides the choice of methodology. Four components are discussed in relation to a new proposal for case&#8209;study methodologies. These are: Key Informants, Cumulative Cultural Text, Representation Theory, Constructed Public Understanding.

e&#8209;Surveying and Respondent Behaviour: Insights from the Public Procurement Field
Pages:
pp38&#8209;53
Authors:
Anthony Flynn
Abstract:
e&#8209;Surveys have emerged as among the most widely used methods of collecting primary data from firms. In spite of their prevalence we know relatively little about how firms react to them. This paper takes a closer look at respondent behaviour during the e&#8209;survey process by analysing data from 4747 suppliers. Among the key findings are a low rate of response, fast response times and a preference for submitting responses between 08.00 and 11.00. In terms of survey completeness, respondents answered 35 of the 48 survey questions, on average, and spent approximately seven minutes doing so. The time of day at which the response was submitted and the date of response was significant in explaining survey completeness. So too was firm size and nationality. Notably, the smaller the supplier the more complete the survey response. The implications of these findings for e&#8209;surveying in the management field are discussed within.

Finding My Intuitive Researcher’s Voice Through Reflexivity: An Autoethnographic Study
Pages:
pp56&#8209;66
Authors:
Natalie Cunningham
Teresa Carmichael
Abstract:
Using autoethnography as a method and looking back to and writing about my experience (in the first person) as a relatively inexperienced researcher completing her PhD in a business school environment, I share critical moments of my research journey. The context in which I was conducting the research was a business school environment in the subject area of executive coaching. Executive coaching is a relatively new and emerging field in contrast to the many other fields in business, such as finance and economics.  We comment on the role reflexivity played in facilitating identity formation as a researcher. Reflexivity is the ability to explore, reflect on and examine social and contextual issues that impact on research. Combining reflexivity with the aim of ethnography, which is to study common and shared experiences for purposes of understanding the cultural implications of these social and contextual issues, I reflect on how the academic structure, systems and processes were an inhibitor to finding my voice. I share how reflexivity was a major contributing factor to increasing confidence in my own identity as a researcher. I examine and analyse the aspects of reflexivity that facilitated this growth in my confidence and how this experience might facilitate the same empowerment in other researchers. The paper looks at approaches to creating a reflexive culture of research drawing on Finlay’s typology of reflexivity. One example of this typology is collective reflexivity in which more than one voice is heard. This paper is co&#8209;authored with my supervisor, and her reflections are included. Collaborative reflexivity assists in addressing some of the validity concerns of only one voice. This paper will assist not only novice researchers but also the practice of research – providing a way of not just “doing” research but “being” a researcher.

Abstract:
This paper presents two respective case studies which demonstrate how visual research methods can elicit a deep understanding of the needs of potential end users and drive product and service development at a strategic business level. The engagement of users in the development of products, services and systems has been explored by a number of design disciplines in the last few decades including but not limited to product design, human&#8209;computer interaction, systems design and service design. Each has recognised the importance of understanding the humans who will potentially be using their design outcome. Notable research methods include ethnographic inspired research, in&#8209;context and lab&#8209;based observations, interviews and the user trial of prototypes. However, these approaches also have their critics and limitations ranging from the need for incremental adjustment rather than radical design, being time&#8209;consuming and costly processes, and the large volume of ‘messy data’ being collected contributing to the complexities of ‘wicked problems’. In response to some of these limitations, a number of research methods have emerged which are more arts&#8209;based in nature i.e. the act of creating allows the researcher to extract ‘deeper’ human needs (tacit and latent needs) in a drastically shorter timescale. To fully utilise such approaches it is essential that a study be designed which amalgamates diverse research methods. The two case studies presented in this paper employ a variety of traditional and generative design research methods in live commercial projects. The specific project outcomes are retained under Intellectual Property and, as such, this paper critically focuses on the value of the process and methods utilised, their relationship to the wider concept of arts&#8209;based research, and discusses issues related to their application in commercial work.

Mixed&#8209;Methods Triage: Coalescing Holistic Perspectives for a More Diverse and Inclusive Academy
Pages:
pp80&#8209;85
Authors:
B. H. Martin
Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to identify an unspoken bias embedded within the academy, and to present a new paradigm for social science research that disrupts traditional graduate school indoctrination and knowledge mobilization practices in favor of a more inclusive academy. First, I tease apart the dogmatic camp&#8209;building perpetuated by those who have learned to socialize a value for their own philosophical paradigms by discrediting others. I then suggest that research from different philosophical paradigms, but on the same phenomenon, can be presented together; and, that sense&#8209;making of such findings need not reside in the academy, but instead, in the community of readers seeking to understand a complex phenomenon. Through my own story, I share a case of systemic dysfunction within traditional academic publication that acted as a barrier to my own knowledge mobilization. This inspired an alternative approach to dissemination that I call mixed methods triage: knowledge mobilization that juxtaposes different studies on a common phenomenon, regardless of philosophical alignment, and presents them to the reader as they are without converging or making sense of the findings as a whole. I identify three tenets for this approach, and propose triage as a potential platform for a more diverse and inclusive academy. Ultimately, mixed&#8209;methods triage aligns with and expands pragmatic, mixed&#8209;methods research and contributes to the emerging trend of interdisciplinary scholarship.

Theatre as Research
Pages:
pp86&#8209;92
Authors:
Jocene Vallack
Abstract:
This paper presents a methodology called Theatre as Research. It argues that using theatre to analyse and present research findings draws on both the creative and intuitive unconscious as well as the logical, cognitive and rational dimensions of the mind. The methodology is presented in a big picture context, showing its philosophical alignment, from the overarching epistemology of Constructionism, which informs the whole approach, right down to the methods used to implement the research process. Within this context, the paper also discusses various theories that support the notion of intuition as a way of knowing. Gebser’s (1986) theory of the evolution of consciousness, along with contemporary theories of psychoanalysis and left and right brain functioning, collectively support the contention that Theatre as Research is able to draw on the powerful and creative unconscious to inform the final, cognitive analysis of the data. It is a process through which the unconscious synthesis of data to produce impressions and metaphors can then be clarified and articulated through the mindful scripting and presentation of the play.

Writing on the Walls: Poetic Transcription as a Research Conversation
Pages:
pp93&#8209;102
Authors:
Sherry Martens
Abstract:
In this paper, I explore visual displays in elementary schools as more than just pretty pictures, but thoughtful deliberations about what it means to think to see and see to think with teachers. One cannot point to a classroom/school bulletin board and say of a visual display that ‘it is this way’ or ‘it is another way’. Rather, it is through relational connections—utilizing poetry and poetic transcription to engage the multiple voices of the visual with those who inhabit classroom spaces—that one makes sense of what is occurring. It is through a practice of noticing that I, as researcher, endeavour to create and find meaning through a hermeneutic lens. As soon as I think I know what has been captured in the visual displays on the walls, it shifts, moves away, and I am drawn into another question to locate/relocate. This paper seeks to reveal the meaning of these spaces in conversations with a teacher, with and as poetry returned to one another, as a way to make sense of visual displays.

A Review of Mixed Methods, Pragmatism and Abduction Techniques
Pages:
pp103&#8209;116
Authors:
Anthony Mitchell
Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to propose that mixed methods research is complementary to traditional qualitative or quantitative research, also that pragmatism is an attractive philosophical partner for mixed methods. A key feature of mixed methods research is its methodological pluralism that can lead to superior research. The research question is whether ‘pragmatism’ as a philosophical choice to combine positivism and interpretivism can lead to an appreciation of 'what works' in practice? (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2010). The paper posits that pragmatism supports the use of different research methods and that a continuous cycle of inductive, deductive and when appropriate, abductive reasoning, produces useful knowledge and serves as a rationale for rigorous research. Firstly, the so called “paradigm wars” of quantitative or qualitative analysis are briefly reviewed; and the tenets of pragmatism are explained. A comparison is made of the different approaches and the value of applying abduction techniques to ‘surprising facts or puzzles’. Secondly, the literature regarding the ubiquity of abduction techniques is explored. Third, two recent empirical case studies in the airline and engineering sectors are summarised. Abductive thinking was key to explaining empirical phenomenon relating to competition, and in particular how leading UK and German multinationals developed rather different approaches to outsourcing. Finally, in conclusion, mixed methods were found to combine numerical and cognitive reasoning that led to a ‘best answer’ to data that otherwise could not be adequately explained. Furthermore, the application of different approaches can lead to research and subsequent management decisions that reflect both the interplay of social and scientific aspects of the world today.

A Review of Factors and Activities Contributing to Proficient Academic Business Researchers
Pages:
pp117&#8209;127
Authors:
Adrian France
Abstract:
The role of academic faculty is research, teaching, and service. In an environment that requires research, there appears to be little published discussion of the scholarly activity conducted by proficient researchers. There are few researched and published papers on researcher’s activities and habits to conduct research. The lack of research on the activities of researchers leads to the practice of research viewed as mysticism. An exhaustive search of research into the factors and scholarly activities of academic business researchers is presented in this paper to understand what researchers do to generate and produce research. The review is intended to capture current ‘best research practice’, as guidance for developing researchers who are themselves seeking to become established. A framework of factors and activities impacting on the tertiary institute researcher is developed, and journal papers are reviewed. The review indicates that researchers are influenced by daily activities, personal characteristics, career stages, and institutional environments. A number of environmental factors appear to affect productivity of researchers and personal qualities of researchers are also found to be important. Career, time allocation, and performance assessment impacts are discussed.

Title:
Exploring Complementarities of Productive IT use through Methodological Complementarism

Abstract:
Factors affecting productivity and particularly IT&#8209;enabled productivity increase have been and still remain the major concern for many business sectors. While previously researchers investigated what factors and their complementary relationships affect organizational productivity, organizational economists came to the conclusion that an organization cannot be regarded anymore as a black box since it is not an organization per se that conducts the very work but its resources with the basic elements being a single worker and a single IT system. Currently, it is proposed that we understand organizational internal mechanisms and their functioning for productivity through the lens of complementarity theory and maintain that when factors are synchronized correctly they can bring significant productivity increase. Identification of the complementarity factors and their synchronization bring, however, a major challenge for research methodology. Unlike conventional studies where a few variables independent of each other cause a reaction to dependent variables, in the context of complementarities, the assumption is closer to the real&#8209;world experiences where a set of factors interact with each other to affect one or several dependent variables. The present paper addresses this difficulty of researching complementary factors for an individual knowledge worker and their productivity. The approach taken here is to use multiple and different research methods in a complementary manner, so that the results from each study of the same kind of phenomenon uncover new insights that cannot be derived from any such single study. The results from this multi&#8209;method approach demonstrate new insights into the interplay between the studied factors that condition the productivity of knowledge workers and show the importance of analysing a complex phenomenon with complementary research methods.

Establishing Typologies for Diverging Career Paths through the Life Course: A Comparison of two Methods
Pages:

Abstract:
Discussions on policy and management initiatives to facilitate individuals throughout working careers take place without sufficient insight into how career paths are changing, how these changes are related to a modernization of life course biographies, and whether this leads to increased labour market transitions. This paper asks how new, flexible labour market patterns can best be analyzed using an empirical, quantitative approach. The data used are from the career module of the Panel Study of Belgian Households (PSBH). This module, completed by almost 4500 respondents consists of retrospective questions tracing lengthy and even entire working life histories. To establish any changes in career patterns over such extended periods of time, we compare two evolving methodologies: Optimal Matching Analysis (OMA) and Latent Class Regression Analysis (LCA). The analyses demonstrate that both methods show promising potential in discerning working life typologies and analyzing sequence trajectories. However, particularities of the methods demonstrate that not all research questions are suitable for each method. The OMA methodology is appropriate when the analysis concentrates on the labour market statuses and is well equipped to make clear and interpretable differentiations if there is relative stability in career paths during the period of observation but not if careers become less stable. Latent Class has the strength of adopting covariates in the clustering allowing for more historically connected types than the other methodology. The clustering is denser and the technique allows for more detailed model fitting controls than OMA. However, when incorporating covariates in a typology, the possibilities of using the typology in later, causal, analyses is somewhat reduced.

Researching Organisational Change in Higher Education: A Holistic Tripartite Approach

Abstract:
In the UK context, it is important to acknowledge that there are multiple change drivers in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) that result in a proliferation of foci. Gornitzka (1999) and Allen (2003) suggest that the distinctiveness of governance, professional autonomy and the tradition of academic freedom in HEIs should be reflected in change processes, and therefore traditional frameworks for change could be adapted in an attempt to research and manage change. This paper explores how theoretical and practical tools for managing and researching change can be integrated in order to support change, whilst reflecting on the methods used. The journey of the authors towards the development of a holistic framework for researching and supporting change in Higher Education (HE), with a focus on two HEIs, is explored. The synergies of Lean Management (Wincel and Krull, 2013), Appreciative Inquiry (Cooperrider and Srivastva 1987), and Participatory Action Research (Greenwood et al, 1993) are examined through three stages of practice&#8209;based fieldwork to establish their positioning within a holistic tripartite framework for researching and supporting organizational change. The benefits and challenges of this framework are discussed with attention to the importance of future research to provide more evidence of the impact of this framework.

Title:
Investigating the Social Beliefs that Attach to Indigenous Mining in New Caledonia
Pages:
pp162&#8209;171
Authors:
Peter Clutterbuck
Abstract:
Nickel mining commenced in New Caledonia in 1868 and continues to be the major business activity of that region. Traditionally the mining sector has polarized New Caledonian society via a complex mix of economic, cultural and environmental issues. In 1999 the New Caledonian and French governments initiated a future&#8209;focused program of “rééquilibrage” or rebalancing of opportunities for the New Caledonian indigenous Kanak people. “Rééquilibrage” aims to create a new identity for all New Caledonians – an identity that builds upon the multicultural mix of modern New Caledonia. A critical component of this rebalancing is the commencement of a major new world&#8209;class nickel mining venture at Koniambo (in the Kanak Northern Province) in 2014 and this venture is majority Kanak owned and operated. The literature confirms that no published review of how New Caledonians view this venture has been completed since its opening. Such a review is important because New Caledonians must vote on 4/11/2018 on the issue of independence from France. Discourses are ways of representing the world – the processes, relations and structures of the social world, that is, the thoughts, feelings, and beliefs of people. This research centres upon the contemporary social beliefs, i.e. the social discourses that circulate in relation to the Koniambo project. The investigation of these discourses must ensure that all stake&#8209;holder voices are represented accurately, that the investigation is not simply a one&#8209;dimensional “cost/benefit analysis”, and that the amplitude of the voice does not dictate its relative importance within the overall discourse ensemble. This research fits within sociology, and within this domain, the research uses the following empirical investigative approaches: actor&#8209;network theory, historiography and critical discourse analysis (for core data analysis). Actor&#8209;network theory facilitates the identification of stakeholder relationships within New Caledonian society, regardless of how subtle or transient the relationships may be. In this sense, actor&#8209;network theory produces a maximised intersection of the Koniambo project across New Caledonian social life. Historiography provides the vital context that describes the social structures and social practices in which social beliefs are formed and constantly evolve. It is not possible to fully describe these beliefs unless we have a comprehensive, longitudinal appreciation of this overall context. Finally, critical discourse analysis is utilised to unpack fully the beliefs that are identified. Discourse analysis utilises the results from the historiography and actor&#8209;network theory research components to unpack the expressed opinions and beliefs and even policies that link stakeholder entities. In this manner the project results will be most representative of the current discourses concerning a flagship project of “rééquilibrage”.

Participant Carelessness: Is It a Substantial Problem With Survey Data?

Abstract:
For decades, participant carelessness has been considered a problem in collecting data using surveys. Although participant carelessness cannot be disputed to exist, the impact it has on data quality or the level of influence or bias it produces in results is questionable. The main purpose of this paper is to determine whether participant carelessness is a substantial problem that significantly influences or biases the results of statistical analyses. This is accomplished by analyzing established management relationships through a comparison of the full, careful, and careless samples to determine the impact participant carelessness has on data results regarding correlations, t&#8209;tests, and simple linear regressions. Four detection approaches were used to identify careless participants individually, in pairs, and in three method combinations. The second purpose of this paper is to use the resampled individual reliability (RIR) approach to detect careless participants and compare it to the individual reliability approach to determine whether the two approaches are fundamentally similar. Data were collected using Mechanical Turk (N = 678). Based on the findings, participant carelessness does not appear to be a substantial problem or demonstrate levels of bias in the results in this study. There are two significant differences between the full and careful samples with the t&#8209;tests and the regression comparisons of fit statistics demonstrate the careful samples to have a weak improvement over the full sample; however, none indicate bias. The findings also suggest that the individual reliability and the RIR approaches are not entirely fundamentally similar.

The Search for Mechanisms in Business Research: Reflections on Retroductive Analysis in a Multilevel Critical Realist Case Study
Pages:
pp17&#8209;27
Authors:
Deepak Saxena
Abstract:
Many introductory research methods textbooks still divide the research paradigms into two broad approaches – positivist/quantitative/deductive and interpretive/qualitative/inductive. However, this bifurcation of research orientation does not do justice to the philosophical and methodological pluralism present within business research. This paper offers a third way by reflecting on a retroductive analysis in a critical realist case study. The philosophy of critical realism employs retroductive analysis to search for mechanisms underpinning the empirically observed events. Mechanism&#8209;based theorising is a suggested way in the business research to develop middle&#8209;range ‘sometimes true’ theories. This paper demonstrates the process of retroduction for the identification of mechanisms through an illustration of the data collection, coding and analysis process in a multilevel critical realist case study. In the process, it outlines the challenges faced and offers suggestions to overcome those challenges. This paper does not claim to provide a set of best practices for multilevel retroductive analysis. However, it is hoped that it sensitises business researchers to explore the critical realist perspective and to employ retroduction for mechanism&#8209;based theorising.

Examining Structural Flexibility Factors in SMEs: A Mixed Methods Study in Mexico
Pages:

Authors:

Cristian E. Villanueva
Abstract:
The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the utility of a mixed methods approach in the examination of one of the best&#8209;known success factors of small and medium&#8209;sized enterprises (SMEs): their structural flexibility (SF), and how this is related to their organisational life cycle (OLC). Previous research has proposed five factors to explain SF in large and medium&#8209;sized organisations. By adopting an explanatory sequential design, this study demonstrates why a mono&#8209;method approach is insufficient to explain this model when put into operation in SMEs. It also highlights a key aspect of mixed methods research: the integration challenge, which is illustrated with joint displays and using a weaving approach. In the first quantitative phase, data from 257 SMEs were collected, classified according to their OLC stage, and examined with exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and a two&#8209;step cluster analysis. The EFA revealed five factors, one of which, called “decision&#8209;making”, presented unexpected statistical behaviour and an unclear explanation, indicating a contrasting approach was necessary for better results explanation. It was not until the qualitative phase that we realised this aspect would be better named “centralisation in decision&#8209;making”. This term is associated with growing and declining SMEs, and it may constrain their flexibility and limit their growth. Additionally, a new theme emerged in this phase: “innovation”, which had not been associated with the SF before. This paper provides evidence that the combined use of quantitative and qualitative approaches offers the possibility of exploring new dimensions and can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon in a way quantitative data alone may not allow.

Improving the Pedagogy of Research Methodology through Learning Analytics
Pages:

Authors:
Ben Kei Daniel
Abstract:
Teaching research methodology is complicated because students often come from a wide range of disciplines, with different prior knowledge, diverse interests and expectations, as such, employing a pedagogical approach that appeals to all students is difficult to achieve. Subsequently, students experience many challenges when learning research methods, to the extent that courses on research methods are increasingly becoming unpopular. The current article presents the design, development and testing of iMethod; a digital learning environment for students to access various forms of online resources (e.g. text, video and audio) on research methods. iMethod tracks and captures student learning analytics, and present the teacher with a dashboard on students’ learning trajectories, to enable teachers to identify challenges students face in learning research methods. The learning analytics harvested from iMethod were used to inform the design of a pedagogical programme—analytics and research methods (ARM) that brings together a variety of workshops to support student learning. The article contributes to the growing need to improve the quality of teaching research methods courses.

Reflections on Being a Successful Academic Researcher
Pages:
pp55&#8209;66
Authors:

Dan Remenyi
Abstract:
Research is central to the life of the career academic. However, the framework in which academic research is conducted is not generally well understood and neither is it often articulated or discussed. The literature tends to rather focus on issues in relation to specific research methodologies and the evaluation thereof. Additionally, previous research argues that it is common for university academics to have little or no formal preparation for their role as teachers. This paper posits that the same applies to that of the academic’s role as a researcher. It cannot be assumed that the mere obtaining of a Doctoral degree, prepares the novice academic for a research career. Early career academics are expected to acquire an understanding of how to survive as a researcher through a process more related to osmosis than to the principles of academic discourse. This paper commences with an overview of the origins of the academic career and the doctoral degree. Thereafter, it introspects the requirements to be a successful academic researcher. Aspects of the academic researcher’s agency in relation to personal values, characteristics, integrity, research uptake skills, as well as the benefits and challenges of a research career are explored. By unpacking the salient elements of what is required to be a successful academic researcher, this paper provides a basis for those who are considering a career in academe to make an assessment if such a pursuit is feasible. In addition, the paper provides a yardstick by which early or even mid&#8209;career academic researchers may judge their progress towards being a successful researcher, thereby identifying areas for improvement.

Never Smile at a Crocodile: A bad Viva Voce by the rule book
Pages:
pp67&#8209;73
Authors:
Dan Remenyi
Abstract:
This is a narrative, the objective of which is to open a conversation about some aspects of how doctoral degrees are examined. The focus here is on a viva voce which was conducted for a mature candidate who had been registered for his doctorate for some 10 years and who came close to failing this examination.The narrative presented is a description of a viva voce examination which was conducted by the rule book and resulted in what is described here as an outcome which the degree candidate and his supervisors regarded as unfortunate. There was no misconduct on the part of anyone but some mistakes were made by the degree candidate during the examination in that the candidate did not answer well the questions put to him and the examiners did not attempt to correct him or assist him with his nervousness, which was quite apparent. As a result, the candidate’s examination performance was regarded by all to be poor. The problem which caused this unfortunate event, it is argued, lay in the lack of concentration on the part of the degree candidate and the absence of what John Maynard Keynes once referred to as the goodwill of the examiners, which was in short supply (Checkland, 1981). This narrative and the accompanying reflections reveal how delicate the viva voce process actually is and why in its current form it may need a thorough review. The paper concludes with the suggestion that the viva voce needs reform.

Sources of Research Topic Generation:  Lessons From Proficient Researchers of Business Management Disciplines

pp74&#8209;85
Authors:
Adrian France
Abstract:
Abstract: Journal publications are an output of research though there is little research into the process that led to the outcome and the lack of discussion and debate surrounding the process leads to an allure of mysticism.  This paper studies the norms of research through investigating how successful business researchers choose their research topics.  In&#8209;depth semi&#8209;structured interviews were conducted with business researchers.  Generating topic ideas by successful researchers were separated into two general sources: ‘Professional Capacity’ and ‘Individual Motivators’.  The main Professional Capacity sources were students and previous research.  These Professional Capacity sources can be used by an established researcher. The most valuable Individual Motivator is to read.  Researchers also revealed that they chose topics they found intrinsically interesting rather than topics that would necessary have a significant impact on the literature.  To achieve research and publication success, it is important to make research part of your routine and read, attend conferences, submit your work for review, and persevere.

The Delphi Method in Information Systems Research (2004&#8209;2017)

Abstract:
Abstract: After almost 30 years of being used in the information system (IS) discipline, only a few studies have focused on how IS scholars apply the method's guidelines to design Delphi studies. Thus, this paper focuses on the use of the Delphi method in IS research. To do so, articles published between 2004 and 2017 in the Senior IS Scholars' collection of journals of the Association of Information Systems (AIS), describing Delphi studies, were analised. Based on analysis of sixteen (16) retrieved IS studies, we concluded that IS researchers have applied the method’s most important phases and the procedural recommendations to promote rigor were considered in the majority of the analised studies. Nonetheless, IS researchers still need to include detailed information about (1) the steps taken to ensure the validity of the achieved results, (2) better describe the process of selecting and recruiting the experts, and (3) experiment with innovative techniques to keep participants involved in the Delphi process.

A Detailed Guide on Converting Qualitative Data into Quantitative Entrepreneurial Skills Survey Instrument
Pages:
pp102&#8209;117
Authors:
Anastacia Mamabolo
Kerrin Myres
Abstract:
Mixed&#8209;methods research designs are increasingly popular, especially in the management domain because they hold the potential to offset the weaknesses inherent in mono&#8209;method, qualitative or quantitative designs. In entrepreneurship research, the domain in which this study is located, mixed&#8209;method studies are conducted mostly according to a sequential&#8209;exploratory design with an aim of developing and validating theory in a single research study. In some studies, the qualitative phase is used to develop a questionnaire, which is more common. However, the actual process of converting qualitative data into operationalised constructs and survey items is usually not clearly articulated. This creates an opportunity to contribute to a better understanding of the process of transitioning from a qualitative to a quantitative study. This paper proposes such an approach, using an example of a study of the skills entrepreneurs use to start and run their businesses. In the qualitative phase, interviews were conducted with 20 entrepreneurs and 6 national experts to discover the skills required by entrepreneurs to start and manage their businesses. Data analysis, using computer assisted qualitative data analysis software, resulted in nine groups of skills considered important in performing entrepreneurial activities. Based on qualitative analysis, the study provides a detailed account of the process of converting qualitative data into a quantitative survey questionnaire, which will enhance the effectiveness of mixed&#8209;methods designs. The developed entrepreneurial skills questionnaire was tested and validated on a sample of 235 entrepreneurs. The article concludes with implications for mixed&#8209;methods researchers who want to develop new instruments, and scholars conducting research on entrepreneurial skills.

Authors:
Ben K. Daniel
Abstract:
Assessing the quality of qualitative research to ensure rigour in the findings is critical, especially if findings are to contribute to theory and be utilised in practice. However, teaching students concepts of rigour and how to apply them to their research is challenging. This article presents a generic framework of rigour with four critical dimensions—Trustworthiness, Auditability, Credibility and Transferability (TACT) intended to teach issues of rigour to postgraduate students and those new to qualitative research methodology. The framework enables them to explore the key dimensions necessary for assessing the rigour of qualitative research studies and checklist questions against each of the dimensions. TACT was offered through 10 workshops, attended by 64 participants. Participants positively evaluated the workshops and reported that the workshops enable them to learn the principles of qualitative research and better understanding issues of rigour. Work presented in the article is part of a large research programme investigating the pedagogy of research methods in higher education.

Addressing The Challenge of Building Research Capabilities in Business Management Undergraduate Students

Abstract:
The research process is complex, involving many conceptually different steps that require a variety of skills. For instance, early on in the research process the task of identifying and articulating a suitable research problem often involves, amongst other skills, a high level of creativity and critical thinking, whereas later on in the process, application of a suitable research method would require deep knowledge of the state of art in that methodology. As the techniques used by researchers to iterate between current discipline theory, subject knowledge and research methodology gets increasingly specialized, it is also becoming more opaque to people outside the research community. Management students with little or no exposure to research find this puzzling because they are being encouraged to do something creative and original, and at the same time they are expected to build on existing knowledge using a set of conventions associated with the chosen methodology.  Business students in their 1st year face many new situations. Most of them have little experience of what research is about or the various elements that are necessary for a successful project. The teaching at school level mostly focuses on imparting subject knowledge and instilling basic numeracy and literary skills. It does not prepare them so well for setting their own goals and working independently &#8209; the core of research. Traditional teaching methods can help them acquire the relevant subject knowledge and basic research methods. But putting these together in a piece of practical research requires in depth understanding and creative thinking. Problem&#8209;based learning (PBL) is a way to help UG students at the beginning of their research attempts to develop the mindset and skills needed. This paper makes the case for introducing Critical Thinking skills to Business Management students in their 1st year, using a problem&#8209;based Learning (PBL) approach. It assesses what was involved in developing and delivering such a course. Both staff and students found the experience challenging, but the overall response was positive establishing that the approach taken was fundamentally effective.

Title:
An Illustration of a Deductive Pattern Matching Procedure in Qualitative Leadership Research
Pages:
pp143&#8209;154
Authors:
Noel Pearse
Abstract:
Most qualitative studies in business&#8209;related research have adopted an inductive approach, in that they explore specific cases and then extract themes, or statements that are more general, from this data. This approach has its shortcomings, including not developing a more systematic body of knowledge of behavioural and social processes that take place in organisations. In contrast, in deductive qualitative research, the theoretical propositions derived from a review of the literature serve as its departure point, informing how the data is collected. Later on in the analysis of data, the researcher uses the propositions to determine if the literature explains the case that was being investigated. Unfortunately, given the relative neglect of deductive qualitative research approaches, there is little guidance and few examples offered that illustrate the application of these techniques. This poses a challenge for researchers, who often need a greater level of structure when it comes to designing and conducting their research. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to illustrate the design of a research protocol that integrates two deductive approaches that are suitable for explanatory case study research, namely deductive thematic analysis and pattern matching. This paper develops a seven&#8209;step process that researchers can follow, for carrying out this type of deductive qualitative research. Using extracts from a research study investigating the leading of organisational change, the steps in this process are illustrated.

Title:
Augmenting Social Media Research with Q Methodology: Some Guiding Principles
Pages:
pp155&#8209;164
Authors:
Charmaine du Plessis
Abstract:
This paper proposes that social media studies could be complemented with Q methodology when a topic that plays out in social media is complex, controversial or sensitive to allow for deep&#8209;seated, integrated online and off&#8209;line perspectives. Although the Fourth Industrial Revolution brought researchers more opportunities and advantages to study topics that were previously inaccessible, using technologies for research does not come without challenges. This is especially the case with social media studies comprising large datasets and where it is not always possible to identify fake profiles, bots, spam or manipulated information without having access to advanced data analysis software. Another point is that views expressed in social media do not always represent offline perspectives. However, while Q methodology has, over the years, adapted its techniques to accommodate new technologies, more can be done to embrace a web 2.0 environment. Why and how social media studies could be augmented with Q methodology to reveal individuals’ perspectives and attitudes about topics will be examined and potential difficulties will be highlighted. Not yet a mainstream method, Q methodology combines the strengths of two robust qualitative and quantitative methods sequentially to reveal and isolate the subjective perspectives of groups of participants. This methodology could, therefore, be useful when a social media study puts forward novel ideas and findings that should be supported by offline views. In this regard, the paper provides some guidelines by referring to the five phases of a Q study and describing how a social media study could not only benefit from but also apply Q methodology to augment results. Supplementing social media research with Q methodology could be empowering and provide opportunities for further research and debate.

Sequencing Effects in the Analysis of Complex Experiments in Business Research: Mechanisms, Biases, and Recommendations
Pages:
pp165&#8209;178
Authors:
Peter Kotzian
Abstract:
Experiments in business research became more complex over time, yielding complex sequences of stimuli and measurements. This raises the issue of sequence effects, where effects are found only in specific sequences of the experiment. One case in point is factorial surveys. Here, presenting the stimulus is followed by asking subjects to evaluate several vignettes presented in a certain sequence. The researcher is interested in the effect of the stimulus on responses to vignettes with certain features. As sequence and stimulus can be made uncorrelated by construction, holding the sequence constant or excluding the sequence from the analysis seems to be justified when researchers are only interested in effects of vignette features or the stimulus. In both cases, even if the sequence is relevant for the dependent variable, correlation between sequence and stimulus, the necessary condition for an omitted variable bias, is absent. The effect estimated for the stimulus should thus be unbiased. We show that even in the case where stimulus and sequence are uncorrelated or the sequence is held constant, an omitted variable bias occurs when the effect of the stimulus in a vignette is in its magnitude dependent on the sequence in which the vignettes were presented. Such an effect would be modeled by including a sequence&#8209;stimulus&#8209;interaction term and the omitted variable is this interaction term, which is, by construction, always correlated with each of the constitutive variables. A simulation is presented to illustrate the problem. Implications for experimental research are discussed.

Business Research Methodologies and the need for Economies of Scale in the Business Research Process: Harnessing the Innovation Opportunities of Novel Technologies and Technological Change
Pages:
pp179&#8209;190
Authors:
Chris William Callaghan
Abstract:
Theory and evidence suggests that returns to research and research and development are currently declining. This paper seeks to identify patterns in the use of business research methodologies in certain of the latest articles published at the forefront of the field of business research innovation, from its leading journal. This literature is used to identify the current front line of business research methodologies at the forefront of the field. Propositions are derived from novel theory, and are critically juxtaposed against identified topics and methodologies in these articles. In so doing, the conceptual distance of the front line of empirical research in the field from the radical front line of theory in the broader field is quantified. Methodological implications are discussed and recommendations are made for the development of a future research agenda.

Title:
A Model for Improving Knowledge Generation in Design Science Research through Reflective Practice
Pages:
pp192&#8209;211
Authors:
J.T. Janse van Rensburg
Roelien Goede
Abstract:
Epistemology refers to the philosophy of knowledge and aims to address central questions of how we create new knowledge. All research paradigms can be distinguished in terms of epistemological assumptions, that is, assumptions of how knowledge is produced in the respective paradigms. Design science research (DSR) is a research paradigm often used in technical disciplines for the creation of artefacts. DSR has roots in pragmatism, where beliefs and theories are evaluated based on the success of its practical application. New knowledge is produced in DSR when original artefacts are created to solve a problem. The epistemological assumption of DSR can then shortly be defined as ‘knowledge through making’. At its core, DSR is goal&#8209;orientated and its practical approaches are focused on delivering the product according to straight&#8209;forward processes &#8209; without being affected by human factors.  This process of acquiring new knowledge is efficient but not necessarily effective in terms of capturing all aspects of the experience of the practitioner. Frameworks exist for the creation of artefacts in DSR, but the process of knowledge generation is not explicit. The aim of the paper is to guide explicit knowledge generation in DSR. The research question is “How can we make the process of obtaining knowledge in DSR more explicit?” DSR Frameworks are iterative in nature and focus on the creation and evaluation of artefacts. There is an implicit assumption that reflection takes place in these iterations. Schön, author of The Reflective Practitioner, writes that new knowledge is produced through reflection during and after an event has occurred. He also states that you can only have a complete understanding of a problem through the dual process of reflection&#8209;in&#8209;action and reflection&#8209;on&#8209;action. We argue that this also holds true for artefact design and development in DSR. A reflective DSR practitioner can explicitly indicate how knowledge is produced in the design science research cycle. The effective use of reflective practice changes each individual phase of a DSR framework from goal&#8209;orientated to problem&#8209;orientated. Epistemologically, knowledge is then produced through ‘learning by doing’, which gives DSR a worldview that supports reflective practice. The paper promotes the incorporation of reflective practice in DSR and provides a demonstration thereof in an example on the preparation of IT students for their chosen career.

Activity Theory used as an Analytical Lens for Business Research

Abstract:
Activity Theory is used in this paper to demonstrate the process of critical analysis of qualitative data from two case studies. The paper explains the elements of an activity system (the subject, object, outcome, mediating tools, rules, community and division of labour). Thereafter, practical examples from the work of two recent PhD students are used to show the importance of identifying and analysing activities that are found either in the introduction or the current use of information systems in business organisations.  These examples highlight the applicability of Activity Theory in analysing data from projects of interest to Business Management whose topics and contexts are very different. The first focusses on the introduction of an Accounting Information System to microbusinesses in a low&#8209;income community in South Africa and the second focusses on Information Security Management in Mobile Network Organisations in Uganda. The examples illustrate the value of Activity Theory as a lens and as a way of stimulating critical analysis. Activity Theory is known for its ability to identify reasons for failure or disappointing performance in existing situations by highlighting contradictions either between different activities, between an earlier version of an activity and a later version as the activity evolves, or  within an activity (between the elements of that activity). However, as shown in the first example, it can also be seen as a useful tool when proposing a new project as a predictor of success. Despite the fact that data is typically qualitative, the analytical process related to Activity Theory can be structured, which assists novice researchers or those unaccustomed to interpretivist analysis to uncover insights that are not immediately obvious. Activity Theory is said to act as a lens in data analysis and is particularly useful in organisational sciences for the theorization of technology&#8209;mediated organizational change.

Abstract:
Many argue that technology brought about by the Fourth Industrial Revolution offers new opportunities for student learning. In order for educators to use technology with wisdom, in&#8209;depth longitudinal research using rigorous methodological approaches is needed to understand the opportunities and challenges of including these technologies in management education.  Therefore, educational researchers are challenged to design research projects to collect data from multiple sites over several years using various methodologies. This article examines strategies used by the researchers to design and implement a research project employing a Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach that combined qualitative and quantitative data from two universities across several years. The research project was specifically designed to study learning using a business simulation.  The article describes the research project including the various data collection points and analysis methods. The purpose of this article is to bridge the theory&#8209;implementation gap enabling educational researchers to consider the design of a comprehensive research project as well as identifying key challenges and practical suggestions for using PAR.

Title:
Let the Data Speak: Using Rigour to Extract Vitality from Qualitative Data
Pages:
pp1&#8209;15
Authors:
Alistair J Campbell
Abstract:
Qualitative data can be gathered from an array of rich sources of research information. One of the popular ways to collect this data is by interviewing a range of experts on the topic, followed by transcription, resulting in a database of written documents, often supplemented by other documented data that informs the topic. Thematic or Content Analysis can then be used to explore the data and identify themes of meaning that enlighten the research topic, with the themes being gathered into nodes. The researcher now has an array of nodes, which needs to be organised into a coherent model, and more importantly, one that represents the views of the research informants. To do this with some degree of rigour, the researcher needs some way of ranking the nodes in terms of their relative importance. The node ranking can be based on experience, or on the literature, but neither of these approaches looks to the data itself. If the database contains new or unexpected knowledge, neither experience nor the literature will guide us to it, and vital new insights may easily be missed. The framework outlined in this paper aims to provide a sound first&#8209;cut analysis of the data, based on the evidence in the research interviews themselves. Clearly the literature and research experience have an important role to play in shaping the results of any research. However this paper argues that one should proceed only after the data itself has been offered "the first chance to speak".The node classification matrix detailed here, identifies distinct node categories, each ranging in significance and with particular characteristics that reveal key aspects of the informants' views. In this way the researcher can use the nodes to reveal the voice of the experts, and build a scientifically rigorous set of results from a qualitative database.

Abstract:
Unlike reflective measurement scales, the steps for development of formative measurement scales tend to behighly subjective and involve mostly the judgment of the researcher. Formative scales have been criticized for this reason.This paper extends Christophersen and Konradt’s (2008) method of joint development of a formative and reflective scale toassess mutual validity of each scale. We utilize a second order method to reduce measurement error in the formative scaleas suggested by Edwards (2011), and test the efficacy of Generalized Structured Component Analysis (GeSCA) for thispurpose. For illustrative purposes, we utilize a sample of formative and reflective job satisfaction survey data both to testour joint formative/reflective scale development technique and to assess which formative aspects of job satisfaction alignwith commonly used reflective job satisfaction scales.

Deconstruction of a Multi&#8209;Embedded Supply Chain Coordination Problem Using Mixed Methods

pp27&#8209;43
Authors:
Oluka Pross Nagitta
Marcia Mkansi
Abstract:
It is without doubt that there are many overviews of mixed methods research in supply chain management. However, there is relatively little research and representation on the application of robust methodological approaches and techniques that take into account the dynamic nature of a multi&#8209;embedded and specialised medicine supply chain coordination (SCC) problem. In Uganda, the distribution of artemisinin&#8209;based combination therapies (ACTs) involves a multi&#8209;embedded supply chain that runs across the macro, market, and micro levels of stakeholders. The multi&#8209;embedded levels have created a coordination challenge tied to stock&#8209;outs and unavailability of ACTs to the detriment of the patients. This study aimed to: 1) demonstrate how a mixed methods approach facilitated a better understanding of a multi&#8209;embedded and specialised supply chain coordination problem, and 2) reveal the major factors for coordinating a multi&#8209;embedded supply chain that can improve the availability of ACTs in the general hospitals of Uganda. An exploratory sequential mixed method approach was employed to disentangle the problem. In the first phase, focus group discussions were predominantly used to collect qualitative data, the findings of which acted as the foundation for the quantitative survey questionnaire. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis was used to determine and validate the market and macro supply chain dimensions that emerged from the survey results. The results showed that the most influential supply chain market environment dimensions that affect the availability of ACTs include information sharing with external stakeholders and supply chain interdependence. The results from the macro&#8209;environment showed that the socio&#8209;cultural, economic, technological, and legal dimensions influence the availability of ACTs. The contribution of this paper advances the use of mixed methods in deconstructing a complex embedded supply chain problem with implications for supply chain academics and practitioners and government bodies.

Reimagining Academic Writing in Academia 4.0 to De&#8209;incentivise Plagiarism
Pages:
pp44&#8209;55
Authors:
Anthony Stacey
Abstract:
Academic research and scientific publication are being influenced irreversibly by what is referred to as the fourth industrial revolution. The exponential growth in the number of research publications continues, information and communication technology (including artificial intelligence) is making available research data and tools with unprecedented capabilities, and online open access to publications has enabled greater and more rapid access by other researchers. Changes of research practice and the behaviour of researchers and authors as a result of these developments are evident, and are challenging the criteria, norms and standards by which the quality and integrity of research has historically been judged. The manner in which prior research is being accessed, reproduced, applied and acknowledged is an example of such changes. In academia, the presentation of the ideas or writings of another without them being explicitly attributed to the original source has always been regarded as plagiarism and considered serious misconduct. Yet when such ideas and writings are freely available and in the public domain, they arguably fulfil the criteria for being considered common knowledge which don’t necessarily need to be referenced. This article presents examples of acceptable replication and reuse of the work of others, and examples of how plagiarism is manifesting differently because of information and communication technologies, including plagiarism software. It is argued that while paraphrasing previous authors result from understanding and applying their prior research, paraphrasing may simply be a grammatical or mechanistic process that does not attest understanding and application. It is provocatively suggested that current norms and standards of academic writing, including referencing, may no longer be appropriate. Relatively modest amendments to academic conventions and assumptions are proposed that could lead to a new paradigm of more efficient research and scientific publications, acknowledging that this would place greater burden of responsibility on the users, reviewers, editors and examiners of research to be familiar with extant knowledge.

Abstract:
Researchers using survey&#8209;based methods must do everything they can to enhance their response rates in order toimprove the robustness and validity of the data they collect for analysis. Extant literature has explored several techniques todo this across many contexts, including experiments/meta&#8209;analyses. This paper addresses two particular deficits byconsidering the difficult context of micro&#8209;firms and also the impact of trade&#8209;association endorsement (rather thansponsorship). This is done by conducting an in&#8209;depth ex&#8209;post review of a single, successful survey case conducted and utilisedin a study of English tourism firms and regulation. We explore several factors: the type of trade&#8209;association support (includinglevels of endorsement, access to member firms, and messages sent on behalf of the research team); postal versus onlinequestionnaires; message type/frequency; and the importance of giving respondents an opportunity for open comments. Thepaper ends with a comprehensive set of suggestions for future researchers.

Assessment of Conventional and Advanced Methodologies: Application of Configurational Approach and Fuzzy Set Theory in Emotional Labor Research
Pages:
pp72&#8209;83
Authors:
Saman Javed
Noshaba Batool
Abstract:
Application of configurational approach and fuzzy set theory on social and behavioral science variable models needs more attention. Few social science researches have employed configurational methods of research to empirically investigate a research question. On the front of exploring unique and innovative ways of investigation, this paper discusses the application of fuzzy set theory in social sciences. The study primarily takes a model of emotional labor and employee well&#8209;being as a case example to depict how configurational models are developed. The study examines emotional labor and well&#8209;being, not as predictor or criterion variables, but rather as conditions and outcome. The study also distinguishes between correlational and configurational method of research and adopts a descriptive approach by taking five research papers that examine social and behavioral science constructs from a configurational approach. Scarcity of literature in the crossover between the mathematical models and social sciences, particularly for the respective variables, call for a study that can clarify the initial queries surrounding fuzzy set models and pave the way for future empirical studies. The research concludes that utilizing mathematical models like fuzzy set theory, configuration and qualitative comparative analysis in social sciences can break monotony and bring newness in approaching as well as addressing a research query. This paper draws attention towards exploring new avenues in research methodologies. Application of newer methods would not only increase the rigor and precision of research findings but also assist in approaching a research area from multiple angles thereby enhancing the research quality.

Pedagogy and Evaluation: The Challenge for Business and Management Degree Courses in the 21st Century
Pages:
pp84&#8209;99
Authors:

Abstract:
The twenty first century has been a period of major change for business organisations and industries. This has led to an ever greater interest in and demand for managers with not only the traditional subject knowledge and technical skills but also individual business skills. To meet these demands business schools are under pressure to adapt their courses appropriately and to innovate. For an undergraduate degree in business management, this includes both the structure of the degree, the subjects covered, the teaching methods used and the whole student learning experience. But innovation poses a major challenge for researchers and teachers alike – how can the effect of an innovation be measured or assessed? This paper assesses the current state of evaluation methods applied in Business Schools. Student feedback has emerged as the dominant approach, but application is still at a fairly basic level.  A case example of evaluating the new first year redesign of the business management degree at City’s Business School is used to illustrate the practical issues involved.  Student feedback offers some indication of the success of the redesigned degree, but it does not entail any constructive dialogue between students and lecturers, and students often lack the skills to frame feedback constructively.   The paper discusses the implications of changes in the business context for the evaluation methods used in Business Schools.

Business School Teaching of Research Methods – A Review of Literature and Initial Data Collection for Undergraduate Business School Students

pp100&#8209;114
Authors:
Anthony Mitchell

Abstract:
This paper reviews approaches to teaching research methods and the effectiveness of the student supervisor relationship in managing research projects. Corporate scandal, changes in society, the emergence of online technologies and a need to reduce teaching costs have all led business schools to change their curriculum including how research methods are taught and undergraduate and postgraduate projects supervised. Management research, and the manner in which research methods are both taught and practiced continue to make a key contribution and play a significant role in the partnership between academia and practice. Virtual learning has been helpful in a better understanding of research methods, developing critical thinking and understanding issues in more depth that are briefly covered in class. Researchers have found that the blending learning approach and use of computer&#8209;mediated discourse supported a collaborative learning approach and resulted in more active and reflective learners (Altinay and Paraskevas, 2007). Despite this positive example, the use of technology for learning has generally been limited to supplementing face to face learning (Thomas and Thomas, 2012). The class is increasingly culturally diverse, students more mobile while academics may be Anglo&#8209;centric and westernised. Supervision needs to be responsive to the changing needs and ambitions of the student; to move away from a dyadic relationship between supervisor and student, and emphasise the importance of collaborative learning environments and collective models of supervision (Malfroy, 2005). Literature reviewing three related research questions is presented. Questions remain as to whether changes are driven by a need to reduce cost or improve pedagogy. Data collection has started with undergraduate business students through pilot surveys and interviews to gain an improved understanding of the trends, initiatives and best practice. A further paper will explore in more detail postgraduate business students. At a time when some schools are moving more content on&#8209;line and seeking new forms of assessment so there is a need to ensure that management research continues to fulfil a contribution towards intellectual and practical understanding. Corona virus has made this need more urgent.

Abstract:
The paper identifies and examines different positions of an interventionist researcher, facilitating value co&#8209;creation for new technology in customer&#8209;supplier dyads. The paper answers two research questions: (1) "what kind of positions can an interventionist researcher assume in a supplier&#8209;customer dyad?" and (2) "what should an interventionist researcher consider when choosing a suitable position for her research design?" The paper reflects upon a longitudinal interventionist case study (2017&#8209;2020) focused on facilitating and evaluating the value created by new medicine&#8209;dispensing robot technology in home&#8209;care in Nordic countries. The researchers conducted interventionist research in 11 supplier&#8209;customer dyads, with multiple, evolving positions of the researcher(s). As a result, as a contribution to the existing knowledge about the role of the interventionist researchers, the paper proposes three positions that the interventionist researcher can take in an interorganizational supplier&#8209;customer dyad: an auditor, a lawyer or a mediator. The auditor investigates the interface between the supplier and the customer as an outsider. The lawyer position compromises this perceived neutrality (but not independence) for deeper access to empirical data regarding one of the organisations. Thus, the lawyer actively pursues the status of 'one of us' with either the supplier or the customer. The mediator expands the previous positions by trying to achieve a status of 'one of us' in both organisations trying to understand both sides of the same story supporting both the supplier's and customers' activities. Importantly, as an extension to the existing knowledge, the paper argues that not only can an interventionist researcher move between the etic and emic domains, but she can also move within the supplier&#8209;customer dyad under examination. Thus, when conducting research within the customer&#8209;supplier dyads (and within similarly complex contexts), the interventionist researcher needs to be aware of the existence of different positions and her actual position to the subject of interventionist study. Indeed, the interventionist researcher may choose her role, or the role may be a result of an evolutionary process. The role is 'given' by the people the interventionist researcher interacts with and, thus, not something the researcher can completely decide by herself. However, the interventionist researcher can pursue a specific role that fits her research agenda and design. In any case, the researcher needs to be honest and transparent regarding the actually taken position to avoid potential methodological pitfalls arising from complex, novel research settings.

Title:
Experience Sampling Methodology: A Systematic Review and Discussion for Organizational Research
Pages:

Abstract:
In organizational research, growing attention has been given to the dynamic nature of workplace relationships and how such dynamic processes shape key behavioural outcomes. Experience sampling methodology (ESM) brings more opportunity than any other research option to examine such fluctuations and relevant causal relationships. ESM can be described as a quantitative method which allows individuals to assess discrete evaluative states on multiple events by combining three distinct elements; person, variables and occasion. Despite its increasing prevalence and popularity, however, there has been only a few attempts to investigate the most appropriate design, measurement and analysis choices for experience sampling data. Even though ESM has been utilized in organizational research for some time, systematic investigations regarding how these issues have been addressed and how the method has been applied to specific organizational topics are limited. This study provides a systematic and critical assessment of the use of ESM in current organizational research (2010&#8209;2020) by reviewing a random sample of 50 ESM studies indexed in ISI Web of Science with the aim of identifying the current state of practice. The selected studies were analysed based on several methodological aspects including the type of ESM protocol applied, sample characteristics, data sources, specified interval and total duration of data collection, structure and properties of designated measures, analytic strategy, and the research model to be tested. Findings show that organization studies vary considerably based on how they design and implement ESM. Moreover, despite the availability of good practices, many studies fail to attain recommended standards about sample size, data collection procedures, data characteristics and measurement quality. As such, this paper offers several insights regarding how time&#8209;based within&#8209;person frameworks can be improved in future studies to account for dynamic organizational phenomena.

Title:
A Reflection on SSM as a Critical Social Action Research Method: Towards Improvement of Project Governance
Pages:
pp142&#8209;152
Authors:
Carin Venter
Abstract:
Academic research is often regarded as less than helpful for practice, while knowledge practitioners are accused of failing to apply relevant research in their industries. This study successfully bridged the theory&#8209;practice gap in that it resolved a real&#8209;world problem and added to the body of knowledge, i.e. it aided to: identify underlying social root causes of a flawed project governance process and associated decision support software; define actions for improvement; and realise generalisable theoretical and applied knowledge to improve both theory and practice. It illustrates that collaborative academic research adds value to both academia and industry. This paper discusses an empirical study where soft systems methodology (SSM) was applied as an interventionist action research (AR) method, positioned in the critical systems thinking (CST) and critical social research (CSR) paradigm. SSM is defined as a learning system that facilitates the identification of actions for improvement of problematical social contexts—it gives epistemological guidance to systematically explore perspectives of individuals involved in and affected by social (e.g. organisational) settings, to identify actions for improvement. However, SSM is found to be most often applied interpretively by academia, i.e., to understand a problem context, rather than to improve it, and by practitioners as a consulting tool. SSM successfully facilitates exploring of problematical social contexts, but, according to users of it, fail to effect real and lasting change. It is also quite difficult to extract generalisable learning from its output. In this study, the researcher argues that SSM have the potential to live up to its original intent. So, she positioned SSM in the CST/CSR paradigm by applying an enriched version of it. She guided participants to reflect on inherent flaws in the scrutinised project governance business process and associated decision support software. Hence, by applying methodological pluralism, she also guided them to reflect on actions for change in light of the organisation’s socially constructed structures and their effects on involved and affected stakeholders of the process. SSM was enriched by also reflecting on the output of facilitated workshops, which aimed to identify required transformation to improve upon deficient project governance, from the perspectives of: the role of the participant(s) in the organisation; the effects that identified organisational decisions and changes may have on them; and by asking probing questions about the crux of statements made, e.g. if it is presumed to be true, what would the effect be, or vice versa. The outcome was emancipation, as key underlying social and structural causes for the organisational deficiencies surfaced.

Abstract:
Software engineering (SE) research addresses not only technical issues but also human behaviour. SE is considered as an immature discipline because many technical and social issues concerning software development and management have yet to be specified. SE in general is inclined towards quantitative approaches. Nevertheless, qualitative methods are still appropriate for SE research as the methods encourage deep understanding of subject matter. Grounded Theory (GT) is regarded as one of the potential qualitative methods that is applicable to SE research. The method is able to transform less and unknown SE phenomena into cohesive theories through systematic discovery of empirical data from the ground. This paper shares some encounters of using GT in SE research based on the reflection made on several SE research projects covering various phases of software development life cycle. The encounters are then transformed into adaptations and classified as GT practices for SE research, as an effort to inspire the spirit of using GT in SE particularly among novices. The practices embrace aspects concerning formulating research questions, handling preconceptions, utilising software tools, getting access to data and presenting theory and its development process. To illustrate on how the practices were derived, a case study is presented. The proposed GT practices could act as the starting point of adopting GT in SE research. They shall be refined and improved in future to possibly become best practices when more and more experience of using GT in SE are obtained.

Title:
The Research Audit Trail: Methodological Guidance for Application in Practice
Pages:

Marian Carcary
Abstract:
The merits of qualitative research remain an issue of ongoing debate and investigation. Qualitative researchers emphasise issues such as credibility, dependability, and transferability  in demonstrating the trustworthiness of their research outcomes. This refers to the extent to which the research outcomes are conceptually sound and serves as the basis for enabling other researchers to assess their value. Carcary (2009) proposed trustworthiness in qualitative inquiry could be established through developing a physical and intellectual research audit trail – a strategy that involves maintaining an audit of all key stages and theoretical, methodological, and analytical decisions, as well as documenting how a researcher’s thinking evolves throughout a research project. Since 2009, this publication has been cited in greater than 600 studies. The current paper provides an analysis of the use and value of the research audit trail, based on the author’s application of this strategy across diverse research projects in the field of Information Systems management over a ten year time period. Based on a critical reflection on insights gained through these projects, this paper provides an in&#8209;depth discussion of a series of guidelines for developing and applying the research audit trail in practice. These guidelines advance existing thinking and provide practical recommendations in relation to maintaining a research audit trail throughout a research project. Based on these guidelines and the core issues that should be covered at a physical and intellectual research audit trail level, a checklist that can be tailored to each project’s context is provided to support novice researchers and those who are new to the research audit trail strategy. As such, this paper demonstrates commitment to rigor in qualitative research. It provides a practical contribution in terms of advancing guidelines and providing a supporting checklist for ensuring the quality and transparency of theoretical, methodological, and analytical processes in qualitative inquiry. Embedding these guidelines throughout the research process will promote critical reflection among researchers across all stages of qualitative research and, in tracing through the researcher’s logic, will provide the basis for enabling other researchers to independently assess whether the research findings can serve as a platform for further investigation.
