Abstract:
A community e&#8209;portal facilitates dynamic (developing), value (financial and non&#8209;financial), constellation (collaborative networks), which supports community integration and economic growth. The OECD has identified that social cohesion rather than narrow economic gain is the most significant outcome for societies where all citizens, through learning and the transfer of knowledge, skills and attitudes, leads to becoming more effective and proactive participants in civil and economic processes. In this work, action research facilitated design, development, and implementation of a community&#8209;portal dynamic&#8209;value constellation to support networked value chains, community, and local government connectivity. The research gives insights through working closely with stakeholders.  The research domain represents a novel value creation model, incorporating technologies and solutions in the context of virtual enterprises, partnerships and joint ventures and other market&#8209;driven value constellations, where partners dynamically come together in response to or in anticipation of new market opportunities.  Such constellations, however, bring with them significant operational and logistical challenges, about which there has been very little prior knowledge.

Abstract:
This article presents an empirical study that was conducted in three towns (Lusaka, Livingstone and Kitwe) in Zambia to ascertain the awareness of citizens about the anticipated value that e&#8209;government adds to public service provision. Awareness entails that citizens are able to identify the opportunities that e&#8209;government has to offer in the delivery of public services. Using a Mixed Methods Research (MMR) approach, the study measured the perception of citizens on the overall e&#8209;government agenda. Spearman’s rho was used to determine concurrent and construct validity of the data collection instruments. Restricted factor analysis with Kaiser Normalization identified eight predictor factors explaining 23 percent of the variance in the model indicating acceptance and/or awareness of e&#8209;government applications. The results of the research indicate that with the likelihood of a majority of citizens aware of and utilising e&#8209;government once it is globally rolled out, there are chances that e&#8209;government may positively impact on the bureaucratic nature of government and ultimately improve public service delivery in Zambia. Further, this research suggests there are encouraging indications for effective development of e&#8209;government in Zambia. The limitation of the study is that the sampled population may not be statistically representative of the general population in Zambia and therefore it is not possible to generalise the outcomes of this research.

Abstract:
Local e&#8209;government enables citizens at all levels to interact with government easily and access services through electronic means. It enables electronic transactions between government departments and the private sector to take place easily and cheaply. Despite these benefits, its implementation in economically and technologically transitioning countries remains problematic. This is largely due to the gap between the existing e&#8209;government implementation models and the local context for these countries. This study attempts to address this problem by describing a model for local e&#8209;government implementation in a transitioning country, Uganda.  A field study was used to gather requirements for the model.  The results are used to extend an existing model in order to describe a suitable one for Uganda. Basing on the results collected from the field, the research recommends that the extended model for local e&#8209;government implementation should address the dimensions of financial Resource mobilization, ICT infrastructure, training, sensitization, trust and social political factors. The model was validated in a questionnaire based field study

Abstract:
In spite of the gradual increase in the number of academic studies on smuggling crime, focus is seldom placed on the application of data mining to crime prevention. This study provides deeper understanding and exploration of the benefits of information technology for the identification of smuggling crime. This study focuses on smuggling of vessels. The data source is the complete record of fishing vessels leaving and returning to ports in the Taiwan region. This paper essay applies both artificial neural networks (ANN) and logistics regression (LR) to classify and predict criminal behaviors in smuggling. At the same time, it shows the difference between ANN and human inspection (HI), also the difference between LR and HI. This study establishes models for vessels of different tonnage and operation purposes that can provide law enforcers with clearer judgment criteria. It is needed to construct different models for vessels to achieve the actual cases in the reality since smugglers will use different kinds of ship for different smuggling purposes. The study results show that the application of artificial neural networks to smuggling fishing vessels attains an average precision of 76.3%, and the application of logistic regression to smuggling fishing vessels can achieve an average precision of 60.5%, both of which are of significantly higher efficiency levels compared with the current human inspection (HI) method. This study suggests the value of using an artificial neural networks model to obtain good identification performance for different vessel types as well as average savings of 90.47% on the manpower loading. Information technology can greatly help to increase the probability of seizing smuggling fishing vessels. Nowadays, public administration information is saved electronically however is not employed well. In fact, it can increase the administrative efficiency by proper use of electronic data. In this study, for example, we expect better use of the data stored in the database to establish an identifying model of smuggling. Applying the automatic identification mechanism, it is useful to reduce the probability of smuggling crime.

Abstract:
Government 2.0 is often presented as a means to reinforce the relation between state and citizens in an information age. The promise of Government 2.0 is impressive but its potential has not or hardly been realized yet in practice. This paper uses insights from various disciplines to understand Government 2.0 as an institutional transformation. It focuses on three key issues &#8209; leadership in government, incentives for citizens and mutual trust &#8209; and our analysis shows that Government 2.0 efforts are too often guided by overly optimistic and simplified ideas about these issues. Our discussion suggests that there are no easy, one&#8209;size&#8209;fits&#8209;all ways to address challenges of leadership, citizen incentives and trust: a contextual approach and hard work is needed to tackle these challenges. Realizing Government 2.0 means looking beyond the technology and understanding its potential in a specific situation.

Is e&#8209;democracy more than democratic? &#8209; An examination of the implementation of socially sustainable values in e&#8209;democratic processes

Authors:
Gustav Lidén
Abstract:
A growing literature tries to contribute to a more balanced view of the concept of e&#8209;democracy. However, one seldom discussed aspect is the concept’s inadequate dimension on what a desirable development of society consists of. By adding certain values, today most pronounced in the theory of social sustainability, this article examines the awareness of such in three e&#8209;democratic projects in Swedish municipalities. This is carried out through a qualitative inquiry that uses different types of data and that regards social sustainability as an ongoing process that is suitable to be analysed in relation to other structures in society. The empirical part reveals different important topics. First it shows that the conscious¬ness of socially sustainable values varies between the examined cases. Second, this variation can be due to both the varying success of e&#8209;democracy and to conditions inside the political organizations. In conclusion, this paper reveals that the consequence of adding a socially sustainable perspective to e&#8209;democracy is that it provides adequate opportunities for analysing social development without missing out qualities that are desired in a democratic society.

Abstract:
This study proposes data mining solutions for local municipalities to make their decision support mechanism easier. The purpose of this study is to get intelligent solutions related to local government services from past data and to estimate the future activities. It covers socio&#8209;cultural analyses, income/expense analyses, infrastructure analyses, fraud detection analyses, simplification, verification and similarity analyses. Proposed system is based on service oriented architecture. The purposes of this project are; to give information about current state, to facilitate decision making for future activities, to increase income and decrease expense, to supply easy and correct data input to the system and to supply easier document tracking system. Seventeen scenarios were created initially. These scenarios are; Staff Analyzing, Classifying Citizens According to Real Estate Tax, Distribution of Citizens delaying Real Estate Tax, Income Operations Analyzing, Fuel Oil Analyzing, Electricity Consumption Analyzing, Cash Desk Analyzing, Distribution of Corporate Foundation, Moveable Material Analyzing, Logs Analyzing, Water Notice Analyzing, User Accounts Analyzing, Accountancy Analyzing, Employee Analyzing, Estimation of Wages, Citizen Analyzing and Corporate Foundation Analyzing. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is used as software architecture. Five services &#8209; Association Rule Mining Web Service (ARMWS), Outlier Detection Analysis Web Service (ODAWS), Classification Web Service (CWS), Clustering Web Service (ClustWS) and Data Preparation Web Service (DPWS) &#8209; were created. 7 scenarios used ARMWS, 3 scenarios used ODAWS, 2 scenarios used CWS and ClustWS is used by 5 scenarios.

The Disruptive Innovation Theory Applied to National Implementations of E&#8209;procurement

Andrey M. Elizondo
Abstract:
Due to its characteristics, size, and impact, e&#8209;procurement has a strategic importance not only for public administration but for e&#8209;government, since its implementation necessarily crosses many institutional barriers and paradigms of many public managers. E&#8209;procurement brings a set of new rules and dynamics that create ways of doing business with the State in a totally different fashion, with a whole new and bigger set of participants, new incentives and a radically different cost structure; conditions that have the potential to create a competitive marketplace of unparalleled transparency, efficiency and access.  While worldwide public e&#8209;procurement has been linked to a myriad of promises, in practice, it has achieved little.  Our research, however, shows that to date literature has failed to recognize that e&#8209;procurement is a disruptive innovation, based on also disruptive technologies. A fundamental difference exists between disruptive and sustainable innovations. Empirical evidence suggests the relevance of recognizing a disruptive innovation and its implications as a key success factor. By not considering these implications prior to implementation, strategic actions at the level of organization, resources, people and values, which significantly affects the results derived from the implementation were not considered, and therefore, many promises remain unfulfilled.The findings of this research contribute to an expanded understanding of the factors that promote successful implementation of nation&#8209;wide e&#8209;procurement systems at a time when this technology and operational model is widely needed as many governments are struggling with flawed attempts to implement these systems.

Abstract:
The paper explores whether Living Labs, acting as open innovation intermediaries, can address some of the challenges surrounding the sustainable adoption of eParticipation tools and methods. We begin by analysing the existing literature on Living Labs and Open Innovation, and the extent to which Living Labs can act as innovation intermediaries as envisioned by Chesbrough (2006), Wolpert (2002) and others. We then consider the research on eParticipation, and in particular some of the risks and challenges surrounding the sustainability of innovation in this area. In the second part of the paper, focusing on the PARTERRE project, we present the methodology and key findings of six eParticipation pilots. Further comments and analysis based on these findings is provided, examining issues such as inter&#8209;cultural barriers, technological factors, organisational concerns and participant feedback. Finally, we present some conclusions in the light of the findings.

From “Rules to Interpret” to “Rules to Follow”: ePrescription in Greece

Abstract:
This paper aims to contribute to the on&#8209;going discourse on how to design and introduce governance technology for highly reliable professional work within healthcare. With this aim, we study the Greek ePrescription initiative. The empirical data used in this paper were collected over a nine month period from three different pharmacies implementing the new ePrescription platform. The analysis of data led to the identification of tensions between the established way of performing work (which was based on professionalism and discretion) and the new way imposed by ePrescribing (which is based on activity control and monitoring). Pharmacists traditionally interpreted rules in the light of knowledge, practice/habitude and contextual specificities but with ePrescribing the rules are solidified. From “rules to interpret” they turned to “rules to follow”. The tensions are currently resolved by pharmacists with the employment of workarounds. We view workarounds as indications of incongruence between technology and task that can be productively used for design improvement. Furthermore, we attempt to generalise the case&#8209;specific insights by linking redesign recommendations to the concepts of usability, tailorability, and generativity of information systems.

Abstract:
There is an increasing demand for opening data provided by public and private organisations. Various organisations have already started to publish their data and potentially there are many benefits to gain. However, realising the intended positive effects and creating value from using open data on a large scale is easier said than done. Opening and using data encounters numerous impediments which can have both a socio and a technical nature. Yet, no overview of impediments is available from the perspective of the open data user.  Socio&#8209;technical impediments for the use of open data were identified based on a literature overview, four workshops and six interviews. An analysis of these 118 impediments shows that open data policies provide scant attention to the user perspective, whereas users are the ones generating value from open data. The impediments that the open data process currently encounters were analysed and categorized in ten categories: 1) availability and access, 2) find ability, 3) usability, 4) understand ability, 5) quality, 6) linking and combining data, 7) comparability and compatibility, 8) metadata, 9) interaction with the data provider, and 10) opening and uploading. The impediments found in literature differ from impediments that were found in empirical research. Our overview of impediments derived from both literature and empirical research is therefore more comprehensive than what was already available. The comprehensive overview of impediments can be used as a basis for improving the open data process, and can be extended in further research. This will result in the solving of some impediments and new impediments might rise over time.

The Challenge of Technolgy: Alignment Dynamics in Local Governments

Authors:
Elke Boudry & Pieter Verdegem
Abstract:
: In organization literature, strategic alignment is a key concept. A vast amount of literature focuses on the need for businesses for aligning their business and IT strategy. The importance of alignment in (local) governments is yet underexposed.  However, local governments are also challenged to incorporate IT in their daily processess and they also strive to become more efficient and effective organizations. In practice, this proves to be a dynamic process where a lot of factors come into play when technology is introduced within these organizations. In research, there is a need for a better understanding of this dynamic process of alignment. Therefore, in this paper we want to explore the dynamic process of aligning local governments with technology. We do so by using the 7Smodel as a framework to analyze how seven different elements, both hard and soft, mutually affect each other and make out the local dynamics. Furthermore, we put forward the notion of strong and weak alignment and offer new insights into ‘disaligned’ organizations. Increasing insights into the organizational factors that encircle the implementation of technology will lead to a more profound understanding of how the process of alignment comes into practice in local governments. By taking into account this complex process of alignment IT projects can become more successful.

Virtual Acts of Balance!: Virtual Technologies of Knowledge&#8209;Management as co&#8209;Produced by Social Intentions and Technical Limitations
Pages:
pp183&#8209;197
Authors:
Anders Koed Madsen
Abstract:
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of official documents and white papers pertaining to two web&#8209;portals (The Policy Grid Project and FEED) that are launched in the United Kingdom (UK) and the European Union (EU) respectively. The aim of the portals is to filter and synthesize information relevant for policy discussions and thereby improve ´knowledge&#8209;democracy´ in different ways. The paper denotes such portals ´virtual technologies of knowledge management´ and it presents documental data as a window to analyze and discuss the infrastructural choices of such portals. The analysis is grounded in theories related to Social Construction of Technology and it shows how the framing of the portals and the concrete digital choices taken in relation to the infrastructure are influenced by the intentions of relevant social groups as well as by the technical limitations on computers abilities to process semantic data. It is especially emphasized how technical web&#8209;ontologies implicitly carry with them deeper philosophical ontologies about phenomena such as ´politics´, ´scientific intentionality´ and ´freedom´. The compromise between these technical limitations and the social intentions is described as a ´virtual act of balance´. The paper accordingly concludes that a co&#8209;production of technical infrastructures and social values takes place in the process of designing these types of portals. It illustrates the necessity of formalizing part of the policy&#8209;making process if semantic machines are to play a significant role in policy&#8209;making. Computer&#8209;based information&#8209;processing makes software increasingly powerful and it is argued that the ´e&#8209;governance community´ has to be reflective about this development and constantly consider the trade&#8209;offs between structured semantics and looser types of classification of policy issues.

Challenging Organizational Issues When Municipal Contact Centers are Implemented in Sweden

Authors:

Kerstin Grundén
Abstract:
Abstract: Two case studies of the implementation of Contact Centers (CCs) in Swedish municipalities are compared and discussed from an organizational perspective.  The research method was semi&#8209;structured qualitative interviews with different personnel categories in both municipalities.  Several challenging organizational issues for management and employees were identified.  The implementation strategies varied between the cases and affected the pace of implementation, attitudes and motivation, the mental constructs and understanding of the implementation.  The financing of the CCs and recruitment strategies created problems, but in somewhat different ways and different phases of the process in each case.  The potential of using registered information as a source for planning and decision&#8209;making was not fully utilized in the municipal organizations, although some statistics were produced.  In both cases there was a combination of formal and informal learning strategies and flexible co&#8209;operation among the employees in the CCs which contributed to continuous learning processes and a good, co&#8209;operative working climate.  There was a need for continuous updating of skills in both cases, but with slightly different focus, related to the organization of the work.  The organization in response groups required more specialist competence, compared with the organization without response groups, which required more general competence.  Two challenges for the case administrators in the back offices were to adapt to a more process&#8209;oriented organization of their work and to co&#8209;operate more with their colleagues both in the back office and at the CC.  They now had the possibility to plan their administrative work in a better way than before, but some administrators missed the previous spontaneous contacts with citizens.  Initially, many case administrators were afraid of losing their jobs and work tasks to CCs, contributing to negative attitudes towards CC and hampering the learning process in taking part in the implementation process.

While the social objective is of protecting poor citizens from the vagaries of market forces,  the PDS current system has several well documented problems such as lack of transparency, accountability, poor governance and poor service delivery mechanisms. Several suggestions have been made for improvement through technology intervention. In this paper we describe a mobile technology enabled system that we have developed. We have conducted a sample survey across urban slums to elicit responses about the existing PDS, to understand the problems faced by users and to obtain input on the features and functionality required to improve the PDS system. This questionnaire was designed and administered as a mobile form. The SmartPDS solution that has been developed uses low&#8209;cost mobile technologies and a workflows&#8209;based request tracking system to enable the delivery of critical governance services such as food entitlements, at the doorstep of the citizen. The system leverages the expanding cellular network to enable a consumer to place an order on a mobile phone and the entire process of PDS service delivery can be monitored and tracked in near real&#8209;time. An electronic voucher scheme has been developed to implement a cashless benefits transfer system to reduce leakages in the system and improve tracking of a PDS transaction from the generation of a consumer request to the delivery of food items to the consumer.

Abstract:
Abstract: Whilst online social networking has been used successfully for many years by all strata of the worlds population, its use to ferment and prevent civil disturbances is a relatively new phenomenon. It is clear that the way in which online social networking sites are being used is evolving, and that changing user perceptions of online privacy may impact on the ability of the law enforcement community to adapt to new methods of monitoring and evidence gathering. This paper focuses primarily on the London riots of August 2011, and as such discusses legal issues from a UK perspective. However, the matters discussed are of relevance worldwide, with reference made to similar events outside the UK, to show that what occurred in London was not an isolated incident, or a quirk of the UK social networking scene. This paper explores what occurred, the platforms that were used and how they were used, and the legal framework in which investigations took place. It examines the use of social networking to organise rioters, support community defence, and shape the response of law enforcement agencies such as the police, government and the courts. It concludes that there is significant potential for problems of this type to occur in the future, which will require the evolution of law enforcement methods and procedures, and could change the way in which the law enforcement community utilise e&#8209;Government systems

Prince Karakire Guma
Abstract:
Abstract. The traditional portrait of many governments worldwide, synonymous with a massive bureaucratic machinery operating inefficiently, unresponsively and at high cost, is gradually fading. Over the past two or so decades, Sub&#8209;Saharan African countries, have witnessed wide&#8209;ranging public&#8209;sector reforms often in search of effective and efficient systems of government. One such reform came in the form of ICT. Driven by the belief that e&#8209;government is one of the key motors to achieve significant leaps needed for reform, governments are taking wide&#8209;ranging initiatives to work better. This paper aimed at examining trends in public&#8209;sector reform that lead to contemporary e&#8209;government practice, highlighting experiences from an African country. Using the case study approach, the paper presents a historiographical analysis of public&#8209;sector reforms in Africa, and the role of ICTs in Ugandas quest for efficient and effective systems of administration.

Abstract:
Abstract: With the dawn of the technological age due to the wide spread of information and communication technologies (ICTs), e&#8209;government is fast becoming of prime importance. This has prompted many governments (those of Sub&#8209;Saharan African &#8209; SSA included) to start thinking of going digital. This growing importance stems from the fact that e&#8209;government has the capability of promoting better governance, transparency, raising service performance and eliminating bottlenecks in the service delivery process. This paper is based on a literature review of the papers and documents relating to e&#8209;government and investigates the challenges to the successful implementation of e&#8209;government initiatives in all the 49 African countries in SSA for the period 2001 to 2012. In order to conduct a systematic review the guidelines suggested by Webster and Watson (2002) and Okoli and Schabram (2010) have been followed. In total 75 relevant articles and documents have been examined all of which have been published in leading journals, conferences proceedings, reports from governmental and non&#8209;governmental organizations. The results show that ICT infrastructure, human resources, legal framework, Internet access, the digital divide, and connectivity are among the most common themes on the challenges to the successful implementation of e&#8209;government initiatives in Sub&#8209;Saharan African countries. These themes are further grouped into six different aspects abbreviated as IF&#8209;POSH (Infrastructural, financial, political, organisational, socio&#8209;economic and human). Among these six aspects, infrastructural and human aspects are the most important challenges that the respective governments in SSA need to address prior to adopting implementation strategies. The study suggests that governments of the Sub&#8209;Saharan African countries can benefit from the advantages of e&#8209;government if they address these challenges collectively allowing for the sensitivity of certain socio&#8209;economic realities.

Abstract:
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis for level of e&#8209;government implementation in the context of a developing country. The purpose of the study was to understand the level of e&#8209;government implementation in Malawi focusing on examining websites for government ministries and departments. Quantitative and partly qualitative data was used to analyse seven websites for government ministries and departments. The results were compared with indicators for e&#8209;government implementation from international development agencies. The findings confirmed that the level of e&#8209;government implementation was in the early stages of presence and interaction. Additionally, the results showed slow growth in e&#8209;government implementation because of limited integration of public services. The study provides insights that may be useful in improving the implementation of e&#8209;government.

Online Transparency for Accountability: One Assessing Model and two Applications
Pages:
pp279&#8209;291
Authors:
Rui Pedro Lourenço
Abstract:
Abstract: This paper proposes, in the context of Open Government, a model to assess how public sector entities are taking advantage of the Internet as an information disclosure tool and a means to promote transparency, specifically in what concerns the use of public resources (input transparency for accountability). The assessment model and resulting Transparency Index gives particular attention to the disclosure of detailed (disaggregated) data according to the principles of Open Government Data, namely by valuing data visibility, adequate format for further processing, and the autonomous presentation of individual information items. Subsequently, the paper demonstrates the applicability of the proposed model by carrying out two assessment exercises on two subsets of Portuguese and Italian municipalities. Results show that, all in all, the municipalities analysed do not yet disclose enough information useful for accountability processes and they do not take advantage of the Internet potential to make the data provided more visible and re&#8209;usable by citizens and local stakeholders. Alone, high&#8209;level policy directives, governmental requirements and national legislation guaranteeing access to information are not enough to ensure public entities (municipalities in particular) disclose all the relevant data, and therefore specific guidelines are needed.

Conceptualization of an integrated indicator model for the evaluation of e&#8209;government policies

Authors:
Dalibor Stanimirovic
Abstract:
Following the initial success of the information and communication technology&#8209;enabled changes in the public sector, the concept of e&#8209;government was expected to provide a leap forward, facilitating the comprehensive reform of public administration operations and redefinition of service delivery to citizens. Despite the significant advancement in the last decade or so, the contribution of e&#8209;government in achieving the increased acceptance of online government services, cost reduction and greater effectiveness of public administration has remained rather ambiguous and undetermined. All these facts suggest that current planning, development and implementation of e&#8209;government policies is unsatisfactory, whereas lacking reliable indicator models consequently results in arbitrary evaluation and uninformed decision&#8209;making in the e&#8209;government field. Paper presents an analysis of existing indicator models for evaluation of e&#8209;government policies, identifies characteristic evaluation aspects and evaluation levels, and conceptualizes an integrated indicator model for evaluation of e&#8209;government policies. Analysis offers an insight into the current evaluation practice, enables detection of its deficiencies and provides a valuable contribution to the development of applicable indicator models facilitating more evidence&#8209;based evaluation of e&#8209;government policies. .

Tero Päivärinta
Abstract:
Abstract. Public procurement constitutes a large part of the market in many countries, and it has the potential of playing an important role in stimulating communities and serving policy goals. With this in mind the governments have set regulations for public procurement. Procurement of Information Systems is especially challenging due to the complexity of procuring unknown technology and the importance an information system has for different stakeholders in an organization. Public procurement of information systems (IS) and services provides several challenges to the stakeholders involved in the procurement processes. However, these are not well established or understood, and there is a knowledge gap that needs to be covered. This paper presents results from a Delphi study, which involved 46 experienced procurement managers, chief information officers, and vendor representatives in the Norwegian public sector. The participants identified 98 challenges related to IS procurement, and subsequently ranked the relative importance of the top issues. The study supports findings from previous research related to diverging stakeholder goals; challenges in balancing between objectives; in requirement specifications; and in too narrow cost focus. In addition to providing empirical confirmation of these previous propositions the study revealed new findings, such as benefits realization in IS procurement; coordinating and standardizing public procurement processes; complex and constraining government regulations; issues of technological integration and compatibility; and inter&#8209;municipal cooperation. Developing clear requirements specifications stands out as critical for public sector officials. The results provide a rich overview of IS procurement challenges in the public sector in Norway, and may also give a good picture of challenges in other countries with similar procurement regulations.

Leonidas Anthopoulos et al
Abstract:
Abstract: Smart cities suggest a domain that attracts an increasing scientific, political and economic attention. However, this domain is still confusing, since various parties define or apply alternative perspectives. Scientists document a technological smart city evolution from a website form to modern ubiquitous and eco&#8209;friendly ones; city networks describe this phenomenon more likely as a measurement system for intelligence in urban areas; business sector recognizes smart cities as ⠜application boxes⠀ for information technologies etc. This paper focuses on the abovementioned technological approaches to smart city and realizes that each approach attracted various cases, which later evolved to other forms or declined. To this end, it seeks to answer the following questions: what different technological approaches to smart city exist or have existed and how can they ⠜fit⠀ to market&#8209;driven defined approaches? How have the smart cities evolved? Do particular technology evolution roadmaps exist for smart cities? In order to answer these questions, this paper performs smart city classification, according to the alternative technological approaches that appear in literature and determines representative city cases together with similarities and differences among these approaches. Literature review is combined with data from the official websites of the representative cases, which returns groups of e&#8209;services that are being offered by different smart city approaches. These e&#8209;service groups are used to identify evolution roadmaps for smart city that can show how smart cities have emerged and to which particular directions are being evolved. The evolution roadmaps are depicted via the technology roadmapping tool. These roadmaps can become a useful tool for decision makers, who have to choose between alternative evolution forms and projects that secure smart city⠒s viability. Viability is a crucial parameter for every project, especially due to recent financial recession, since smart cities demand extensive funding, which significantly affects la

Abstract:
Abstract: This article examines the way stakeholders in parts of the UK local government community have developed a set of tools and frameworks for supporting e&#8209;Government&#8209;related change. In particular, it looks at how ideas from Activity&#8209;Based Costing have been drawn upon to support business process improvements and decisions about delivery channels. The article follows the evolution of an approach known as the Cost Architecture Framework and how this is being used by public bodies to support more efficient and effective service designs. The implications of the approach  including its links to ideas on lean management  are then discussed. The article provides an insight into how communities of actors can come together to develop common approaches and solutions in addressing their e&#8209;Government needs. It also discusses the limits to such collaborations in the face of resource constraints, and the need for end&#8209;user customisation in supporting local applications.

Abstract:
Abstract: Despite the development of Open Data platforms, the wider deployment of Open Data still faces significant barriers. It requires identifying the obstacles that have prevented e&#8209;government bodies either from implementing an Open Data strategy or from ensuring its sustainability.This paper presents the results of a study carried out between June and November 2012, in which we analyzed three cases of Open Data development through their platforms, in a medium size city (Rennes, France), a large city (Berlin, Germany), and at national level (UK). It aims to draw a clear typology of challenges, risks, limitations, barriers, all terms used by the different stakeholders with diverse meanings and based on different motivations. Indeed the issues and constraints faced by re&#8209;users of public data differ from the ones encountered by the public data providers. Through the analysis of the experiences in opening data, we attempt to identify how barriers were overcome and how risks were managed. Beyond passionate debates in favor or against Open Data, we propose to consider the development of an Open Data initiative in terms of risks, contingency actions, and expected opportunities. We therefore present in the next sections the risks to Open Data organized in 7 categories: (1) governance, (2) economic issues, (3) licenses and legal frameworks, (4) data characteristics, (5) metadata, (6) access, and (7) skills.

Evaluation and Assessment of Editable Signatures for Trusted and Reliable Public Sector Data

Authors:
Klaus Stranacher et al
Abstract:
Abstract: Due to the increased application of information and communication technologies in the public sector, the amount of data being produced and processed by the public sector has been constantly growing during the past years. As these data can also be useful for the general public and the corporate sector, current initiatives attempt to make these data publicly available. Recent work on this topic has shown that publishing of public sector data potentially raises several issues regarding data integrity and authenticity. These issues render the implementation of solutions based on trusted and reliable public sector data difficult. However, recent work has proposed electronic signatures in general and editable electronic signatures in particular as adequate means to address these issues. While a variety of editable signature schemes has been introduced in literature, their capabilities to assure the integrity and authenticity of published public sector data has not been assessed so far. This renders a concrete implementation of solutions based on editable signatures impossible. To overcome this problem, this paper identifies and discusses legal, organisational, and technical requirements that need to be met by editable signature schemes when applied to public sector data to be published. Afterwards, different existing editable signature schemes are examined and discussed in more detail. Based on the previously identified requirements, the different editable signature schemes are then assessed in detail. The conducted assessment reveals that blank digital signatures, which are a novel approach representing a subset of editable signature schemes, are especially suited to meet the predefined requirements. The results obtained from the conducted survey served as input and basis for the implementation of solutions based on trusted and reliable public sector data.

Abstract:
Abstract: After having briefly introduced the issue of measuring e&#8209;Government vis&#8209;à&#8209;vis its impact evaluation, the paper provides an overview of the state of the art with regard to measurement of e&#8209;Government, addressing the debate on the relationship between 'public value' creation and e&#8209;Government, outlining some of the approaches advanced to measure the public value of ICT interventions in the public sector. In light of this discussion, the paper then proposes the eGEP&#8209;2.0 model which, building on its predecessor eGEP, overcome many of the limitations of existing frameworks, and more importantly pave the way for an effective impact assessment of e&#8209;Government initiatives, in relation to the policy&#8209;making process and related governance needed for their design and implementation. The results of the application of the eGEP&#8209;2.0 model on the Telematics and Informatics Plan (PiTER) of the Emilia Romagna Region in Italy are then presented and discussed. The paper concludes providing some reflections on the experience and outlining future research challenges.

Abstract:
Abstract: E&#8209;government (e&#8209;gov) has become indispensable for government modernization. Its success, however, is contingent upon its adoption by the intended users. This research used an extended version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model to investigate a number of factors that are believed to affect the Kuwaiti citizens adoption of the traffic violation e&#8209;payment system (TVEPS). Effort expectancy and social influence were found to influence the use intention, and users Internet experience moderated such a relationship. However, performance expectancy did not influence the intention to use TVEPS. Facilitating condition, trust and use intention were found to influence the actual use of the system. While gender moderated the relationship between facilitating conditions and actual use of the system, awareness moderated the relationship of trust and use intention with the actual use of the system. These findings and their implications are further discussed in the paper.

Abstract:
Abstract: This study summarizes and analyses the demographic, socio&#8209;economic, and geographic factors affecting electronic tax filing (e&#8209;filing) in the United States for the years 1999, and 20042007 and the growth in e&#8209;filing between 1999 and 2007. Beyond the descriptive analysis, two issues related to electronic tax filing are target of further analysis: First, the variables having a positive impact on e&#8209;filing rates and e&#8209;filing growth are analysed. Second, because a more detailed look at state and county data indicates high variability within and between states, some demographic, socio&#8209;economic, and geographic variables are examined in more detail. This second question addresses the possibility that e&#8209;filing  just like other initiatives involving electronic media  could increase the digital gap. We use zip&#8209;code level e&#8209;filing information and county level demographic, income and unemployment data for each of the years in question. Our findings indicate significant variation in e&#8209;filing rates across and within states, and rapid growth over time. E&#8209;filing rates are found to be lower in rural counties, counties with low population size, counties with a lower share of females, counties with a higher share of Hispanics and Asians, and counties with a higher share of the elderly population. Surprisingly, educational attainment is negatively correlated with e&#8209;filing rate and growth in e&#8209;filing.

Abstract:
Abstract: E&#8209;government has been developing across the world during last ten&#8209;fifteen years remarkably fast. The most developed countries have already demonstrated significant progress in e&#8209;government development. Developing countries are also making efforts to overcome various obstacles in their e&#8209;government journey. Many research papers and survey reports have been published in this domain. However, there is a lack of research on e&#8209;government development in Central Asia, particularly on e&#8209;government progress and issues in Kyrgyzstan. The objective of this research is to examine how e&#8209;government helps to enhance government processes in Kyrgyzstan with a major focus on improving public service delivery. This paper investigates the official web sites of the Kyrgyz Government ministries and agencies and the extent to which they provide online transactional services to the public and other organizations and analyzes their efforts in engaging citizens in the processes of governance.

E&#8209;government Use and Citizen Empowerment: Examining the Effects Of Online Information On Political Efficacy

Abstract:
Abstract: Although the government has made enormous investments in the area of e&#8209;government, whether these efforts do indeed promote greater citizen participation is still being debated between those optimistic and those pessimistic about ICTs potential to change the way people interact with government. This study hopes to bring forth a new perspective, by injecting new empirical evidence, to revitalize discussions between opposing views on ICTs, by arguing that information technology could elevate political efficacy and indirectly enhance political participation. This research attempts to answer the following questions: Does e&#8209;government use increase citizens political efficacy? What are the different influences e&#8209;government mechanisms have on internal and external Internet political efficacy?. A regression analysis was used as the method for analyzing data collected from a telephone survey of all Taiwanese citizens above the age of twelve, and with experiences in the use of e&#8209;government services. The results show that factors which affect internal and external Internet political efficacy are different. The enhancement of external Internet political efficacy factors are not directly related to the e&#8209;government mechanism, but are related to citizens trust in e&#8209;government, political trust, and external political efficacy. Whereas information update speed by e&#8209;government and citizen usage needs for e&#8209;government factors,  affect internal Internet political efficacy. The conclusions reached, in theory, would provide a new angle of reflection and research for the debate on the influences of technology use on civil participation, by technological optimists and pessimists. This new angle suggests that the effects of technology use are on the perceptions and attitudes related to civil participation, and not directly related to participation behaviors. In practice, this generates another urgent reason for the government to invest additional resources in the elevation of internet information quality.

The present research aims to evaluate the accessibility of three Moroccan e&#8209;government websites to people with disabilities. To achieve the realization of this research, we opted for the method AccessiWeb and we analyzed, following this methodology, four to seven pages in each website.  The evaluation results show the presence of several problems of accessibility in each of the three websites. Some accessibility problems, found in the three websites, are relating to level A criteria, other to level AA criteria, while the rest is relating to level AAA criteria. The presence of level A criteria that are not respected, in the three websites, makes us conclude that the three evaluated websites don’t meet the minimum level of accessibility. To reach the minimum level of accessibility, recommended by the W3C, all problems relating to level A and level AA criteria should be corrected. Various measures should be then taken to make the content of these websites perceivable, operable, understandable by users and robust. Thus, to make the content perceivable by users, the necessary measures to be taken can be summarized as follows : provide text equivalents for non&#8209;textual items, increase the contrast ratio, make time&#8209;based media clearly identifiable, provide summaries and titles for tables, make all links explicit, indicate changes of reading direction in the source code, organize the content by the use of titles, use CSS, associate form fields with relevant labels, offer accessible versions to documents for download and make it possible for users to control flashing contents. To make the content presented within the three websites operable, it is necessary to : make the control of time&#8209;based media and no time&#8209;based media possible by the keyboard, give pertinent titles for links and web pages, make explicit links that open in a new window, add links that help to bypass the blocks of content and the groups of links, provide information about the documents for download, ensure that navigation does not contain keyboard traps and that the sitemap page shows the general architecture of the website. Concerning the third principle, which consists on making the content understandable by users, context changes should be initiated by explicit buttons, language changes should be indicated in the source code, the labels associated with form fields should be appended with their fields, the indication of mandatory fields should be visible and the input control should be accompanied by suggestions that facilitate the correction of errors. Finally, the respect of the last principle, relating to robust content, requires to provide for each framework used a relevant title, to provide equivalent alternatives, working without Java, for scripts, to correct errors that exist in the source code, to make all media compatible with assistive technologies, to define the type of each document, to make sure that hidden texts are correctly rendered by assistive technologies and to provide an appropriate title for each form button.

Abstract:
Abstract: E&#8209;governance is a way for governments to use the most innovative information and communication technologies (ICTs), to provide public and businesses with convenient access to government information and services, to improve the quality of the services and to provide greater opportunities to participate in government activities. E&#8209;government offers a huge movement to move forward with higher quality, cost&#8209;effective, government services and a better relationship between people and government. This paper investigates how public participant in e&#8209;government can be enhanced in Nepal with ethical implementation of e&#8209;government. A case study from e&#8209;government context in Nepal was taken to study public participation, service delivery, challenges and ethical issues. A policy network theory was applied on e&#8209;governance policy&#8209;making processes in the perspective of Nepal. The finding of the study was focused on good governance which includes issues of efficiency of service delivery, empowerment of citizens, transparency, and accountability. If applied effectively in developing countries like Nepal, e&#8209; government strategy can advance productivity in the public sector. The e&#8209;government ethics may cover the rights and duties of bodies involved in the development of information systems for public administration.

Abstract:
Abstract: This paper discusses the use of process models as an instrument to promote transparency and communication between public organizations and their clients (citizens). It depicts a way to design public services process models aiming at increasing their understandability. The design is based on a catalogue containing characteristics, operationalizations and mechanisms for designing understandability on public service process models. The use of the catalogue by process analysts and the level of understandability acquired by the generated models were evaluated through case studies at a public educational organization.  The results show that the proposed catalogue is applicable &#8209; process analysts were able to apply it in a reasonable time &#8209; and that more simple process models can be obtained, adequate for process explanation for citizens/users.

Abstract:
Abstract: In order to deliver services to citizens, public sector agencies of today offer various types of channels for interaction. In this article we aim to develop an understanding of the reciprocal relation between multi&#8209;channel services and work practice. By showing how actors at different organizational levels in an agency differ in their interpretation of multi&#8209;channel services we have generated knowledge that is essential in multi&#8209;channel strategy formulation. The study illustrates an example of an agency that works actively and in a mature way with e&#8209;government and e&#8209;services. This qualitative case study illustrates that the top level management, middle management and the case officers need to confront and discuss their understanding of e&#8209;government and their work practice in order to reach a situation where strategies actually are influencing daily work more explicitly. An important aspect is the decision to adopt an internal or external perspective on multi&#8209;channel service management. The result of this decision might be to view multi&#8209;channel service management as a way of reaching either internal agency efficiency or external citizen benefits.

Open data in Service design

Abstract:
Abstract: This paper proposes a review of the current approaches to encouraging the creation of services based on data, and an analysis of the creation of services from two open data platforms, in the UK and in Singapore. It also explores the roles that the (open) data can have in the design of services based on a theoretical framework of service innovation. Data can play different roles: (i) the service is based on data, (2) the service uses data as a resource, and (3) the service is validated or enriched with data but the data is not directly used or is not directly visible in the service. This offers new opportunities for the reuse of data and suggests a different approach to measuring the impact of opening datasets beyond the mere number of services created.

Citizen Involvement in Local Environmental Governance: A Methodology Combining Human&#8209;Centred Design and Living lab Approaches
Pages:
pp106&#8209;114

Abstract:
Abstract: Nowadays, involving citizens in Local Environmental Governance (LEG) is becoming increasingly important. In order to empower the role of citizen in this context, we propose an approach that relies on the establishment of a physical and intellectual space for shared understanding and collaboration between all stakeholders impacted by an environmental problem (in our case odour emission). Based on the development of an Information Technology (IT) system allowing odour emission measurement as well as the collection of citizen feedback, a Living Lab (LL) approach is being implemented that involves citizens, public authorities, industry and environmental non&#8209;governmental organisations (NGOs).  According to the definition of the European commission, Living Labs are open innovation environments in real&#8209;life settings, in which user&#8209;driven innovation is fully integrated within the co&#8209;creation process of new services, products and societal infrastructures. Based on this definition and considering, in our case, citizens as one of the end&#8209;users of the IT system, we argue that such an approach will empower their role in local environmental governance. This article presents the method and techniques that will be used in order to set up such a Living Lab. More precisely, we focus here on the first step of this method: defining the components that will support the management of a Living Lab relying on an IT system. This step consists in the identification of the Living Lab stakeholders (citizen, industry, public authorities, NGOs, etc.), including their characteristics, fears, expectations, involvement and engagement regarding the Living Lab. To do this, 2 main approaches are being combined: A Living Lab approach that aims to involve citizens in local Environmental Governance (LEG) design. Use of Human&#8209;Centred Design (HCD), to combine IT developments and LL needs, for example Personas methodology and usability test. A Living Lab relies mainly on stakeholders involvement in order to build trust and establish a common goal. In this sense, sociologists approaches ((Akrich et al. 2006);) bring valuable information on how to mobilise different actors in order to innovate (Actor Network Theory).  However, in the innovation process, these approaches are only considering human actors and do not take into account any technological aspects. However, if Living Labs are relying on human actors interactions it should also take into account their interactions with the IT system it is based on. In this case, Human&#8209;Centred Design (HCD) being an approach that aims to make IT systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, is to be considered as complementary to the sociologists approaches. This article, based on the work performed in the FP7 European project OMNISCIENTIS, presents the theoretical context in which this study takes place as well as the overall methodology.

Abstract:
Abstract: Over the past decade the World Wide Web has become a core platform for the electronic operation of government. Yet the shape and nature of government presence on the Web and the online community in which it resides remains poorly understood and relatively under&#8209;theorised. This paper analyses large&#8209;scale web crawling data that map the hyperlink network structure between government websites and the broader Web ecology in the UK. In particular, it reports the communities of websites within a hyperlink network of over 19,000 websites and over 135,000 hyperlinks derived from 75 key UK government seed sites at national, regional (i.e. Scotland and Wales) and local government levels. These website communities were derived by utilising Infomap, a state&#8209;of&#8209;the&#8209;art community detection algorithm that operate on the principle that flows of information in complex networks reveals community structure. Identifying and analysing online communities in which government websites reside provides insights in how hyperlink communities are arranged, that is, their emergent organizing principal and the importance of government in these online communities. It is hypothesized that online communities can occur around different policy topics (such as health, education or policing), or along institutional or jurisdictional boundaries (such as England, Scotland and Wales). Using this novel approach this paper demonstrates that communities emerge on both axes, and that social media and government portals are some of the most significant communities based on information flows. This research provides foundational knowledge about the role of government websites in the World Wide Web, the emergent online associations, and the changing dynamic of state information in the twenty&#8209;first century. It points to strategies for developing government Web presence in networks that matter.

E&#8209;government Policy Formation  Understanding the roles of change drivers, veto players and advocacy coalitions

Abstract:
Abstract: Despite its promise of increasing public authorities effectiveness, improving decision making and service delivery, e&#8209;government initiatives too often fail. So far, reasons for this have largely been sought in technological aspects of e&#8209;government. However, e&#8209;government is much more complex than that; e&#8209;government also encompasses aspects related to the inner workings of organizations, policy formation processes and change management. Based on an in&#8209;depth case study of an e&#8209;government policy formation process in the municipality of Vasteras, Sweden, this paper sets out to develop the understanding of e&#8209;government policy failure by elucidating how individuals actions, behaviors and decision affect endeavors to improve e&#8209;government policy agendas.  Applying theoretical concepts from political science and the change management literature, this paper describes how a change driver attempted to accomplish fundamental changes in the policy area of e&#8209;government, through involving as many stakeholders as possible in the policy formation process, and how this enabled for the emergence of a new advocacy coalition. This advocacy coalition consisted of the actors involved in the policy formation process, and these actors espoused the policy belief advocated by the change driver. However, as time went by, it became apparent that there also existed several veto players, which the change driver failed to engage, and who actively blocked the attempt to get the new policy documents on e&#8209;government adopted.  As a consequence, the policy formation process failed, despite that the municipality of Vasteras had exceptionally good conditions for improving the e&#8209;government policy agenda. This case study highlights the need for e&#8209;government&#8209;research to look beyond theoretical areas of technological science, and it illustrates the usefulness of theories from political science and change management when furthering the knowledge of e&#8209;government. It also points to the need for more processual studies on policy formation processes.

A Model of Fundamental Components for an e&#8209;Government Crowdsourcing Platform

Authors:

Jacques Ophoff
Abstract:
Abstract: Most e&#8209;Government implementations have resulted in failures with many implementations being one&#8209;way (government&#8209;to&#8209;citizen) and mainly informational (Dada, 2006; Cloete, 2012). However, advances in technology provide governments with the opportunity to engage with citizens using new methods, such as crowdsourcing. Successful commercial and open source software implementations of crowdsourcing have sparked interest in its potential use in the public sector. Brabham (2009) advocated for the use of crowdsourcing in the public sector to increase public participation and for governments to access citizens as a source of ideas and solutions. However, crowdsourcing lacks a theoretical and conceptual foundation (Geiger, et al., 2011; Pedersen, et al., 2013). Within e&#8209;Government there is also a lack of knowledge regarding the implementation of crowdsourcing platforms (Koch & Brunswicker, 2011). The main research questions is: How are crowdsourcing initiatives able to motivate citizen participation in e&#8209;Government?  A conceptual model of critical success factors for an e&#8209;Government crowdsourcing solution is presented, based on a comprehensive review of relevant literature. The model uses Self&#8209;Determination Theory as a basis to examine citizen motivation and the influence of incentives or rewards. The model also addresses system factors such as task clarity and types, management, and feedback. In addition it also examines effort and performance expectancy, and behavioural intention to use crowdsourcing through the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. The results of a questionnaire&#8209;based survey (n=295) testing the model indicated that some crowdsourcing concepts may not necessarily translate well when applied in public sector initiatives. System management and support, rules and feedback as well as the UTUAT constructs were identified as important factors. This research benefits future work by building a conceptual foundation for a potential e&#8209;Government crowdsourcing solution.

Abstract:
Abstract: Many public organizations still face big challenges regarding the use of performance management of information technology (IT&#8209;PM). We assume that one reason for this is the fact that they have characteristics of both the private and the public sector. So far, the literature differentiates only between private organizations and public administrations when taking into account the organizational effects on IT&#8209;PM. Public organizations are not taken into consideration. Besides, almost no research is done on how the characteristics of the three organizational forms affect the way IT&#8209;PM is implemented and used. We aim at designing a framework containing the influencing factors regarding IT&#8209;PM especially for public organizations. We base this framework on four major organizational attributes (objectives, stability and time horizon, complexity and managerial values) derived from the characteristics of IT&#8209;PM. In order to identify further influencing factors aligned with the organizational attributes, we enlarge the framework by findings of an additional literature review with a focus on the public sector. The assumption that public organizations have characteristics of both private organizations and public administrations was affirmed by the findings. We identified bureaucracy as an additional relevant organizational attribute. The other influencing factors were affirmed by the literature review. Our analysis presents a revised framework of organizational attributes and influencing factors regarding IT&#8209;PM in the public sector. Thus, it extends its understanding by differentiating its use in a particular organizational form. Public IT managers can use the findings to enhance the benefits of IT&#8209;PM and focus on relevant factors for its implementation, use and adaptation.

Abstract:
Abstract: This study examines three popular instruments used to assess good governance in response to initiatives promoting digitally&#8209;provided public services. It provides a comparative analysis of e&#8209;capabilities and trustworthiness in EU member states from benchmarks established by the European Commission, Transparency International and the United Nations in order to answer three questions: How do EU members stand when eGovernment capabilities are measured by multiple instruments? Does citizen online use and government website usability reflect user perceptions about transparency? And finally, is an overall ranking of eGovernment development associated with different measures of usage, transparency and public corruption? Comparing average scores between East and West EU member states, and conducting bivariate correlations of these various features, demonstrate that the demands placed upon member states to meet goals of the EU 2020 Digital Initiative are met to varying degree. This paper thus offers a unique perspective of eGovernment trends in Europe by integrating public and expert opinions on citizen interaction with government officials and completion of forms online, user centricity of national government websites, perceived levels of transparency in eGovernment and political corruption, and overall status of eGovernment development.

Abstract:
Abstract: A common identification and authentication space is one of the goals set in Europe⠒s Digital Agenda. Interoperability of electronic identities (eIDs) across Europe will facilitate mobility and cross&#8209;border e&#8209;business and therefore contribute to growth. Large Scale Pilots STORK and STORK 2.0 have designed a technical solution and are developing a model for offering cross&#8209;border eID use as service. A major challenge remains in growing acceptance for such a system by end users, service providers and national governments alike. This paper examines the different aspects influencing the long&#8209;term success of European identity federation, which enables cross&#8209;border eID use for accessing e&#8209;government and private services. A special emphasis is put on the value perspectives of the individual stakeholders and the public value assessment of the solution. Based on a literature review, it offers a framework for analysing acceptance criteria according to different stakeholder groups (governments, service providers, end users). It takes into account the trust component, the mutual influence of acceptance decisions and the importance of contextual factors influencing the actors⠒ choices. The discussion is based on a reflection of existing conceptual approaches in the field of technology acceptance in general and eID development in particular and draws on preliminary empirical data from the STORK 2.0 project. The paper outlines the challenges of creating a European interoperability solution, which allows a convergence with the development of national eID strategies and fits the value expectations of all stakeholders. In an organizational perspective, it touches upon requirements for creating an identity ecosystem with a network character but centralized services and decisions. In conclusion, the paper presents critical success factors for advanced collaboration between private service providers and government agencies across Europe on the subject of eID development. Thereby it assesses the current status of realization and outlines the challenges and o

Abstract:
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to identify research philosophy, methodologies and methods used in E&#8209;Government studies. The E&#8209;Government domain is interdisciplinary and consequently is likely to draw upon various research methodologies. It is important to identify methodologies used by researchers and practitioners from around the world because of the many lessons can be learnt from other researchers and practitioners and their methodologies.This paper attempts to examine all of research paper abstracts from the European Conference on E&#8209;Government (ECEG) Proceedings from 2007 to 2012 and International Conference on E&#8209;Government (ICEG) Proceedings from 2007 to 2010. This enables us to identify and classify a range of research methods and approaches used within the E&#8209;Government domain. Furthermore, the results can be categorised into research paradigm, research approach, research methodologies, research methods and way to conclusion. This paper uses graphics to represent the different methodologies and methods used as well as graphics of the top ten methodologies and methods. Comparison and evaluation of the results are made with previous works such as Heeks and Bailure (2007), Pedro and Bolivar (2010), also Bannister and Connoly (2010) and others. The results show the top ten methodologies in ECEG from 2007 to 2012 are (1) Case Study, (2) Not Clear Stated, (3) Survey, (4) Literature Review, (5) Questionnaire, (6) Empirical Approach, (7) Interview, (8) Quantitative and Qualitative, (9) Qualitative, (10) Statistical. Moreover, Top ten methodologies on ICEG from 2007 to 2010 are (1) Case Study, (2) Not Clear Stated, (3) Survey, (4) Questionnaire, (5) Interview, (6) Empirical Approach, (7) Quantitative Empirical, (8) Qualitative, (9) Extensive Review of Literature Review, (10) Qualitative and Quantitative. This examination of results shows that E&#8209;Government has a large variety of research philosophies, research methodologies and research methods from the extreme continuum positivist and social constructivist, pure qualitative, pure quantitative to m

E&#8209;SmartBox: A Decent Software and Hardware Tool to Enhance Public Service Efficiency and Sustainability

Abstract:
Abstract: The Ministry of Labour (MOL) is responsible for labour&#8209;related public services. The services include employment promotion, skill development, social security, the worker compensation fund, labour protection and welfare. These various services have been mandated to several departments and divisions under the MOL. Service receivers must know where to access a specific service since each service is provided in a different location. Especially in the countryside this becomes a significant difficulty since people do not know where to access a specific labour service. To enhance labour service accessibility MOL service counters had been established. The counters perform as a single window to access all kinds of labour&#8209;related public services. The service procedure starts from the service request, filling out a request form, providing required documents, finishing the service, and a satisfaction survey. This procedure takes averagely 20 &#8209; 30 minutes for each service access. Additionally, since more than 130 types of labour&#8209;related services have to be delivered, working staff have to be intensively trained to be able to deliver these services. Unfortunately, some working staff do not stay in their jobs long. They tend to quit their jobs for better ones. Training new staff to provide such a wide variety of services becomes an obstacle to delivering continual good services. E&#8209;SmartBox is a new concept designed by the MOL to solve the problems. It consists of two parts: a hardware part and a software part. The hardware part is a plastic box with a smartcard reader, a web camera and a key pad inside, and can be procured anywhere at low cost. All Thai people aged from 7 to 70 have citizen ID cards which are electronic smartcards. The software has been designed to retrieve personal data from the ID card, to fill and print request forms automatically and to provide a rapid satisfaction survey via the key pad. This greatly reduces the service procedure to less than five minutes. Additionally the software has been designed to assist the staff by providing

Abstract:
Abstract: A major problem in e&#8209;service development is the prioritization of the requirements of different stakeholders. The main stakeholders are governments and their citizens,all of whom have different and sometimes conflicting requirements. In this paper, the prioritization problem is addressed by combining a value&#8209;based approach with an illustration technique. This paper examines the following research question: How can multiple stakeholder requirements be illustrated from a value&#8209;based perspective in order to be prioritizable? We used an e&#8209;service development case taken from a Swedish municipality to elaborate on our approach. Our contributions are: 1) a model of the relevant domains for requirement prioritization for government, citizens, technology, finances and laws and regulations; and 2) a requirement fulfillment analysis tool (RFA) that consists of a requirement&#8209;goal&#8209;value matrix (RGV), and a calculation and illustration module (CIM). The model reduces cognitive load, helps developers to focus on value fulfillment in e&#8209;service development and supports them in the formulation of requirements. It also offers an input to public policy makers, should they aim to target values in the design of e&#8209;services.

Abstract:
Abstract: This study explores challenges faced by m&#8209;government services provided by the Ministry of Higher Education and Technical and Vocational Training Corporation in Saudi Arabia. By collecting data through surveys from students registered with the Ministry of Higher Education and Technical and Vocational Training Corporation and employees of IT and Communication Ministry in Saudi Arabia, this study shows that the high level of mobile penetration in the country offers an opportunity for Saudi Arabian government to offer mobile government services in the country. The results suggest that students find m&#8209;government services ineffective and expensive. However, employees believe that the effective implementation of m&#8209;government services is a feasible option and it would enhance the technological development in Saudi Arabia. Certain barriers to m&#8209;government adoption were identified, including the lack of necessary infrastructure and insufficient level of understanding amongst students. There is also a lack of the customization of mobile government services and lack of access to mobile technologies.

Abstract:
Abstract: The importance of e&#8209;government models lies in their offering a basis to measure and guide e&#8209;government. There is still no agreement on how to assess a government online. Most of the e&#8209;government models are not based on research, nor are they validated. In most countries, e&#8209;government has not reached higher stages of growth. Several scholars have shown a  confusing picture of e&#8209;government. What is lacking is an in&#8209;depth analysis of e&#8209;government models. Responding to the need for such an analysis, this study identifies the strengths and weaknesses of major national and local e&#8209;government evaluation models. The common limitations of most models are focusing on the government and not the citizen, missing qualitative measures, constructing the e&#8209;equivalent of a bureaucratic administration, and defining general criteria without sufficient validations. In addition, this study has found that the metrics defined for national e&#8209;government are not suitable for municipalities, and most of the existing studies have focused on national e&#8209;governments even though local ones are closer to citizens. There is a need for developing a good theoretical model for both national and local municipal e&#8209;government.

Abstract:
Abstract: In 2002 the cross&#8209;agency e&#8209;government initiative was established, quickly followed by the d&#8209;rulemaking program.  Excitement over digital opportunities from information communication technology (ITC) for citizens to participate in the agency rulemaking process has however been met with a mixed response.  In this essay we review popular thought surrounding technology and democratic participation, explain e&#8209;rulemaking and explore whether e&#8209;rulemaking has led to greater meaningful participation.  Factors such as the timing of the comments, administrative restraints in analyzing the comments and characteristics of the participants themselves are examined. We explain e&#8209;rulemaking and discuss this relatively new area of literature while critically examining the premise that e&#8209;rulemaking will lead to meaningful participation and engagement. In particular, we focus on the period of time from 2003 when the eRulemaking Program Management Office Launched the Regulations.gov website. Here we pose the following questions: Will greater access to the comment process in agency rulemaking increase the number of views expressed and improve the quality of the regulatory framework; and what will be the effect on democracy?

Abstract:
Abstract: Social media have proven to be  convenient tools that can be used by government authorities to increase openness and transparency, gain a greater understanding of public opinions, promote  the concept of eParticipation and give citizens a voice, as well as to reach many users at low cost. In addition, these social media have the unique feature of being able to update content frequently in real&#8209;time, in particular during emergencies, disasters, or special events. The purpose of this paper is to explore the adoption of Twitter by the government authorities in Saudi Arabia. It is a network analysis study seeking quantitative data. Ninety&#8209;three Saudi government authorities Twitter accounts were examined using web&#8209;based analytical tools. The general findings of the study indicate that the level of maturity of using Twitter by Saudi public authorities in general has not matured yet. Also, it is indicated that there is a significant difference between the performances of these accounts as only a few of them produced 53% of the total tweets. Natural and interactive accounts are more likely to have more followers. In addition, there is a misunderstanding of the role of using this new medium, as some authorities have more than one account and the collaboration between these accounts is limited in terms of being connected to each other.

Abstract:
Abstract: In order to investigate the low levels of citizen participation in Gov2.0, we used the theoretical lens of empowerment to better understand the use of Gov2.0. The paper includes an analysis of both management and psychology literatures; elaborates and discusses the conceptual issues of citizen empowerment, satisfaction, and participation in Gov2.0. A research model to enhance the understanding of citizen participation in Gov 2.0 is presented in this paper. The model includes four factors pertaining to empowerment theory: sense of impact, competence, meaningfulness and sense of control, which are believed to influence citizen participation in Gov2.0. A further positive outcome of citizen empowerment is higher levels of satisfaction with Gov 2.0. These suggestions make a strong case for citizen empowerment in Gov 2.0 to enhance the understanding of citizen participation in Gov. 2.0 as well as providing useful information for government agencies. Government agency decision&#8209;makers can also benefit from new insights into citizen participation and enhance citizen experiences with Gov2.0. The paper concludes with implications for theory and practice, and suggests avenues for future work.

The Practicality of Public Service Integration
Pages:
pp94&#8209;109
Authors:
Mohammed Alhusban
Abstract:
Abstract: The concept of public service integration constitutes the current tendency in the context of joined up government initiatives. Integration enables public agencies to share their objectives across organizational boundaries, whereby information and services can be shared among ministries and government entities in a way that avoid data redundancy, boost up the efficiency of internal government processes, increase employees⠒ productivity and ultimately provide citizen with high quality services and better level of governmental interaction. Jordanian government is now challenged to deliver an expanding set of services to a growing number of constituents whose expectations are in increase. Recent geopolitical, economic, health and social conditions are rapidly changing on the landscape, and have been impacted by the surrounding political unrest, resulting in Jordanian government having to overstretch its capabilities and cope. In this paper, the practicality of integrating online public services is investigated from government employee⠒s views, in specific ministries for certain services. Licensing services have been considered in this paper, and that because those services have been flagged as the most commonly used online services by the study participants, and currently offered through several dispersed portals and service providers. The study aimed at answering questions related to the practicality of integrating public services in Jordan. Five areas have emerged as major themes in the context of this paper: The misconception of the definition of public service integration with electronic Government, Drivers and Barriers from intraorganisational view, the readiness and willingness towards integration, and potential services where integration may occur. The preliminary results emerged from this paper show that there is a necessity to push further in the public service integration process, especially for specific services that require the involvement of several service providers. Integrating health and social services have been highlight

Mitja Dečman

Abstract:
Abstract: Although information technologys impact is evident in the everyday life of citizens and the private sector, the public sector has also gained and is gaining many benefits and could gain even more. Technology and information systems enable e&#8209;government processes to run more effectively and efficiently, changing organisations structure, people, processes, and regulations. Information systems (IS) are especially efficient in environments where a great amount of data is available and exact calculations are needed for many different stakeholders. Such an area in the public sector is obviously the area of taxation. These systems gather a great amount of data from different sources, they need to be reliable and, since a multitude of different users within and outside of the public sector are using them, they have to be user friendly. The aim of the research was to test one such system, called e&#8209;recovery, and the influence of different factors, including the following: user training, user documentation, user support, system usability, user interface, system speed, and specific system functionalities. Through empirical quantitative research, we surveyed more than 170 executors that use the e&#8209;recovery system every day. The findings of the statistical analysis of the individual measured indices and correlations between them provide support for these indices and show that the e&#8209;recovery system was well accepted among users and found to be very useful. Users evaluated the majority of the indices as above average but stressed the issue of inadequate training. Users do acknowledge that their work is faster due to e&#8209;recovery system use, but their motivation for work is not affected. The imperfections stressed most often were the occasional system failures, upgrade delays, and connection interruptions, since users access the system through the internet.

Abstract:
Abstract: Our research focuses on the question of acceptance of current e&#8209;government systems by elderly users. It describes how such systems should be designed and offered for this user group in order to provide an acceptable alternative to offline processes. In order to answer our research question, the research was structured into three phases along the development model of the ISO 9241&#8209;210. This enabled to identify not only the main factors of acceptance, but also the expectations of elderly users. Our research was conducted in parallel in Germany and Hungary in cooperation with the Fraunhofer FOKUS, the Federal Ministry of Interior, the Bundesdruckerei and the Corvinus University Budapest. The first phase provided results about the expectations and previous experience of the users with e&#8209;government systems. Our goal was to acquire information about the general experience of the age group with interactive applications so that a suitable test environment could be selected in the second phase of the research. The results made it possible to select an application in the second phase, which was used as a model in the remaining phases. The selected application was the AusweisApp of the electronic ID card. This was tested with 75 participants and a control group consisting of 20 students of the Humboldt&#8209;University. The obtain results allowed us to develop a generalised solution, the IGUAN guideline. This guideline makes a standardised approach to the usability improvement process possible. It contains the special requirements of elderly users, and a catalogue of criteria, which helps to develop an application in line with the set requirements. The third phase of our research was used a proof of concept for the IGUAN. The guideline was evaluated and tested with an iterative prototyping. The successful completion of this phase indicates that the IGUAN can be used to measurably increase the acceptance of e&#8209;government systems by elderly users. We could therefore demonstrate that improvements in the interface make e&#8209;government application possible which ar

Abstract:
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to analyze the strategic direction of the Brazilian e&#8209;Government Program from 2008 to 2014 associated with the Brazilian ranking on the United Nations e&#8209;Government Survey. Federal government strategic plans from 2008 to 2014 were analyzed based on three categories: e&#8209;services, e&#8209;administration (interoperability, integration; standardization; structuring systems) and e&#8209;democracy (open data and transparency; e&#8209;participation). Semi&#8209;structured interviews were conducted with fifteen government executives responsible for the planning and coordination of public policies in this sector. The research demonstrates that the Brazilian e&#8209;Government Program acquired a more important role in the Brazilian political arena after the protests of June 2013. The ⠜Gabinete Digital⠀ was created and reported directly to the Presidency of the Republic. It has successfully launched many e&#8209;government initiatives that were being developed but were not considered as a priority. Another research finding was the emphasis on increasing the supply of e&#8209;services. This was explicitly observed in government strategic planning starting in 2011. As a result, Brazil moved up 33 positions on the online index of the UN Survey from 2010 to 2012. The last presidential term was more focused on promoting interaction between government and society ⠍ through an increase of transparency, the use of open data by the states and municipalities, and providing access to public information. Brazil rose seven positions on the e&#8209;participation index between 2012 and 2014. Despite numerous initiatives, Brazil's e&#8209;government index ranking in the UN Survey is advancing very slowly and still didn⠒t reach the 45th global position it had in 2008, mainly because of low scores on the telecommunication infrastructure and the human capital indexes. These findings can also be verified in the evaluations of e&#8209;government initiatives presented. Our objective was to verify the convergence, effective follow up and achievement of the targets stipulated in the e&#8209;government stra

Abstract:
Abstract: The major aim of this paper is to explore and analyse the views of Malaysian public officials on how e&#8209;Procurement helps mitigate procurement fraud. While it is fully legitimate for private enterprises to bid for public works, in many cases there is inappropriate granting of public money to non&#8209;qualifying private business in a fraudulent manner. The visibility of fraud losses in the public sector has undermined the delivery of public services. Decrease of fraud incidents can improve the countryâ s growth in terms of infrastructure, by providing facilities to improve healthcare and education, to combat poverty, and to fund security and defence. This paper analyses the implementation of E&#8209;Government in Malaysia, which has transformed the public service into a dynamic and diverse environment for government activities. Electronic Procurement (e&#8209;Procurement) can be used as a tool to mitigate fraudulent activities in public organisations by ensuring accountability, transparency and the achievement of best value for money contracts. In this qualitative study, a political economy approach was used to investigate the social phenomenon. Documentary analysis and semi&#8209;structured interviews via the Snowball Sampling Method (SSM) were conducted for investigating public procurement fraud in Malaysia. The personal views of 13 procurement officers from various Malaysian government agencies were examined. Their perspectives, views and individual experiences shed light on how e&#8209;Procurement helps to alleviate public procurement fraud in Malaysia. The findings showed that that e&#8209;Procurement can (1) dispute political and economic forces in government purchasing processes, (2) manage demands and interference when rewarding government contracts, and (3) be used efficiently at the nexus of government and businesses. Thus, this study has a number of practical implementations and contributions based on the experience and views on e&#8209;Procurement by Malaysian public officials. It can also facilitate policy makers, enforcement agencies and researchers in understanding

Abstract:
Abstract: An effective strategy is critical for the successful development of e&#8209;Government. The leading nations in the e&#8209;Government rankings include Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland. Their leading role makes them interesting to study when looking for reasons to successful e&#8209;Government. The purpose of this research paper is to describe the e&#8209;Government development strategies of Nordic countries, which rank highly on the international stage. In particular it aims to study the foci of these strategies. The approach is a document study of the e&#8209;Government development strategies of Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland was carried out using a qualitative content analysis inductive method. The results show that the major focus of Nordic e&#8209;Government strategies is on public sector reforms. Other focus areas include economic reforms and, to a lesser extent, e&#8209;Democracy efforts. Sweden, Finland and Norway have set ambitious policy goals in order to achieve global leadership in e&#8209;Government development. In response to the question posed by this papers title, we can say that Nordic e&#8209;Government strategies, except for Norway, focus more on reforming public sector services than on economic reforms.  E&#8209;Democracy reforms are hardly focused on at all. Practical implications: Public sector policy makers can relate their policy foci to some of the more successful e&#8209;Government countries in the world. Research implications/originality is that this paper can apart from the findings also provide a means on how to identify the actual foci of a countrys e&#8209;Government policy.

Abstract:
Abstract: This paper aims to identify themes, trends, research philosophies, methodologies and methods used in E&#8209;Government studies. This research uses a novel structure literature review method to capture the evolving research focus in the E&#8209;Government literature. It examines all abstracts from the European Conference on E&#8209;Government (ECEG) papers from 2007 to 2012 and International Conference on E&#8209;Government (ICEG) papers from 2007 to 2010. This paper also compares previous research covering themes and models of E&#8209;Government research. The research findings are: 1) case study and potential case study is dominant methods, 2) there are various research philosophy, methodology and methods on e&#8209;government field, and 3) e&#8209;government is evolving over time and is maturing as a discipline. An analysis also shows lack of works covering development of theory in e&#8209;government domain. This paper provides further contribution by using a novel approach for conducting a structured literature review, based on evaluating abstracts and key words, and in a corresponding method to method to validate classification of themes that emerge using focus group discussion sessions.

Risk and Decision in Collaborative e&#8209;Government: An Objectives&#8209;Oriented Approach

Authors:
Leif Sundberg
Abstract:
Abstract. Developing e&#8209;services in the public sector is a demanding task that involves a variety of stakeholders and values. Further complexity is added by organizational and institutional challenges, especially when specialized government agencies are expected to collaborate to create seamless, integrated services. This paper focuses on decision making and risk analysis in two Swedish collaborative e&#8209;Government cases. Empirical material consists of semi&#8209;structured interviews and project documentation, which are analyzed using an objectives&#8209;oriented Logical Framework Approach (LFA). The results highlight two factors that influence the outcomes of the projects; governance for collaboration and financial models for distributing resources between government agencies. When these formal support mechanisms are not provided, they become risks for the projects and create uncertainties in decision processes. While the studied government context has matured enough to develop fully functional platforms for e&#8209;services, these uncertainties become issues when public values are to be measured and evaluated. The paper concludes by suggesting the use of public values as objectives together with measurable indicators in order to create a common language for decision making and risk management across government agencies.

Abstract:
Abstract: This study evaluated the extent to which current status of e&#8209;government implementation in Nigeria conforms to the national IT policy strategy. The study is based on content analysis of the official websites of the thirty six states and the federal capital territory of the country. It focuses on the content, functional and construction features of the websites. It was found that, out of the thirty six states, only twenty&#8209;three (64 percent) had websites and mostly provide textual information; few provide downloadable digital documents and functional online interactions. We recommend that, in addition to the National IT policy, Nigerian government needs to have an established guideline for its e&#8209;government implementation and NITDA needs to be more proactive in its duty of monitoring IT policy implementation. The site designers should acknowledge the importance of government websites as the main channels for information dissemination, for facilitating citizens interaction with government and for transforming government operations. Thus, the websites must be more than static notice boards but be function&#8209;oriented, dynamic and interactive.

Abstract:
Abstract: With the emergence of Web 2.0 technology, governments are able to deliver quality services and fully satisfy the needs of their citizens. Despite the importance of this emerging trend, identifying and attracting an audience for government&#8209;affiliated social media (SM) services has proved to be a significant challenge. The figures for public participation in government2.0 remain below expectations. This paper is one of the few attempts to identify those factors affecting citizens decisions to use SM platforms as a means for communication with their government. To develop a new model of SM adoption, this research study is based on a literature review, and will extend the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model by integrating cultural factors identified by the Hofstede model (masculinity, uncertainty avoidance, power distance and collectivism) and factors related to the trust and motivational model. This paper has created a comprehensive taxonomy of those factors that influence the adoption of SM among citizens, while providing a list of hypotheses for evaluating the significance of these factors.

Abstract:
Abstract: This article examines the e&#8209;availability and e&#8209;accessibility of financial documents through county websites in the United States (U.S.). E&#8209;availability and e&#8209;accessibility of financial documents supports a stakeholder&#8209;centric approach for evaluating performance and fiscal conditions of county governments, while also promoting democratic values of transparency and accountability. Previous research addresses e&#8209;availability and e&#8209;accessibility for cities, only one analysis reviews popular reports in both cities and counties, and only one study exists that exclusively focuses on the 100 most populous U.S. counties. Our review extends earlier research by examining 237 U.S. counties, up to five in each of the 48 states with county governments. Additionally, this research makes a limited comparison with an earlier study to indicate changes in the e&#8209;availability and e&#8209;accessibility of financial documents over a four&#8209;year period.  Using systematic sampling and content analysis, this study contributes to fuller understanding of the significance of financial documents as a feature of e&#8209;government, while reviewing more counties and highlighting variations among counties of differing population sizes. This research also conducted Chi&#8209;square tests to examine the relationship of the variables, and the value of Cramér's V was calculated to measure the strength of the relationship between the variables. In addition to finding variations in the e&#8209;availability and e&#8209;accessibility of financial documents among counties of different population sizes, this analysis also demonstrates dramatic e&#8209;availability improvements for two of the three selected financial documents while noting a modest decrease in the overall e&#8209;accessibility of financial documents on county websites. After reporting and analyzing the findings, research limitations are disclosed, and recommendations are offered to advance the state&#8209;of&#8209;practice and for further studies. This form of benchmarking may assist other local governments in the U.S. with improving their websites, while internationally this analysis supports developing countries with refining their e&#8209;government strategies by improving online information disclosure.

Warm Experts in the age of Mandatory e&#8209;Government: Interaction Among Danish Single Parents Regarding Online Application for Public Benefits

Abstract:
Abstract: Citizens adoption of e&#8209;government channels has been the focus of both academic studies and public policy for over a decade. Current efforts seek to reduce citizens interaction with caseworkers through traditional channels in favor of increased use of e&#8209;government self&#8209;service channels. To increase adoption rates and reduce the costs of public administration, the Danish e&#8209;government strategy has made e&#8209;government self&#8209;service channels mandatory thereby attempting to turn citizens into their own caseworkers. The channel choice branch of e&#8209;government studies how citizens and businesses choose interaction channels in a public service encounter. Until now, studies of citizens channel choice have taken place at the level of the individual and ignored the influence of group processes. Moreover, although the importance of digital literacy has been widely recognized in relation to citizen channel choice and e&#8209;government adoption, citizens knowledge of public administration and administrative processes has received less attention. To cover this gap, we conducted a qualitative study of how citizen&#8209;to&#8209;citizen interaction influences channel choice in public service encounters, and how citizens share advice for seeking public benefits. The study entailed five focus group discussions and nine follow&#8209;up individual semi&#8209;structured interviews with Danish single parents who receive public benefits. We employ domestication theory and the concept of the warm expert to inform our analysis. Our findings show that the interaction and advice sharing among citizens extends beyond the choice of channels and also covers how the selected channels are used and evaluated. In addition to helping each other with how to use e&#8209;government self&#8209;service channels, citizens also share practices for negotiating with public authorities. This negotiation requires the use of traditional channels and concerns areas such as increasing the likelihood of being granted benefits and ways of getting around the mandatory requirement for e&#8209;government self&#8209;service channels. Based on our findings we present contributions to the channel choice field and offer suggestions for how to expand and update a previous channel choice process model.

Abstract:
Abstract: Public sector organizations are supposed to increase productivity by large&#8209;scale investments in IT. This research investigates the municipalities capabilities to increase productivity through IT investments, and what major challenges must be overcome to do so. The research identifies several problems that reduce productivity gains. These problems persist even though they might seem trivial and easily remedied. They are however symptoms of a more general challenge: Difficulties achieving a proper alignment between IT and organizational processes. This alignment gap is related to the way service production is regulated and organized and the way IT is developed and acquired, the lack of local technology and task control that emerges and the resulting lack of managed coordination between task and technology design.

Abstract:
This paper reports on data collected from an anonymous survey on perceptions of the Australian public towards using a mobile internet e&#8209;voting platform (N = 295). It is the first such study conducted in an Australian context by an academic institution, which allows this research to be approached with a sense of impartiality. Our society has become rapidly fuelled by the mobilization of interactions and services. As the society becomes increasingly wirelessly connected, these mobile platforms are expected to provide an untapped universal medium by which paper based elections can be complemented or even "upgraded" to digital elections. This research is the first paper in a study which will be focusing on internet e&#8209;voting, specifically the utilisation of mobility devices within Australia. As with any research, context shapes the direction and outcome goals. Internet e&#8209;Voting (and research pertaining to) has gained momentum over recent years. Though there has been much research done in this field, there was been a gap in findings when dealing with Australian and mobility context, however similarities can be drawn from these related studies. The way the Australian context differentiates itself in one instance is Compulsory Voting. Utilising the findings from this initial study, we intend to provide a baseline from which our research can be further analysed and in turn will allow the derivation of hypotheses leading to creation of a user acceptance model towards utilisation of a mobile internet e&#8209;voting platform during an Australian election. Survey respondents were overall more in favour of using mobile internet e&#8209;voting (75.25%), with more respondents requiring greater information about the technology (15.93%) rather than being against its use (8.82%). The top appeals of the platform were towards mobility (91.40%), verifiability (72.90%) and speed (72.50%), with the top concerns towards manipulation (75.10%), retrieval (65.30%) and monitoring (63.20%) of casted votes by malicious parties or software.

Authors:

Abstract:
This paper presents the results of research aimed at analysing the usage of Facebook as the most popular social networking site among 112 Slovene state administration organizations. Private entities use social networks to enhance their visibility, interact with clients, and for (related) marketing and sales of their products and services. Social networks also represent the potential for increased interaction between public administration and its users. However, statistics on the usage of social networks in public organizations is scarce. The methodology of our research is based on 16 indicators measuring usage, engagement, multi&#8209;channel features, and multi&#8209;media content. The results reveal that only a few organizations have established their Facebook presence, and for most of them considerable room for improvement has been identified in terms of usage of Facebook as a social network with the highest potential of reach and engagement in the number of its users. An extensive literature review in the field of social media usage in public administrations worldwide is also provided.

Abstract:
Tax administrations need to become more efficient due to a growing workload, higher demands from citizens, and, in many countries, staff reduction and budget cuts. The novel field of analytics has achieved successes in improving efficiencies in areas such as banking, insurance and retail. Analytics, which is often described as an extensive use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, explanatory and predictive models, and fact&#8209;based management to drive decisions and actions (Davenport and Harris, 2007: 7), fits well in tax administrations, that typically have access to large volumes of data. In this paper we will answer the question how analytics contributes to a Compliance Risk Management approach – a major trend in taxpayer supervision in the last decade. The main tasks within compliance risk management include risk identification, risk analysis, prioritization, treatment, and evaluation. The answer of the research question gives more insight in what we can expect from analytics, and will assist tax administrations that want to improve their analytical capabilities. Attention is paid as well to limitations of analytics. Findings include that over half of the activities in taxpayer supervision can be supported by analytics. Additionally, a match is presented between supervision activities and specific analytical techniques that can be applied for these activities. The article also contains a short case study of the Netherlands Tax and Customs Administration on selection of VAT refunds with analytical techniques.

Abstract:
E&#8209;government implementation has received extra attention as a new way to increase the development of a country. International organizations such as the ITU and the United Nations provide strategic guidance to overcome the challenges of ICT use. Yet, the development of ICT use in developing countries is still very low. Researchers are contributing to support successful implementation with models and theories that conceptualize the complex situation. This paper extends the DPSIR&#8209;based e&#8209;government conceptual framework into the direction of implementation strategies. The main focus is on improving stakeholder involvement during requirements engineering. Object Role Modeling (ORM) was used (1) to develop a semi&#8209;natural language (controlled language) that is understandable both for domain stakeholders and system analysts and (2) to make a common description of the application domain in this language. The proposed model can be used to construct quantitative simulation tools to be used by policy makers.

Abstract:
Various types of inter&#8209;organisational systems (IOSs) are emerging to facilitate information exchange between companies and governments. These systems are developed in constellations of stakeholders who impose different and even opposing requirements on the information sharing arrangements. Yet which determinants shape the selected information sharing arrangement is not clear. The present research investigated such determinants through a review of IOS implementation literature and an in&#8209;depth case study. The literature review resulted in a list of determinants that were categorised using the Technological, Organisational and Environmental (TOE) framework. These determinants were analysed in detail for the Standard Business Reporting implementation in the Netherlands. The findings suggest that an information sharing arrangement should be conceptualised by both its architecture and its governance, as they are mutually dependent. In the case study, trust, power, the involvement of major public organisations, compatibility and interoperability were found to be the main determinants influencing the shaping of the information sharing arrangement.

Citizen&#8209;centric Perspective on the Adoption of E&#8209;Government in the Philippines

Authors:

Abstract:
Information and communications technologies (ICTs) and the Internet are widely used as strategic means to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of governments and the accessibility of government information and services to citizens. In the Philippines, the government has prepared elaborate plans to enhance implementation of e&#8209;government in the country. Thus, it is only fitting to investigate the state of the adoption of e&#8209;government in the country not only to monitor progress of its implementation but to further improve access of citizens to government information and services. However, due to the inherent disparities in socio&#8209;demography, access to ICTs, Internet use as well as in the patterns of Internet use, and awareness of available e&#8209;government services in developing countries such as the Philippines, the adoption of e&#8209;government by citizens in the country is faced with major challenges (e.g., inequitable access to information and government services, widening of the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged groups). In order to uncover the state of adoption and citizens’ perception of e&#8209;government in the Philippines, this study analyzed primary data collected through a national&#8209;scale survey conducted as a result of collaboration with a private social research institution based in the Philippines. Descriptive and inferential statistics were employed to describe the state of adoption of e&#8209;government in the Philippines and examine the effects of socio&#8209;demographic factors; access to ICTs and the Internet; and attitudes toward e&#8209;government on the awareness and adoption of e&#8209;government in the country. The study further validates the findings of other empirical studies on e&#8209;government adoption found in literature.

Abstract:
Previous research on information quality and organizations performance focuses on private sectors and pays little attention to governments and public organizations. To the best of the researchers’ knowledge, e&#8209;Government success literature has rarely investigated information quality as a contributor to the success of e&#8209;Government initiatives in Kuwait. This paper aims to understand the factors that may influence or hinder for enabling e&#8209;Government strategic benefits in Kuwait. Data were collected from 31 employees through one&#8209;on&#8209;one interviews at three e&#8209;Government Kuwaiti agencies namely, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Finance and Public Authority for Civil Communication. The study findings revealed that several themes (i.e. information quality, strategic benefits, and institutional values) were observed to achieve better e&#8209;Government Benefits. The research also reveals some new drivers (Cost saving and customer satisfaction) and barriers (e.g. Nepotism and Wasta) to improving organizational performance. These results and their implications to both theory and practice are described.

Which Factors Can Affect e&#8209;Public Procurement Adoption by Private Firms? The Case of Belgium

Authors:

Abstract:
Firms are the main users of e&#8209;public procurement applications (hereinafter e&#8209;procurement), so their acceptance to adopt this technology is a crucial element in its successful implementation. Nonetheless, very few studies have focused on this subject. This article aims to identify and analyse the factors affecting private companies’ adoption of e&#8209;procurement. Relying on several solid theories in the field of acceptance and adoption of innovation, namely the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Diffusion of Innovation theory (DOI), the Technology, Organization, Environment framework (TOE) and the Iacovou et al. model, we constructed a research model that included the most important potential factors that can influence this variable. Our model was tested according to the survey method. Based on the data received from 760 Belgian firms spread over a wide range of economic activities, we identified five main variables that could explain about 33.5 % of the total variability of e&#8209;procurement adoption by firms: size, attitude towards change, competitive pressure, trading partners’ pressure and organizational readiness. In contrast, we did not find any significant relationship between the relative advantages and e&#8209;procurement adoption. Finally, the implications for theory and practice are discussed.

From Assumptions to Artifacts: Unfolding e&#8209;participation within Multi&#8209;level Governance

Abstract:
The role of technological innovation within the context of governance processes is often embraced with rhetorical enthusiasm and seen as a de facto enabler for democratic decision&#8209;making. Underpinning this enthusiasm is the leap of faith made from transparency to trust, from complexity to coherence. The belief that using new tools for e&#8209;participation can generate dramatic transformation in public sector redesign and result in societal benefits is heralded as a shift towards public innovation. It is precisely this belief that we examine in this paper. We start our investigation by providing a conceptualization of what e&#8209;participation means within the context of multi&#8209;level governance. By using a cross case comparison of two European research projects, we provide an empirical base upon which we can examine the process of e&#8209;participation and the implications of digital e&#8209;participation tools for various levels of governance and public accountability. Furthermore we provide an interdisciplinary contribution in understanding the gap between what technological innovation makes possible and the acceptance or openness on the part of decision makers to embrace citizen input within policy processes.

Systematic Literature Review on Enterprise Architecture in the Public Sector

Abstract:
Enterprise architecture (EA) is an approach to improve the alignment between the organization’s business and their information technologies. It attempts to capture the status of the organizations’ business architecture, information resources, information systems, and technologies so that the gaps and weaknesses in their processes and infrastructures can be identified, and development directions planned. For this reason, EA has become a popular approach also in the public sector to increase their efficiency and ICT utilization. Yet researchers have largely ignored this context, and it seems that quite little is known about how EA is developed, implemented, or adapted in different countries and in the public sector. We thus conducted a systematic literature review to identify the major research topics and methods in studies focusing on public sector EA. We analyzed 71 identified articles from the past 15 years. Our analysis shows that the development viewpoint, case studies in developed countries, and local settings seem to form mainstream EA research in the public sector. Taken together, it seems that public sector EA is scattered, and there is no strong, single research stream. Instead the researchers conduct local case studies. This means the knowledge on EA development, implementation or adaptation, their challenges and best practices does not accumulate. There is consequently a need for more research in general, and targeted research in some specific segments.

Abstract:
It has been widely accepted in Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICT4D) literature that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can foster socio&#8209;economic development, however, the process through which this occurs remains unclear. Historically, there has only been a limited focus on evaluating the impact of ICT projects vis&#8209;a&#8209;vis development, and little concrete analysis of these initiatives in terms of their long&#8209;term effects. In this paper, we evaluate the role ICT education and training play in poverty reduction and economic empowerment using an ICT4D Case study of Jigawa State Government, Nigeria. The State Government funded an initiative aimed to develop 500 ICT professionals annually between the year 2001 to 2012. This was to be attained through local and overseas training, as well as the activation of computerisation within certain government operations, such as financial management, procurement and payroll. In our research, we employed Richard Heek’s Design&#8209;Reality Gap model and Sen’s Capability Approach (CA) framework as a theoretical lens to inform the study and furthermore as an evaluative space for ICT4D impact assessment. A broadly interpretative approach was adopted within the Case Study context. Data collection was conducted using multiple sources including surveys, document analysis, and interviews with project beneficiaries and key policy makers. The primary contribution of this paper is in providing greater insights into the role of ICT Education and Training towards poverty reduction and economic empowerment. Furthermore, it aims to exhibit a unique and novel combination of Sen’s Capability Approach and Heek’s Design&#8209;Reality Gap Model in examining ICT4D policy outcome, which will provide significant insights on how the gap between policy objectives and the outcome might be eliminated.

E&#8209;government in Rwanda: Implementation, Challenges and Reflections

Abstract:
E&#8209;government is currently high on the agenda in many developing countries (DCs). While e&#8209;government is well&#8209;established in many developed countries it is new to least developed countries. Countries that start implementing e&#8209;government today can benefit from easy import of modern technologies, but adaptation to local conditions and the organizational change that is required cannot be imported, but must be developed at home. By using examples of an ongoing initiative by the Government of Rwanda to digitalize all G2C and G2B into a single window platform, the current study investigated the important challenges in the implementation of e&#8209;government  in Rwanda. An interpretive case study was followed. Data was collected through interviews and participatory observations during August to December 2015. Data analysis was inductive, the analysis method was content analysis, and the coding followed open&#8209;coding. NVivo software has been used to handle data and facilitate the analysis. The study found six overarching categories of aspects that challenge a successful implementation of e&#8209;government in Rwanda. They include information infrastructure for e&#8209;government, social inclusion, governance, management, trust in the new system, and languages. However,  challenges to e&#8209;government implementation should not be taken as of the same extent, neither their degree of mitigation. Rather, they influence and are influenced by various contextual factors which include political support, nature of the e&#8209;government project, implementation strategies, human and socio&#8209;economic development, existing information infrastructure, and operational capabilities. Having said this, we also argue that countries should learn from one another of their experiences, success stories, and mistakes. Despite a number of associated challenges, the adopted public&#8209;private partnership (PPP) approach to e&#8209;Government implementation in Rwanda might indeed seem as a suitable catalyst for e&#8209;government success in the country.

Beyond Information&#8209;Sharing. A Typology Of Government Challenges And Requirements For Two&#8209;Way Social Media Communication With Citizens

Abstract:
Despite great advances in ICT, social media, participatory platforms and mobile apps, we seem to still be locked in the one&#8209;way communication “paradigm” where information flows unilaterally from government to citizens and seldom vice&#8209;versa. As a result, citizens are more receivers rather than conscious producers of information, data, ideas, solutions and decisions in the context of public policies. By means of an extensive literature review, this paper aims to explore the challenges on the part of government that prevent the transition to more dialogic governance and identifies the requirements for a meaningful application of social media for this purpose. The paper contributes to the literature in three ways:  i) redefining a typology of social media&#8209;based citizens&#8209;government relationship; ii) clarifying the difference between challenges and risks of social media application by governments and identifying a typology of government challenges; and iii) identifying government requirements as a conditio sine&#8209;qua non for overcoming these challenges upfront, enabling more effective two&#8209;way interactions between governments and citizens. The paper concludes with discussion of implications and directions for further research.

Abstract:
This paper examines the challenges of enterprise architecture (EA) adoption in public sector organisations. So far, demonstrating the benefits of EA has appeared difficult in this context, and the results in transforming public sector remain modest: Both the penetration and the maturity of EA appear rather low. In the academia, however, the adoption of EA has gained less interest than the EA development and methodologies. Hence, there is a need for research on what are the challenges of EA adoption, and how to overcome them. This paper presents the results of an expert survey on the challenges of EA adoption in the Finnish public sector. The analysis of quantitative data, supported with a qualitative data, reveals three interrelated factors: Resistance towards EA, Relevant EA goals, and the EA practices in use. Managing the identified key issues classified in these three broad concepts would be the prerequisite for institutionalising EA and making it a legitimate practice. The findings extend the current knowledge of the public sector EA with practicable ideas how to increase the level of penetration and maturity.

Abstract:
The aim was to investigate whether there is a relationship between degree of e&#8209;government in Swedish municipalities and perceived satisfaction among citizens generally. This is a large&#8209;scale quantitative study based on valid and reliable Swedish national surveys. Based on these surveys, a new comprehensive index for measuring “degree of digitalization” was constructed. Citizen satisfaction was measured using established indices covering three dimensions: satisfaction with living in the municipality, satisfaction with performance of government activities (delivered services), and satisfaction with transparency and influence. The results show that there is a relationship between the degree of digitalization in a municipality and the perceived satisfaction among its citizens. The degree of digitalization is related to all three dimensions of citizen satisfaction. Additionally, this study indicates that the strength of this relationship is in parity with or even stronger than the relationship between citizen satisfaction and other crucial factors such as educational level and median income.

Exploring User Participation Practice in Public E&#8209;Service Development – Why, How and in Whose Interest?

Abstract:
User participation is seen as an important enabler for successful public e&#8209;service development. However, at the same time development of public e&#8209;services is still often characterised by an internal government perspective with little consideration for external users’ perspectives. This paper challenges the overly positive attitude that is surrounding user participation in e&#8209;government research. The paper aims to illustrate and problematize various aspects that influence why, how, and in whose interest user participation is conducted in public e&#8209;service development. First, via a literature review, we identify a set of dimensions for critically exploring how, why, and in whose interest user participation is conducted in public e&#8209;service development projects. Second, we use these dimensions in order to characterise and analyse three empirical public e&#8209;service development cases in order to test the utility, usefulness, and feasibility of the identified dimensions. Our findings highlight the importance of questioning and elaborating on the motives behind user participation (the why) in public e&#8209;service development. We also identify two basic forms of how user participation is addressed in public e&#8209;service development projects: 1) veneered participation, and 2) ad&#8209;hoc participation. Furthermore, we argue that any decisions made regarding user participation in public e&#8209;service development should be based on conscious and informed choices concerning why user participation is needed and what it may bring for different stakeholders and their interests.

Abstract:
In this study, the relationship between task characteristics and business intelligence (BI) success is empirically tested on a business intelligence system in an e&#8209;Government context in Denmark. The purpose of the study is to investigate which tasks contribute to BI success. A total of 1.351 end users replied to the questionnaire, and the response rate was 32%. In this study, task compatibility and task difficulty have a substantial relationship with user satisfaction. The relationship between task significance and use was also substantial, as well as the relationship between user satisfaction and individual impact. The model was a good fit, having a relatively high determination coefficient and predictive relevance. Therefore, the study determined that tasks are important factors contributing to BI success.

Bringing Light into the Shadows: A Qualitative Interview Study on Citizens’ Non&#8209;Adoption of e&#8209;Government

Authors:
Bettina Distel
Abstract:
Despite the growing availability of e&#8209;government services, citizens are still reluctant to use them. Prior research has mostly focused on investigating reasons for e&#8209;government use. Why individuals refrain from using these services seems to be of less scientific interest. The present study sets out to reveal what barriers to e&#8209;government adoption citizens perceive. A qualitative and explorative interview study was conducted with 18 citizens in Germany to better understand how citizens perceive e&#8209;government and what keeps them from using it. The study yields twelve different barriers to e&#8209;government adoption among which no need to use/rare usage of public services, no personal counsellor, and perceptions of convenience are the most important. The results suggest that the characteristics of the services themselves are highly influential for the decision to not use e&#8209;government. In contrast, technological shortcomings like data security or a lack of usability only play a subordinate role.

Translating Telephone Calls To Spreadsheets: Generating Knowledge on Citizen Multichannel Behavior in Collaboration With Caseworkers
Pages:
pp106&#8209;118
Authors:
Christian Østergaard Madsen
Abstract:
Public organizations increasingly seek to digitalize their services, and migrate citizens from traditional communication channels towards digital self&#8209;service channels. In Denmark, digital communication and self&#8209;service channels are mandatory for public organizations, citizens and businesses. Denmark has the highest share of citizens who use digital channels to interact with public authorities in the EU. However, the use of traditional channels remains high, and occurs among adopters and non&#8209;adopters of digital channels alike. Within the multichannel management stream of e&#8209;government research, there is a methodological gap in how knowledge can be generated on citizen multichannel behavior, and why citizens continue to use traditional channels. Practitioners need this knowledge to improve administrative efficiency and citizens’ satisfaction with digital services. Therefore, this paper presents a study of how scholars, practitioners, and caseworkers collaborated to generate data on citizen multichannel behavior. The study occurred in the public authority Udbetaling Danmark, where caseworkers periodically use an IT system to log incoming calls. First, a draft version of a classification scheme was created from co&#8209;listening to calls and contextual interviews with citizens. To ensure engagement and a common understanding of the classification categories, the scheme was co&#8209;developed with caseworkers in three iterations. Observations, joint discussions and interviews were used to uncover problems related to caseworkers’ understanding of the scheme, and identify technical and practical problems related to its use. With the new classification scheme, the share of logged calls increased from 10 &#8209; 50 percent to 90 &#8209; 95 percent. Moreover, the collaboration led to a closer understanding of citizens’ problems among the involved actors and a willingness for future collaboration to improve the services. This paper contributes to the multichannel management field of e&#8209;government and to practitioners by presenting a method for how knowledge can be generated on citizen multichannel behavior in collaboration with caseworkers.

Abstract:
Gathering information to improve decision making during crises is the core business of crisis information officers. In this paper a case study is presented, along with an analysis of the influence of information on crisis management in order to improve crisis response. This analysis shows that interaction between the activities of i. leading crisis response and ii. obtaining a good information position is required in order to improve the effectiveness of the crisis organisation. Interaction between the two is necessary to optimise and tailor the information position in a specific situation, resulting in situational awareness.By combining the efforts of crisis information officers, developers of the Dutch crisis management system (LCMS) and two European FP7 research projects, a balancing platform was provided to study the complexity of cross border and cross sector information sharing. Over a hundred officers and experts from more than 10 countries had gathered to see the results of that action. The officers and the water experts also saw added value in using the instrument for preparative discussions and meetings to explore each other’s domain and organisational concerns. The combination of cascade modelling, applied semantics, National base&#8209;registry data, and European satellite imaging, was well received by the Dutch and German crisis teams, and by the Dutch command and National Security Council. The application of standards, a controlled vocabulary of icons and symbols has been documented in a guideline that will be made a mandatory Directive by the Dutch National Security Council. The combination of semantic reasoning and Geographic search has been translated into a W3C/OGC best practice.

Different But Still The Same? How Public And Private Sector Organisations Deal with New Digital Competences
Pages:
pp127&#8209;135
Authors:
Sara Hofmann

Abstract:
One of the greatest challenges that digitalisation brings along for the public sector is the need to equip their employees with digital competences. Since private sector companies are often assumed more progressive in exploiting digital media, it seems worthwhile for the public sector to understand how the need for digital competences is addressed by the private sector. However, the public sector needs to be careful before transferring solutions from the private sector one&#8209;on&#8209;one as both sectors exhibit various differences. Our aim in this study is therefore, to analyse which digital competences are needed by employees in both sectors and how the employees are equipped with these competences. In doing so, we have conducted 17 interviews in German public and private sector organisations. Our results exhibit only marginal differences between public and private sector organisations. Furthermore, we find that rather than being able to handle IT, the most important competences in the digital era are soft skills such as time and self&#8209;management as well as to understand the impact of digitalisation in general. In the private sector, analytical skills are furthermore important for developing new business opportunities. In order to equip employees with the required competences, training plays an important role in both sectors. Based on our results, we enhance an existing framework of digital competences by adding the dimension impact awareness in order to provide for the required ability to evaluate the impact of digitalisation on processes and activities outside of the digital world.

Developing Administrative Law into Handling the Challenges of Digital Government in Denmark

pp136&#8209;146

Ayo Næsborg-Andersen
Abstract:
Denmark is far in developing Digital Government. Two essential challenges have, however, emerged. First, the use of information and communication technology (ICT) has caused unlawful administration in some areas due to deficient and faulty programming, in some cases violating the very core of rule of law. This unwanted side effect of digitalisation has been counteracted by a development of new principles of Danish administrative law; administrative law by design and the requirement for a good administration impact assessment. Administrative law by design imposes a duty on public authorities to apply a value&#8209;based approach and to ensure relevant legislation and unwritten principles of public administrative law are embedded into the design of ICT. Good administration impact assessment entails a requirement for mapping all relevant legislation and principles of administrative law as part of the development of a given technology, if it is to be used by public authorities. Second, a major challenge is the skidding of control and insight as the digitalisation transition progresses and the technologies used develops. Some Danish authorities have already lost the oversight, the knowledge and the control of the systems used within their areas of administration, as also described in this article. During the summer of 2017 Danish administrative law might have adjusted to this challenge as well. The Parliamentary Ombudsman stated that in some cases the explicit acceptance of the democratically legitimised parliament, in other words legislation, is needed, if private companies are to develop and operate technologies used in the public sector. The aim of this article is to give a brief description of these two challenges caused by digitalisation and to hopefully serve as inspiration for others facing similar challenges and to give a more comprehensive insight in the subsequent development of Danish administrative law.

Abstract:
Information and communication technologies (ICT) are important for people with disability in their day&#8209;to&#8209;day life, as they offer possibilities and opportunities for these people to enjoy a range of new social interactions. In this article we examine the affordances of different types of social media and discuss the dichotomy between simplicity of use and social presence. Further, we discuss the implications of these affordances for development of public e&#8209;services aimed at improving the social life of people with disabilities. Our findings show that virtual worlds are the most engaging medium. However, other social media can to some extent offer the same affordances for people with disability. We suggest that future research should empirically investigate the affordances offered by social media to people with disability and find ways of combining the affordance perspective with usability studies to fill the void in the category high social presence/low complexity of use. Finally, we present suggestions for development of an e&#8209;service that can fill this gap and create a viable social medium for people with disability.

Abstract:
Until now, explanations of citizens’ online behaviors in the Western world have been scarce, with accounts of analyses of citizens’ behaviors in authoritarian governance regimes in the East being even scarcer. This study contributes to the understanding of which factors contribute to citizens’ use of social media in state&#8209;citizen communication patterns in authoritarian governance regimes, with a focus on Chinese citizens’ use of Sina Weibo microblogs. Based on the analysis of 1572 questionnaires collected from citizens living in Hunan (People’s Republic of China), the study quantifies the factors that impact (1) Chinese citizens’ intentions to use Sina Weibo and (2) actual use of Sina Weibo in state&#8209;citizen communication patterns. Results indicate that peer pressure and trust in individual civil servants positively impacts use of Government Sina Weibo microblogs by citizens, anxiety negatively impacts citizens’ use, whereas institutional trust does not explain citizens’ use. Use intentions mediate the relations between respectively peer pressure and interpersonal trust in officials, and actual use. The study contributes to the literature on trust and anxiety (especially in the Chinese society) in relation to the use of microblogging by Chinese government, and adds to our understanding of the role of microblogging in state&#8209;citizen communication patterns in authoritarian governance regimes in general, and in the Chinese governance system in particular.

Abstract:
E&#8209;government initiatives struggle with realizing the transformational objectives defined in the most mature stages in the various e&#8209;government maturity models and ambitious e&#8209;government programs. Research indicates that, in general, e&#8209;government initiatives might have improved the efficiency of the public sector incrementally but failed to realize more transformational changes. This research summarizes t&#8209;government challenges and investigates how organizations can successfully overcome them and realize the goals of t&#8209;government in terms of citizen centricity and efficiency. The research is based in dynamic capability theory and on data from a Danish public library that has succeeded in transformational changes in line with the goals of efficiency and citizen centricity described in the t&#8209;government literature. The primary finding is that the success in this particular organization is based on a combination of environmental and organizational factors and on a long history of successful organizational changes. The context provides both pressure (e.g., competition) and support (e.g., funding) for transformation, and the organization has both the autonomy (e.g., to redesign processes) and the capabilities (e.g., regarding organizational change) needed for transformational change.

Organisational Challenges in the Implementation of ‘one&#8209;stop’ e&#8209;Government in Rwanda

Abstract:
One&#8209;stop e&#8209;government holds potential benefits in all contexts and especially in the context of developing countries and in the Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Implementation of one&#8209;stop e&#8209;government can be challenging as it normally requires addressing a number of organisational issues including those related to the integration of the individual government information systems of different departments which traditionally function as silos; tackling organisational issues can be difficult due to the nature of the public sector. However, the contemporary literature paints a picture of scarce research on the organisational issues that impede the implementation of one&#8209;stop e&#8209;government initiatives in LDCs. This paper explores the organisational issues underlying the implementation of ‘one&#8209;stop’ e&#8209;government initiatives in Rwanda, an LDC. The study explores the status of these elements as of and up to March 2017. The qualitative case study methodology used for this study involved data collection by means of documents and interviews with key managers from central government organisations, from a private company, and from local government service clerks. Template analysis was used as a method for data analysis. Even though the number of online services for citizens, businesses, and other agencies is growing rapidly and easy payment of service fees is available, a number of organisational issues were identified. These include the lack of a clear plan of ‘to&#8209;be’ service processes and a corresponding change management strategy. Service re&#8209;design was taking place very much ad hoc. There were also unclear systematic organisational learning mechanisms and unclear operational goals in the local government. Addressing these issues would contribute towards improving the implementation of one&#8209;stop e&#8209;government and its corresponding services in such a context. The paper contributes to research by providing insights into organisational issues in a country currently in an early stage of e&#8209;government development. For Rwandan e&#8209;government professionals, the paper suggests a way forward. It also helps decision makers in Rwanda and similar countries undertaking one&#8209;stop initiatives to understand the problem context of actions taken towards IT&#8209;driven institutional reform.

Abstract:
The multichannel management field (MCM) of e&#8209;government focuses on how government organizations select, prioritize and integrate public service channels in a multichannel environment as well as migrate citizens and other stakeholders from one channel to another to increase efficiency and user satisfaction. MCM scholars collaborate with practitioners, conduct field experiments and study government&#8209;to&#8209;citizen interaction in real&#8209;life settings. MCM studies have led to important empirical findings, theory building and field&#8209;tested practical recommendations. Despite such valuable contributions to both scholars and practitioners, there are no up&#8209;to&#8209;date, comprehensive literature reviews which synthesize the knowledge from the MCM literature.We therefore present a systematic and comprehensive literature review of MCM in e&#8209;government. Our review follows established guidelines and covers three main areas. (1) We identify lead scholars and outlets, concepts analyzed and the main methods and theoretical lenses applied. (2) We synthesize results and suggestions for future studies from the papers. (3) Finally, we identify knowledge gaps and propose research approaches to addressing these gaps.

Re&#8209;Imagining Digital Communications at a Large Federal Agency: A Case Study

Abstract:
A large US government agency undertook a multi&#8209;year systems change effort to re&#8209;imagine its digital communications activities, which are led by communications staff in its numerous sub&#8209;agencies and offices, along with a central coordinating office within this agency.  The systems change strategy used draws from the literature on systems change in the private and government sectors, from two previous systems change efforts within the agency, and from input provided by actively engaging and listening to staff at all levels of the agency. The systems change effort resulted in a business model for the coordinating office to use in advancing the agency’s digital activities.  It provides a framework for implementing activities more quickly &#8209; encouraging experimentation and emerging best practices. A significant result of the systems change effort to date is transformation of the agency’s main website.  At the beginning of this process, fewer than 20 percent of users were finding what they were looking for on the site.  Currently over 80 percent of users consistently say they found or partially found what they were looking for. Page load times also improved.  The coordinating digital communications office also has received a significant budget increase since these improvements took place. Despite limitations on generalizability from this case study, it may be useful for other government agencies when designing similar systems change activities

The Relationship between Website Accessibility and Usability: An Examination of U.S County Government Online Portals

Abstract:
Although providing accessible online services to people with disabilities is a legal requirement in the U.S for the federal government and highly recommended for other government agencies, severe accessibility issues persist on E&#8209;government portals. One potential cause of this problem is that the government lacks strong incentives to adopt a higher accessibility standard because people with disabilities constitute a small proportion of E&#8209;government users. By demonstrating that website accessibility is positively associated with usability, this study provides a potential solution to incentivize the government to adopt a higher accessibility standard. To test the relationship between accessibility and usability, 342 county government online portals were selected by a stratified sampling method. The conformance of the homepage of the websites to the WCAG 2.0 accessibility standard was evaluated using an automated tool. Then, an 18&#8209;item heuristic checklist was assembled based on prior works and used to assess the usability of the websites. After controlling for the potential confounding factors such as broadband availability and county budget, the correlation between the usability and accessibility scores was tested. The analysis shows a significant positive relationship exists between the usability and accessibility scores. This positive relationship suggests that improving the accessibility could also enhance the usability of websites. As a result, the online experience of non&#8209;disabled users could also be improved. The finding of the study implies that web accessibility could be approached and framed from a different perspective: it does not only benefits users with disabilities but also general users. This positive relationship could be leveraged to give the government more incentives to make E&#8209;government portals more accessible to people with disabilities.

Five Challenges for Benefits Management in Complex Digitalisation Efforts – and a Research Agenda to Address Current Shortcomings

Abstract:
Over the past decades a number of benefits realisation (BR) frameworks have been developed. The benefits management model (BMM) is considered to be the most widely adopted and is often seen as a reference for good practice in digitalisation efforts in single organisations. However, this literature provides little support for complex, inter&#8209;organisational efforts. This is problematic, considering that digitalisation increasingly involves multiple organisations. To explore this gap, we studied the phenomenon in a Norwegian inter&#8209;organisational eHealth effort. Based on a qualitative study involving 50 interviews, observations and document analyses, we identify five distinct challenges and suggest a research agenda with five propositions for benefits management in complex digitalisation settings that can be further explored and tested by other researchers. The challenges and propositions constitute novel insights into a poorly understood area and contain implications and directions that can benefit both researchers and practitioners working in similar contexts.

Enterprise Architecture Implementation Is a Bumpy Ride: A Case Study in the Norwegian Public Sector

Abstract:
Enterprise architecture (EA) is a widespread approach for the development of new digital solutions in a planned and controlled way for large and complex organisations. EA is also viewed as a prerequisite for the digitalisation of the public sector. However, public sector organisations struggle to implement EA programmes, and research has demonstrated that organisational and managerial issues are critical obstacles to EA implementation. This study aims to increase our understanding of EA implementation in the public sector by investigating the central challenges for EA initiatives and to trace the progress of current EA initiatives in the Norwegian public sector. An additional goal is to disclose some ways to improve the situation. We conducted three interpretive case studies in the hospital, higher education, and labour and welfare sectors. We have identified 28 challenges to the EA initiatives. We find that organisational and technical complexities, as well as a limited understanding of EA and lack of formal EA governance mechanisms, are significant obstacles. Among others, the lack of understanding of EA and its methodology will lead to problems with anchoring the EA approach in the organisation and facilitating the necessary EA arrangements to induce the promised benefits of EA, which are necessary requirements to establish the EA initiative’s legitimacy and foster the organisation’s willingness to implement change. Our study provides four lessons learned for planning and implementing EA initiatives, as follows: #1. It is advisable to take small steps. #2. The use of external consultants should be carefully considered. #3. Formal architectural governance mechanisms are important for legitimacy and enforced use. #4. Executive commitment and understanding of EA are crucial for achieving a sustainable EA initiative. Finally, we find a common evolution of the EA initiatives through the phases of optimism, resistance, decline and finally, reconsolidation of the most persistent ones.

Abstract:
Sustainable e&#8209;government has become an important consideration for governments. However, existing e&#8209;government literature on sustainability is sparse. A quantitative empirical study was conducted to survey the perceptions of Saudi Arabian citizens with regard to the characteristics of sustainable e&#8209;government. Survey data gathered from 442 respondents were analysed to investigate their understanding of the importance of each of these characteristics, allowing the identification of a set of key characteristics likely to influence citizens’ utilization of sustainable e&#8209;government services. The study also investigated users’ perceptions of three key barriers to the ability of policymakers to develop and adopt sustainable e&#8209;government systems. The results indicate that the characteristics perceived to be the most significant were usability, security, performance, transparency and flexibility, whereas respondents were relatively unconcerned with the social, environmental and economic dimensions of the impact of the software used in e&#8209;government systems. This study has also shed new light on experts’ perceptions by investigating sustainable e&#8209;government features from their perspective. Data gathered from 83 respondents affirms the importance of sustainable e&#8209;government, the importance of cooperation between software development department and government agencies during designing and using sustainable e&#8209;government, and the influence of sustainability qualities on e&#8209;government. These results will be utilised in future as part of a framework for evaluating sustainable e&#8209;government.

The Possibilities of Internet Voting in Jamaica: Moving from Convenience to Fixing the Problem of Voter Apathy among the Youth

Authors:
Lloyd G. Waller et al
Abstract:
Recent scholarship recognises the importance of information and communication technologies (ICT), particularly the Internet, and its focus on ways to overcome challenges to political participation. The advent of Internet voting or I&#8209;voting in encouraging youth political participation has been framed within the context of convenience voting which can help to strengthen democracy by encouraging voting, especially among apathetic youth. This paper explores the relationship between Internet voting and youth political participation in the Jamaican society through a survey of 600 youth. The findings suggest that while it may not substantially reduce apathy, which is more intricately linked to perceived overarching systemic failures, Internet voting holds the potential to improve voter turnout at the polls.  While convenience was not a major factor driving political apathy, it was an important factor in encouraging participation at the polls.

Abstract:
This paper examines the relation between municipalities’ social media performance and citizen satisfaction with the municipality. An observational study was conducted, based on four different Swedish national public data sources. The study shows that municipalities’ Facebook performance is correlated to citizens’ satisfaction with living in the municipality and with satisfaction with municipal service provision. There was however no significant relationship between Facebook performance and satisfaction with transparency and influence from a citizen perspective. In conclusion, one important implication of the study is that citizen perception regarding whether a municipality is a good place to live in or not is relat&#8209;ed to the use of social media for promoting the municipality. Furthermore, a relation between satisfaction and citizen perception of government service performance implies that social media could be valuable for interaction and co&#8209;creation. Finally, an implication is that usage of social media and the potential relationship to trust, influence and transparency must be further elaborated and studied. Overall, our recommendation is that municipalities and their citizens may benefit from well thought&#8209;out strategies of how to use social media for marketing, interaction and co&#8209;creating.

On Complex Adaptive Systems and Electronic Government: A Proposed Theoretical Approach for Electronic Government Studies

Abstract:
Electronic government (EG) is a multidisciplinary research field that has been developing rapidly since its initial conceptualization in the 1990s. It is currently experiencing high levels of growth in terms of scholars in the field, publications, research funding opportunities, and dedicated conferences. Though the field is growing in terms of research output, it does appear that the field is stagnated when it comes to theoretical development. This paper aims to address this stagnation by proposing a new approach for scholars within the field of EG to understand and study the complex issues that exist within the field. In this paper, it is argued that the field of electronic government is, in actuality, studying the co&#8209;evolutionary relationship between ICT and government within a changing environment. Thus, by adopting an approach based around complex adaptive systems (CAS) and complexity theory, new insight and potential research directions should become possible

Abstract:
The design of tools and interfaces for e&#8209;democracy systems takes place in a highly multidisciplinary context.However, the inter&#8209;contextual understanding of democracy is still immature. This article presents a framework suitable forevaluating tools for e&#8209;democracy. The framework has been developed based on earlier theories and frameworks and thenfurther evaluated against two test cases: Twitter and BottenAda. The evaluation model builds on the inclusion of differentviews of e&#8209;democracy, not seeing them as conflicting per se but rather making it possible for e&#8209;democracy tool users anddevelopers to understand the varying degree of support a tool can display for several aspects of democracy. The model alsoprovides a visualization of complex theories and can thus contribute to a more informed discussion on what types ofdemocratic values are being supported in a particular e&#8209;democracy tool.

Exploring Enterprise Information Systems Procurement in Public Service Organisations
Pages:
pp69&#8209;83
Authors:

Abstract:
Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) are often used by organisations to automate and integrate their business processes to create value and efficiency. However, the majority of EIS research is centred on the implementation phase with relatively little work on the pre&#8209;implementation phase. Another gap in the existing literature is that it usually ignores the wider institutional context when determining the generalisability of research findings. This study focuses on the procurement process and analyses three instances of EIS procurement in a public service organisation. The data collection is conducted using a socio&#8209;technical systems framework embedded within a case study methodology. Narrative analysis with a processual lens is used as an analytical tool in this study. In contrast to the existing conception of the procurement process as a completely rational and linear decision&#8209;making process, our findings explain it as a multi&#8209;level process where factors from the work&#8209;system and the macrosocial level play a crucial role in influencing the decisions at the organisational level. Technological imperative (work&#8209;system level) and business case (organisational level) are found to be critical factors in EIS procurement, in line with previous findings. However, the findings suggest a greater role of the macrosocial factors – EIS market, EIS vendor, and the institutional context. This study also notes the demonstrative nature of certain elements of the EIS procurement process in public service organisations. Thus, this study brings out the complexity and contextual nature of EIS procurement in public service organisations by demonstrating the interplay of factors operating at the work&#8209;system, organisational, and macrosocial levels.
