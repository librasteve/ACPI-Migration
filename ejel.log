Title:
Evaluating Virtual Learning Environments: what are we measuring?
Pages:
pp11&#8209;20
Authors:
Mary Dyson
Silvio Barreto Campello
Abstract:
A basic framework is proposed to distinguish between the many ways in which Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) can be evaluated. This includes the purpose of the evaluation, the type of methods that might be used and the measures employed. The framework is not intended to cover all applications but offers one means of structuring a review of past studies or may provide guidance on the type of study to conduct. A pilot study is introduced which compares an online course using different platforms which aims to measure engagement, participation and achievement of goals.

Title:
Cognitive Style and Attitudes Towards Using Online Learning and Assessment Methods
Pages:
pp21&#8209;28
Authors:
Martin Graff
Abstract:
The studies described in this paper sought to investigate several forms of online learning and assessment methods in terms their efficacy in facilitating student learning. The studies also sought to investigate how participants rated each method. Attitudes toward computer&#8209;assisted learning were not related to performance on each of the online methods employed, whereas some relationships were noted between cognitive styles and online learning and assessment. Finally, evaluation feedback from participants indicated that each online task was rated positively. Implications of the findings for further implementation of online instructional methods are discussed.

Biomedical Online Learning: The route to success
Pages:

Authors:
Patricia Harvey
Abstract:
The potential of the World Wide Web for rapid global communication is driving the creation of specifically tailored courses for employees, yet few practitioners have the necessary experience in on&#8209;line teaching methods, or in preparing documents for the web. Experience gained in developing six online training modules for the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry sectors is informing the development by a partnership of academics and practitioners of seven online modules that will meet requirements for continuing professional development in the health sector. This paper highlights lessons for success.

Interactive Technology Impact on Quality Distance Education
Pages:
pp35&#8209;44
Authors:
Samer Hijazi
Abstract:
This paper reports on a study to determine if existing technology is adequate for the delivery of quality distance education. The survey sample was 392 respondents from a non&#8209;traditional graduate level. The study included 15 descriptive questions on course assessment and satisfaction. The three hypotheses used Chi&#8209;square to find relationships between interactivity and three other variables: progress, communication mode, and the desire to take another course. Responses showed that taking a distance education course was worthwhile. Findings, recommendations and conclusion are included.

Title:
Integrating Distributed Learning with just&#8209;in&#8209;context Knowledge Management
Pages:
pp45&#8209;50
Authors:
Roy. Williams
Abstract:
This paper addresses some key design issues in e&#8209;learning, and its integration with knowledge management. The underlying premise is that the purpose of e&#8209;learning is useful knowledge, and that the design of e&#8209;learning should therefore be integrated with the design of related knowledge management — particularly personal knowledge management. e&#8209;learning will be explored using the notion of "distributed learning". Knowledge management will be explored using the notion of "just&#8209;in&#8209;context knowledge", emphasising both the contextual underpinning of knowledge, and its strategic value — that is to say its applied value, and its embeddedness in decision making processes. The potential for distributed learning to optimise shared resources is also explored.

Sage on the Stage in the Digital Age: The Role of Online Lecture in Distance Learning
Pages:
pp1&#8209;14
Authors:
Q B. Chung
Abstract:
The Internet can be a useful tool that can enhance interactivity in classes. Accordingly, offering distance learning courses using the Web, especially in the asynchronous mode for the additional flexibility of time, is becoming an established practice in higher education. Web&#8209;based distance learning comes with numerous benefits, but not without worries for potentials deficiencies. One such deficiency in the current distance learning framework is the lack of lecture, the most relied&#8209;upon and proven means of instruction in the traditional classroom settings. This paper raises an issue of the lack of lectures in Web&#8209;based distance learning, and proposes that streaming video take the role of online lecture in that setting. Described in this paper are the rationale to put the lecture back into e&#8209;learning in higher education, two case studies in which the steps were taken to implement the proposed method, and the feedback from the students who took such courses in the undergraduate business curriculum and the MBA program.

Project Learning and Virtual Collaboration &#8209; A Master Program in ICT and Learning
Pages:
pp15&#8209;22
Authors:
Bo Fibiger et al
Abstract:
This paper will introduce a master program in ICT and Learning (MIL) and present some of the experiences we have gained so far. MIL is a result of a collaborative initiative taken by five Danish universities, and it is an accredited part&#8209;time 2&#8209;year master program. It is unique in the sense that it builds on the pedagogical framework of project pedagogy and is based on online collaboration.The paper will describe MIL, the universities involved, the administrative organization, and the profile of the students. We will discuss the pedagogical framework and the project collaboration in relation to the modularity and flexibility that characterize the study and allow admission of part&#8209;time students, full&#8209;time students and students who only sign up for one accredited module. The methodology will be illustrated through empirical snapshots from selected modules in the start&#8209;up phase, and the focus will be directed towards problems experienced by the students. From an analytical perspective, the paper will identify and discuss fundamental problems related to the organization, flexibility, and implementation of project pedagogy online.MIL is organized around ICT and Learning and the study theme focuses on ICT and Learning. In addition, MIL provides a learning space where practice is under constant negotiation and reconstruction as an inherent, integrated part of the learning process. Consequently, we argue that MIL may be seen as an example of best practice in blended learning.

Abstract:
The number of virtual learning environments (VLEs) is increasing. Already a few case studies claim that VLEs are more effective as a learning method than traditional lecturing. Many of these case studies are in the area of information and communication technology (ICT). Therefore, the good learning results are not surprising. The aim of this paper is to examine the suitability of a VLE for higher education by comparing learning with a VLE and learning in a traditional lecture on an occupational safety engineering course. We will compare the learning results and the students opinions of their learning process The results show that the VLE students outperformed the lecture students. On the basis of these results and previous case studies, the VLE is suitable for higher education. Nevertheless VLEs should be used with caution in higher education. They should add extra value to a course. One possible value would be to use the VLE self&#8209;study method to evaluate ones learning before a final exam.

Using Data Mining for e&#8209;Learning Decision Making

Authors:
David Monk
Abstract:
The initial investigation aimed to examine the paths learners followed when offered the course in a custom virtual learning environment (VLE) which is structured by tasks, course materials and learning resources. However, it quickly became clear that students were spending little time with the course materials online and the time spent with each page was usually less than 20 seconds. Consequently a better understanding of how learners accessed the electronic course materials was needed to evaluate the effectiveness of developing and delivering courses in this way.By combining data on the activity with content with user profiles it was possible to examine alternate information perspectives and reveal patterns in large volume data sets. Mining data in this way provides ways to learn about learners in order to make effective decisions regarding teaching methods, delivery models and infrastructure investment.

Customer&#8209;Driven Development for Rapid Production of Assessment Learning Objects
Pages:
pp1&#8209;6
Authors:
Andrew Adams
Shirley Williams
Abstract:
Customer&#8209;Driven Development is a technique from the software development method called extreme Programming (XP) where customers (most importantly including end users of all levels) are closely involved in the software design and redesign process. This method of producing software suitable for customers has been adapted to help in the production of e&#8209;learning material, in particular, Assessment Learning Objects (ALOs) consisting of multiple&#8209; choice questions. Asking undergraduate students to produce multiple&#8209;choice questions as part of their formal assessment processes facilitated this.  The outcome shows two distinct benefits to this process. Firstly, the students who took part in this project benefited from the encouragement to participate in reflective learning, both on the specific topic on which they chose to produce a multiple choice question, and in the methods and purposes of multiple choice questions (which form a significant part of their self&#8209;assessment regime and summative assessment exam). Secondly, of the questions produced by students a significant number of them were of suitable quality to be used for future cohorts and to be made available to the wider community. This gives two important benefits to staff: developing a wide range of questions is difficult and time consuming; student insight into misunderstandings of material can often be greater than that of staff. Resources for the development of ALOs are scarce and given that students benefit directly from being asked to develop their own questions, the year&#8209;on&#8209;year expansion of a question set produced by students can be a very useful resource.

Abstract:
MyGfL which stands for Malaysian Grid for Learning is a One&#8209;Stop&#8209;Center for quality assured online learning content, tools and services with the aim to promote and support the lifelong learning agenda in Malaysia. It is a platform that enables anyone to learn, unlearn and relearn from anywhere at anytime through any web browser so as to accelerate the growth of K&#8209;Society. The main objectives of MyGfL are to enhance discoverability of e&#8209;learning content from heterogeneous sources through the use of metadata, to develop e&#8209;learning standards to ensure conformance and adoption of best practices in e&#8209;learning content and systems, to provide e&#8209;Learning systems and tools to enable and support e&#8209;Learning activities and processes for the purpose of lifelong learning, and also to encourage the sharing and development of localindigenous content. Pilot programs have been conducted at different levels of the Malaysian society where processes and factors involved in implementing e&#8209;learning to the community and observations of societal acceptance of e&#8209;learning were noted. Utilization of MyGfL by the pilot groups has furnished vital information regarding acceptanceperception of use, current standards of computer literacy and skills. This case study will depict the impact of MyGfL with regards to its objectives and public perception towards MyGfL as a platform for lifelong learning.

Abstract:
This paper describes a mechanism developed by the authors to gather student feedback from formative revision Multiple Choice Questionnaires (MCQs) within an on&#8209;line learning system. The MCQs provided first year Computer Science students with instant formative feedback, while data was also gathered about student responses, such as the percentage opting for each answer and the time taken to answer the question. We measured how students were using our on&#8209;line learning system; whether they were in fact 'workers' who provided answers to the MCQs, were 'lurkers' who did not provide answers but asked for solutions or 'shirkers', who did not access the site at all!   The data indicates that the time taken to answer a harder question was less than that of an easier question suggesting that the workers turned into lurkers strategically when they thought they could not answer successfully. It was not however clear whether the lurker suddenly finding an easier question would change back into a worker. Future work to encourage the shirkers to participate is also discussed.

Delivering What Students say They Want On&#8209;Line: Towards Academic Participation in the Enfranchisement of e&#8209;Learners?
Pages:
pp27&#8209;34
Authors:
Richard Hall
Abstract:
Sustainable e&#8209;Learning holds the promise of enabling higher education to meet the needs of a large and diverse market. Central to this is the response of academic staff teams in meeting the needs of individual learners, in order to enfranchise them within an evolving, enabling learning context. Enfranchisement is underpinned by the management of learner&#8209;expectations in the value&#8209;added nature of the on&#8209;line learning experience. However, learner&#8209; enfranchisement demands that on&#8209;line interaction is both accepted by academic teams and educationally liberating. Liberation requires meaningful existence, and hence active participation, within a 'supercomplex' world, in which both individual identities and the ability to manage information are tested.  This paper assesses ways in which learner&#8209;enfranchisement can be encouraged by academic teams. It pivots around the outcomes from student evaluations of a strategic e&#8209;Learning implementation in one UK higher education institution. The conclusions that it draws focus upon strategies for adding pedagogic value, increasing academic participation and developing e&#8209;Learning sustainability in order to enfranchise e&#8209;learners. The argument highlights ways in which academic teams can move from a battery&#8209;intensive approach to e&#8209;Learning towards one that is more free&#8209;ranging. It highlights how academic staff can increase the sustainable, inclusive value of the learning experience at a minimised cost. From this basis, it is argued that any extant disenfranchisement in the delivery of e&#8209;Learning can begin to be addressed by increased team&#8209;work. A by&#8209;product for those teams is that in the very process of engaging their students, there is more hope that they will in&#8209;turn become empowered within their own use of e&#8209;Learning.

Collaborative On&#8209;Line Teaching: The Inevitable Path to Deep Learning and Knowledge Sharing?

pp43&#8209;50
Authors:
Karin Tweddell Levinsen
Abstract:
It is often stressed that the pedagogic models and approaches of Collaborative Online Learning support a learner's shared knowledge building within collaborating groups of learners, the individual construction of knowledge and the formation of an ongoing learning Community of Practice. Based on a recent case study of a Danish Master's programme, this paper will demonstrate that the emerging collaborative practice displays tendencies contrary to the generally accepted assumptions. The outcome is not only based on the models and their attributes, it is also affected by the emerging practice itself and the interaction among the participants during a course. From this perspective, it is relevant to look at which possibilities and obstacles teachers encounter when they try to detect slowly emerging tendencies that may lead to major misinterpretations of the subject matter and marginalize or even exclude students from participating in the learning Community of Practice. In conclusion, the case study will identify the slowly emerging tendencies that may be detected and observed at an early stage and thus indicate areas in on&#8209;line learning environments that require special attention.

This paper presents a study in a UK university that investigated how first&#8209;year (freshman) Information Systems undergraduates perceive learning through courseware containing real&#8209;world erroneous examples derived from their peers and what obstacles had to be overcome to implement effective e&#8209;Learning support for using and creating such courseware. The study finds that students find the courseware very effective in dealing with their personal misconceptions while also providing other secondary pedagogic benefits for both students and lecturers.

Topic Maps e&#8209;Learning Portal Development

Authors:
Kamila Olsevicova
Abstract:
Topic Maps, ISOIEC 13250 standard, are designed to facilitate the organization and navigation of large collections of information objects by creating meta&#8209;level perspectives of their underlying concepts and relationships. The underlying structure of concepts and relations is expressed by domain ontologies. The Topics Maps technology can become the core of an e&#8209;learning portal that will integrate different kinds of information and knowledge resources, available in the educational institution — this idea was explored in the Ph.D. dissertation of the author. The offered portal solution promises to bring advantages both for content consumers (students) and content providers (teachers, administrative staff), but numerous problems hinder the practical implementation of this portal and therefore it requires certain changes in the functioning of the educational institution and asks teachers, teaching assistants and e&#8209;courses designers to change their routines and to develop new skills. In the paper we offer a new methodology for development and maintenance of the Topic Maps e&#8209;learning portal and we briefly present a pilot application.

Encouraging Student Participation in an On&#8209;line Course Using 'Pull' Initiatives Paul

pp68&#8209;79
Authors:
Peachey Paul
Abstract:
This paper presents an empirical study involving initiatives that encouraged students to log onto online courses in entrepreneurship delivered by the University of Glamorgan. The aim of the research was to explore items of interest to the online students that may increase participation in the forums and hence potentially enhanced engagement with the course module. The online tutor created additional forums within the discussion board of the virtual learning environment (VLE) that included a variety of online games and quizzes that were relative to the module topic. The rationale that underpinned this initiative was to reduce the possible blandness of the VLE as perceived by some students. The games and quizzes were carefully designed to enhance knowledge in the subject and thereby provided additional learning opportunities. The initiative was also thought to assist in the formation of an online learning community. The study involved experimentation by the online tutor with subsequent observation of the behavioural patterns of the students. In one module, the dedicated social and games forums attracted 54% of the total postings for the module. The findings suggest that including online quizzes and games that are relevant to the taught subject can increase the participation levels of the students and possibly enhance the learning process. The findings of this study may inform the design, development and delivery of online learning programmes. The findings also inform strategies of good practice in online moderation and may help to reduce withdrawal rates, which are typically high in the field of e&#8209; learning (Potashnik and Capper, 1998).

Using Software Testing Techniques for Efficient Handling of Programming Exercises in an e&#8209;Learning Platform

Peter Westerkamp
Abstract:
e&#8209;Learning has become a major field of interest in recent years, and multiple approaches and solutions have been developed. A typical form of e&#8209;learning application comprises exercise submission and assessment systems that allow students to work on assignments whenever and where they want (i.e., dislocated, asynchronous work). In basic computer science courses, programming exercises are widely used and courses usually have a very large number of participants. However, there is still no efficient way for supporting tutors to correct these exercises, as experience has shown that correction (and, beyond that, automatic grading) are difficult and time consuming.  In this paper we present an enhancement of the xLx platform developed at the University of Muenster to efficiently support tutors in handling Java programming exercises electronically. The new component is based on concepts of automatic static and dynamic testing approaches, well known from software engineering, and provides an automatic pre&#8209; correction of submitted solutions. In addition, a tutor is able to annotate solutions manually, by adding comments that are associated with the source code of the solution in an intelligent way. Static tests are based on a compilation of the sources to find syntactical errors, while dynamic tests use test cases defined by tutors during the creation of the exercises and have to be executed correctly on the solutions in order to receive credits for the exercises.

ICT and Schools: Identification of Factors Influencing the use of new Media in Vocational Training Schools
Pages:
pp96&#8209;103
Authors:
Alexandra Totter
Daniela Stütz
Gudela Grote
Abstract:
In this paper, we analysed teachers' characteristics described in the literature on classroom media use to identify those factors, which can explain teachers' use of new media in classrooms with some degree of validity. Using this literature as a basis, in this paper we develop a theoretical model which describes both positive and negative factors, which influence teachers' use of new media in classrooms. These factors include: "constructivist teaching style", "willingness to cooperate", "openness to change", "lack of ICT&#8209;competence", "lack of time" and "lack of ICT confidence". We assessed the validity of the model by testing it using data collected from a survey of fifty&#8209;two Swiss and Austrian teachers, We carried out Pearson correlations to evaluate whether the factors in the model had a positive or a negative influence on teachers' classroom media use. The hypothesized correlations between our variables were all statistically significant. Specifically, all six variables were significantly correlated with the dependent variable "use of new media in classrooms". This result supported our hypothesis concerning positive and negative relationships between variables. In a second, exploratory investigation, we performed OLS regression analysis to investigate, which of the factors in our model are of predictive value with respect to the dependent variable "use of new media in classrooms". Our findings show that the variable "constructivist teaching style" was of particular explanatory value. This suggests that only teachers who adopt a pupil&#8209;oriented, constructivist teaching style are likely to make use of new technology in classrooms. The variable "lack of available time" was identified as a second important factor influencing the "use of new media in classrooms". This suggests that teachers are not able to make full use of new media when they lack the time needed to prepare teaching material using the new media, since time is also needed for teachers to learn new hardware and software computer skills. The results of this study have a series of important, practical implications.

Abstract:
The study of database systems is typically core in undergraduate and postgraduate programmes related to computer science and information systems. However, one component of this curriculum that many learners have diffi&#8209; culty with is database analysis and design, an area that is critical to the development of modern information systems. This paper proposes a set of principles for the design of a games&#8209;based learning environment to help the learner develop the skills necessary to understand and perform database analysis and design effectively. The paper also presents some preliminary results on the use of this environment.

Abstract:
The challenge of the semantic web is the provision of distributed information with well&#8209;defined meaning, understandable for different parties. e&#8209;Learning is efficient task relevant and just&#8209;in&#8209;time learning grown from the learning requirements of the new dynamically changing, distributed business world. In this paper we design an e&#8209;Learning system by using a semantic web and show how the semantic web resource description formats can be utilised for automatic generation of hypertext structures from distributed metadata. It is primarily based on ontology&#8209;based descriptions of content, context and structure of the learning materials and thus provides flexible and personalised access to these learning materials.

Establishing Effective e&#8209;Learning Communities within the Teaching Profession: Comparing Two Projects to Discover the Necessary Ingredients.

pp119&#8209;126
Authors:
Ros Evansand Eileen Bellett
Abstract:
This article sets out to compare and contrast two different projects, aimed to get primary teachers collaborating online, with respect to advice from research on how to engage participants. The first project tried to encourage teachers in small rural schools to share ideas for the implementation of the National Numeracy Strategy. The second was intended to provide a platform for teachers to develop materials for the teaching of religious education in the classroom. There appears to be four 'necessary ingredients' for the successful establishment of e&#8209;learning communities within practising teachers. These include: face&#8209;to&#8209;face meetings; high quality IT support; outcomes, which are of real benefit to participants; adequate funding. The outcome of the comparison is felt to add to the knowledge of how to encourage participation in online forums within a context outside those normally researched. As such it should help those trying to design similar projects in the future.

Abstract:
This study sought to investigate four separate issues regarding student performance in a blended learning environment in the delivery of a Psychology course to 140 University undergraduates. Firstly, to investigate the relationship between student performance on three different coursework assignments and their performance on interim online assessments. Secondly, to investigate the relationship between student performance on coursework assignments and their perceptions of online community. Thirdly, to investigate the relationship between students' online community scores and their engagement with an online assessment. Finally, to look at the relationship between students' cognitive information processing style and coursework performance. The findings revealed that student coursework performance was positively related to their engagement with the online assessments. Furthermore, student online community scores were related to their coursework performance as was cognitive style. The results are discussed in terms of a consideration of these three factors in course design within a blended learning framework.

Abstract:
Doctoral research considered whether healthcare students were able to develop characteristics of Communities of Practice when engaged in an interprofessional online module. Using a case study approach the research included two phases. Within phase one a questionnaire was administered to the group of 109 healthcare students. These were analysed to gain information on which to base sampling for the subsequent phase. Phase two employed three strands of data collection; five students completed an online diary, the online interaction of seven students was captured on a discussion board and three students were interviewed. Data were analysed using a form of pattern matching. The results suggested students were able to develop the essential elements of Communities of Practice. This was not uniformly seen however, and particular issues emerged for the online community.  This paper focuses on discussing the contribution of the research to the development of the Communities of Practice framework for online learning. The discussion will review the main findings of the research, showing how these have led to the development of the theory. It offers an augmented framework, in which the elements of mutual engagement, joint enterprise and shared repertoire are enhanced to include those facets necessary to support an online learning community. Finally, it is suggested that the augmented framework may have applicability to other professional groups engaging in online learning and working, with consideration given to how it might support e&#8209;based communities.

Abstract:
Ideally, learning resources should be built over a shared pool of fine reusable granular learning objects. However, in order to avoid contextual lacks, dynamic creation of such resources would mostly rely on the conceptual relationships among learning objects inside a repository. These conceptual relationships, as well as the learning objects creation, are best established if students' learning styles are considered. Common standards like Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) do not have tools to provide conceptual relationships among fine granular learning objects. This paper presents a conceptual lattice&#8209;based architecture for using SCORM to provide an effective mapping of conceptual relationships among learning objects.

Managed Learning Environments and an Attendance Crisis?

Abstract:
Students who have the benefit of a Managed Learning Environment (MLE) are very appreciative of the facility to access lecture notes, practical and tutorial exercises and other learning resources. This access allows students to work independently and in many students' eyes, obviates the need to attend all timetabled sessions. Should the lecturers be worried about this? Blended learning, with its mixture of online and face&#8209;to&#8209;face activities, allows for students' different learning styles and for balancing external commitments. We report from a University in which the MLE, StudyNet, is extensively used on the majority of degree programmes and is regularly praised by the students. In this digital age the expectation of students is that all resources should be available electronically. However, a short survey identified a general unease among academics that these facilities adversely affect attendance and consequently student performance. Our broader study, at a mid&#8209;point in an academic year, investigated relationships between attendance, performance in assessed coursework and students' preferred ways of working. We found that students rated the contact time very strongly but placed most emphasis on carrying out work for themselves. There was a mismatch between many students' perceptions of their use of the contact hours and the evidence from attendance records. Overall, our study sheds some light on the complex relationships between blended learning, student behaviour, attendance, and attainment.

Benefits of e&#8209;Learning Benchmarks: Australian Case Studies
Pages:
pp11&#8209;20
Authors:
Sarojni Choy
Abstract:
In 2004 the Australian Flexible Learning Framework developed a suite of quantitative and qualitative indicators on the uptake, use and impact of e&#8209;learning in the Vocational Education and Training (VET) sector. These indicators were used to design items for a survey to gather quantitative data for benchmarking. A series of four surveys gathered data from VET providers, teachers, students and their employers. The data formed baseline indicators that were used to establish organisational goals and benchmarks for e&#8209;learning. These indicators were the first known set for benchmarking e&#8209;learning in Australia.   The case studies in this paper illustrate ways in which VET providers have approached e&#8209;learning benchmarking, the benefits achieved and the lessons that they learned. The cases exemplify how VET providers have adapted the baseline indicators, how the indicators informed organisational plans and e&#8209;learning outcomes. The benefits of benchmarking are categorised under three purposes: reporting, performance management, and service improvement. A set of practical strategies is derived from the cases for consideration by other organisations interested in benchmarking e&#8209;learning services.

Determining Areas of Weakness in Introductory Programming as a Foundation for Reusable Learning Objects
Pages:

Authors:

Abstract:
Teaching programming to novices has proved challenging for both learner and lecturer due to the abstraction and complexity of the subject matter. The work described in this paper is part of an EU funded Minerva project called TUPULO (Teaching Undergraduate Programming Using Learning Objects) which aims to address the challenges faced by novice programmers by providing them with an innovative learning tool. This learning tool that is currently under development and rollout incorporates a set of Reusable Learning Objects (RLOs) based on sound pedagogical principles and encapsulated in a Constructivist Learning Environment (CLE), which includes a meta&#8209;cognitive interface. The subject matter experts and instructional designers in the local academic partner institutions designed these learning objects. The outputs and findings of the TUPULO project will not only benefit learners in the partner institutions involved, but by being disseminated to the wider educational community, they will also help learners in the domain on a broader scale. This paper describes the preparatory work undertaken in order to establish a set of potential LOs for development based on the student's main areas of weakness.   When attempting to build learning objects for use in any domain the primary consideration should always be the needs and abilities of the learners. This paper describes the work done by the authors in conducting a user needs analysis in order to establish the key problem areas facing learners of introductory programming. A methodology for user needs capture and analysis was produced based on the set of user groups available at the Institutions and the needs of the users were captured and analysed. The methodology was devised to incorporate both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the information available to us regarding students. Exam scripts and corresponding results together with focus group discussions were used in order to ascertain perceptions regarding the course content, delivery, level of difficulty and areas of difficulty in programming. Additional institutional information such as students' leaving certificate points and Maths grade together with students' overall performance in other subject areas were used to investigate possible correlations. The analysis of this data provided some preliminary information on the ways in which students interpret various questions and their conceptual difficulties in understanding certain topics. This analysis leads to the final selection of programming topics for potential development as reusable learning objects.

Authors:

Abstract:
In this paper we report on research related to the provision of automated feedback based on a computer adaptive test (CAT), used in formative assessment. A cohort of 76 second year university undergraduates took part in a formative assessment with a CAT and were provided with automated feedback on their performance. A sample of students responded in a short questionnaire to assess their attitude to the quality of the feedback provided. In this paper, we describe the CAT and the system of automated feedback used in our research, and we also present the findings of the attitude survey. On average students reported that they had a good attitude to our automated feedback system. Statistical analysis was used to show that attitude to feedback was not related to performance on the assessment (p>0.05). We discuss this finding in the light of the requirement to provide fast, efficient and useful feedback at the appropriate level for students.

Abstract:
It is widely accepted that employees in small business suffer from a lack of knowledge and skills. This lack of skills means that small companies will miss out on new business opportunities. This is even more evident with respect to the adoption of Internet marketing in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). This paper reports a pilot research project TRIMAR, which aims to develop a web&#8209;based intelligent training system to aid small business employees in their learning and decision&#8209;making regarding the use of the Internet as a new marketing medium. TRIMAR attempts to contribute to the wider debate on the content and style of training most suitable to small businesses. It aims to identify the training needs of small businesses for Internet marketing at a pan&#8209;European level and to seek the most effective ways to address training and support needs with web&#8209;based systems. Based on training needs analysis carried out within five European countries: UK, Germany, Poland, Slovak Republic and Portugal, a web based system for gaining Internet marketing knowledge and skills was constructed. The system consists of three major subsystems: Self Assessment Tool (SAT), Training Modules (TM), and a Case Retrieval System (CRS). Various users through an online questionnaire tested the system. The initial feedback revealed that the case base training approach delivered on the Internet provided a highly appropriate training medium for SMEs.

Abstract:
As part of a national e&#8209;learning benchmarking initiative of the UK Higher Education Academy, the University of Manchester is carrying out a pilot study of a method to benchmark e&#8209;learning in an institution. The pilot was designed to evaluate the operational viability of a method based on the e&#8209;Learning Maturity Model developed at the University of Wellington, New Zealand, which, in turn was derived from Carnegie Mellon's widely accepted Capability Maturity Model. The method is based on gathering evidence about the many and interdependent processes in the e&#8209;learning and student lifecycles and takes a holistic view of maturity, addressing multiple aspects. This paper deals with the rationale for the selected method and explains the adoption of a process based approach. It describes the iterative refinement of the questionnaire used to elicit evidence for measures of five aspects of maturity in a range of e&#8209;learning processes, in five process areas. The pilot study will produce a map of evidence of e&#8209;learning practice across the processes matrix and a measure of the degree of embedding in a sample of faculties within the institution expressed as capability and maturity. To provide a useful measure of where an organisation is with respect to a particular aspect of e&#8209;learning, it needs to be able to act on that measure, finding any new activities required or modifying current activities to improve its processes. The pilot study aims to evaluate the potential for improvement inherent in the capability maturity model and to examine the resource implications of obtaining useful evidence. A successful benchmarking effort should be able to inform an institution's planning and resourcing processes and the outcomes of this pilot should lead to an informed decision about a method for benchmarking the embedding of e&#8209;learning, both for the particular institution and for the sector, which in turn can lead to operational suggestions for improvement.

Abstract:
E&#8209;learning materials often have a linear design where all learners are forced into a single&#8209;mode pedagogy, which is contrary to the interaction that occurs in face&#8209;to&#8209;face learning. Ideally, e&#8209;learning materials should be nonlinear, interactive, contain context&#8209;sensitive and active learning elements, and accommodate various learning levels and styles. This paper presents an educator's perspective on approaches to designing such e&#8209;learning materials, which are essential to enhancing the education of future generations of students.

Abstract:
Given the high rate of student drop&#8209;out and withdrawal from courses and programs using an online learning format, it is important to consider innovative ways to foster and encourage student success in online environments. One such way is to incorporate aspects of student future orientation into the design of online instruction. This paper presents an overview of a program of research examining whether perceptions of student motivation, self&#8209;regulation, and future time perspective can be positively influenced through future oriented instruction in a blended learning (semi&#8209;virtual) environment at a German university. Individual differences in student future time orientation can provide insight into this interesting connection between the influence of attitude toward time on motivational and self&#8209;regulatory processes in learning. In conclusion, the practical implications of this topic for the design of online learning environments must be considered: Increased effort needs to be taken for developing methods for online instruction to tap into and encourage the future orientation of students, and for providing meaningful connections to the content and possible future outcomes. This paper intends to provide insight into and examples of how an online course or semi&#8209;virtual programs can benefit from a future oriented design.

Abstract:
This paper analyses and discusses the future challenges that tertiary educational institutions may expect to face when the traditional organisational forms and norms of the industrial society meet the first generation of natural born ICT using students who have lived their whole life with ICT and the ever changing norms and demands of the unfolding information society. In order to analyse the premise for these challenges the paper applies a long&#8209;term perspective on the generations and organisations affected by the transmission. A key to gain insight to the future students and the nature of the encounter is research aimed at the present primary school. Additionally a key to the organisational perspective is identification of organisations' readiness for change and the potential barriers for adaptation to the information society and the ´ power users´. Based on the analysis, the paper comprises an outline of institutional obstacles inhibiting a successful encounter and argues the necessity of integrating top&#8209;down and bottom&#8209;up initiatives in future organisations. Thus, the process of change demands awareness and support from both the authorities empowered to make grants and from the management of the educational organisations, and the paper explicitly focuses on collaborating teaching staffs as a tool for improving both individual and organisational adaptability.

Abstract:
Evaluation is an unavoidable feature in any teaching or learning scenario. The evaluation strategy of students differs widely throughout the world. Further, most of the institutes do not use any objective technique to assess the teaching performance of a teacher. The present paper defines performance metrics both for student and teacher evaluation and also discusses the methodology for calculating relevant metrics. In a decision&#8209;making scenario, these metrics may help in providing enough insight into the assimilation capability of students and teaching capability of teachers. Once measured properly for an adequate length of time, these metrics can also be customised to provide other useful information like utility of a course modification, institutional performance etc. The system has been tested for analysing four courses in a premier engineering institute and the outcome found to be encouraging.

Abstract:
This paper describes the initial findings of a longitudinal case study that investigates the use of a virtual learning environment to enhance the placement experience for full time postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE) students. Geographically separated trainees can feel very isolated on placement. The purpose of the VLE was to try to alleviate this by offering a way for trainees to maintain contact and offer mutual support while on placement. A preliminary analysis of the results is used to offer some insight into how this type of support might be improved for future students, by the construction of minimum pedagogical framework for initial teacher training.

Abstract:
Acknowledging the fact that teachers are at the heart of any educational reform effort, the European Union funded project EarlyStatistics aims to enrich European children's learning of statistics by offering their mathematics teachers a high&#8209;quality online professional development program. A central conviction underlying the design of the program is that learning as part of a community of practitioners can provide a useful model for teacher professional development. Teachers participating in the program will form a virtual community of practice, which will support best practices and innovation in statistics education by providing access to a wide array of colleagues, discussions, and resources eluding teachers in their workplaces.

Abstract:
Based on facial expression (FE), this paper explores the possible use of the affective communication in virtual environments (VEs). The attention of affective communication is examined and some research ideas for developing affective communication in virtual environments are proposed. We place an emphasis on communication between virtual entities, which make use of other data apart from the information being communicated. In particular, we explore the capacity of VEs to communicate affective states, i.e. those aspects of communication concerned with emotional response, and discover how agents within VEs can model and use affective states to enhance the realism of the VEs. Moreover, we discuss the social intelligence that renders affective behaviours of software agents and its application to a collaborative learning system. We argue that socially appropriate affective behaviours would provide a new dimension for collaborative e&#8209;learning systems.

Abstract:
E&#8209;learning has acquired a prime place in many discussions recently. A number of research efforts around the world are trying to enhance education and training through improving e&#8209;learning facilities. This paper briefly explains one such attempt aimed at designing a system to support video clips in e&#8209;learning and explains how profiles of the presenters in video clips can be used to improve the usefulness of e&#8209;learning systems. The system proposed is capable of storing educational video clips with their semantics and retrieving required video clip segments efficiently on their semantics. The system creates profiles of presenters appearing in the video clips based on their facial features and uses these profiles to partition similar video clips into logical meaningful segments. The paper also discusses one of the main problems identified in profile construction and presents a novel algorithm to solve this problem.

Abstract:
Contrary to conventional expectations, the reality of computing education in Taiwan's vocational  schools is not so practically oriented, and thus reveals much room for improvement. In this context, we conducted a quasi&#8209;experiment to examine the effects of applying web&#8209;based problem&#8209;based learning (PBL), web&#8209;based self&#8209; regulated learning (SRL), and their combination to enhance students' computing skills in a short&#8209;term module of deploying Microsoft Word. Two classes of 106 first&#8209;year students were divided into 2 (PBL vs. non&#8209;PBL) Ã— 2 (SRL vs. non&#8209;SRL) experimental groups. Results were generally positive. This study thus provided a significant illustration of a promising design and implementation of chosen web&#8209;based pedagogies for a short&#8209;term module. With limitations in mind, we hope that the lesson learned is also useful for those teachers engaged in e&#8209;learning, specifically, in vocational schools.

Abstract:
This paper examines the contribution of focus groups in evaluating learner satisfaction with a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). It explores the views of a group of introductory level Post Compulsory Education learners that have a history of disaffection, impoverished learning and challenged written and communication skills. The outcome of this study will be used to inform future VLE material design for inclusion in a School policy document. Additionally, the findings will contribute to the development of both a broader range of discrete ICT programs delivered by a VLE and embedded ICT within a range of vocational qualifications across the Post Compulsory Education Vocational Curriculum.

Abstract:
This study examines whether two online courses offering educational support for junior faculty have a positive effect on their attitudes and curriculum and teaching capacities (CTC) learning. The data used in the analysis are from two 2005 online University training courses. The tasks the online courses assign to faculty, the resources they provide, the learning environment they create, and the conversations they provoke proved to be consequential in shaping faculty's attitudes. The results also indicate that junior faculty who participate in individual and collective online developing activities, such as constructing teaching episodes and communicating with other colleagues, are more likely to gain a better understanding of how to teach their scientific disciplines.

Abstract:
In this paper, we consider an approach to developing critically thoughtful e&#8209;Learning communities of practicewhere participants are deliberate about the use of specific intellectual tools supporting critical thinking. We address Garrison & Anderson's (2003) argument that such critical thinking should play a central role within the ecology of e&#8209; Learning communities and provide our view of what such communities might look like. To do this, we offer four categories of strategies helping to develop such communitiescollaborative agreement on goals; facilitator(s) modelling and teaching the tools supporting critical thinking; and shaping communicative interactions within the e&#8209;Learning environment to encourage thinking. We provide examples from a current study involving 36 kindergarten to grade 12 teachers' blended use of information and communication technologies (ICT) and face&#8209;to&#8209;face sessions to illustrate our view.

Abstract:
As a matter of fact e&#8209;Learning still has not really caught on for corporate training purposes. Investigations on the reasons reveal that e&#8209;Learning modules like WBTs often miss any relevance for the tasks to be accomplished in the day&#8209;to&#8209;day workplace settings. The very learning needs both from an organizational and individual perspective are neglected. Content brought to the learner very often meets neither the individual competency gaps nor the organizational learning goals. Time passed between acquisition and application of knowledge is too long. In short, business processes on the one side and learning&#8209;related processes on the other are not aligned adequately. Thus, we see an urgent need for concepts on how to derive corporate training actions from business tasks in order to improve employees' business performance. This paper presents an integrated approach for competency&#8209; and business process&#8209;driven learning management supported by information technology (IT), developed within two projects named PROLIX and EXPLAIN.

Abstract:
To improve the management of hybrid courses, the relationship between learner characteristics and learning performance was analyzed in two regular university courses. Undergraduate and graduate students participated in two 15&#8209;week hybrid courses which consisted of face&#8209;to&#8209;face lectures (Information Industrial issues), and the corresponding modules with online test. Subjects included 36 freshmen and 48 graduate students. Learner characteristics, consisting of motivation, personality, thinking styles and learners? impression of their e&#8209;Learning experiences were measured at the beginning and end of the term. Additional data was collected from the number of days attended, the number of modules completed, test scores and final grades for the course. Final assessment grades for the class were also analyzed. There was no significant difference in learner characteristics between bachelors and masters students who completed the course. There was no significant difference in learner characteristics between bachelor and master students, but there were some differences in conscientiousness scores between masters and bachelor students and between those who received a final grade of A and B. Scores on "learning strategy" as a factor to indicate learning experience were in favour of master students. Master students? evaluation of their e&#8209;Learning experience increased significantly throughout the course. Conscientiousness (one of the five factors in the personality construct) correlated positively with the number of e&#8209; Learning modules completed by master students (r=0.35). They seem to understand better the benefits of e&#8209;Learning experience and being the more motivated students, they applied what they have learned from previous e&#8209;Learning experiences more effectively. Students with high grades evaluated their e&#8209;Learning experience positively and had significantly higher conscientiousness scores than master students who received lower grades (p

Lecture Recording: Structural and Symbolic Information vs. Flexibility of Presentation
Pages:
pp219&#8209;226
Authors:
Daniel Stolzenberg
Stefan Pforte
Abstract:
Rapid eLearning is an ongoing trend which enables flexible and cost&#8209;effective creation of learning materials. Especially, lecture recording has turned out to be a lightweight method particularly suited for existing lectures and blended learning strategies. In order to not only sequentially playback but offer full fledged navigation, search and inspection of the recorded lecture, chapter marks and search indices have to be embedded. To solve this, two basic approaches for lecture recording tools can be identified â€” both of them having certain advantages and drawbacks. On the one hand there are systems based on symbolic representation of common slideshow formats like MS PowerPoint. Therefore, they preserve structure and symbol information contained therein, but are lacking flexibility of supported dynamic and interactive formats. On the other hand there are systems based on pixel representation and screen grabbing technologies. While supporting any presentation content, structural and symbolic information cannot be extracted directly and thus has to be post&#8209;processed from the recorded video. This paper discusses a perspective of combining these approaches by widening the slide&#8209;metaphor to a more flexible scene&#8209;based presentation, preserving both the structural and symbolic information. One possible attempt for this is identified by introducing a browser&#8209;based scene concept. Symbolic information can be directly extracted from the XHTML source code and structural information derives from switching through scenes. The browser itself is capable of presenting a wide range of dynamic and interactive formats, thus offering more flexible presentations. For approving the proposed concepts, a prototype called "Virtual Overhead" was developed and evaluated.

Help! Active Student Learning and Error Remediation in an Online Calculus e&#8209;Help Community
Pages:
pp227&#8209;238
Authors:
Carla van de Sande
Gaea Leinhardt
Abstract:
Free, open, online homework help sites appear to be extremely popular and exist for many school subjects. Students can anonymously post problems at their convenience and receive responses from forum members. This mode of tutoring may be especially critical for school subjects such as calculus that are intrinsically challenging and have high attrition rates. However, educational research has focused on tutoring sessions that instruct students on a pre&#8209;determined set of material or topics, and there has been no systematic research on these dynamic, free, open, online tutoring communities. In order to distinguish the student&#8209;initiated e&#8209;help episodes from traditional tutoring sessions, we refer to them as "tutorettes."   Each tutorette was assigned a participation code that contained information on the number of contributions by each participant, the sequence of contributions, and the number of different participants. Student problem solving activity, defined by mathematical contributions and efforts, was measured for initial postings and for subsequent contributions. Finally, each tutorette was examined for evidence of mathematical errors and these were classified according to type: pre&#8209;calculus, operational, and conceptual. A tutorette on the limit concept is provided to demonstrate how mathematical queries are resolved in an SOH e&#8209;help community.  Participation and problem solving attempts provided evidence of active student learning. Instead of simply using the tutors to do their homework, many students made initial attempts at solutions, queried tutor responses, and applied the help they received to make progress on solving problems. This behaviour appeared to be influenced by the actions of the tutor: Providing solution sketches accompanied by asking direct questions encouraged dialogue, whereas providing quasi&#8209;complete worked solutions seemed to have the opposite effect.   In contrast to classroom instruction, students in this e&#8209;help community appeared comfortable in presenting incorrect work and tutors were open and forthright in their commentaries, evaluations, and explanations. In addition, tutors modulated their responses according to the type of error. Pre&#8209;calculus errors and operational (calculus) errors were not accorded the same depth of explanation as conceptual misunderstandings.

Abstract:
The Scottish Science and Technology Network (SSTN) is a major collaboration between Careers Scotland and Scottish industry to promote science and technology via an on&#8209;line and integrated learning programme. An initial two&#8209; year pilot project has grown considerably and has now been running for over 7 years. The SSTN programme is a web&#8209; based application that supports teachers with automatic identification of learning resources, course planning tools, classroom&#8209;based delivery (within the 5&#8209;14 curriculum) and mentoring support. This paper presents a summary of this project and examples of typical usage scenarios. We present our project findings from this 7 year programme and details of our further development plans. Findings presented include lessons learnt, our best practice guidelines, effective user interface design for learning, integration learning resources and strategies for hiding complexity.

Authors:
Joan Burgess
Abstract:
In order to become a UK Nurse Prescriber, a First Level Registered Nurse must undergo an approved University based educational programme, which consists of theory, and a period of practice supervised by doctors. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) requires nurses undertaking this programme to have some formal university attendance and to be assessed in practice. Successful students are recorded on the national NMC register. Since October 2004, the University of Winchester has used blended learning incorporating e&#8209;learning for the delivery of the Nurse Prescribing Programme using online material developed by Emap Publishing in conjunction with the University of Stirling. This paper discusses the effectiveness of the programme and the evaluation of the initial six cohorts students).

Exploring Virtual Opportunities to Enhance and Promote an Emergent Community of Practice
Pages:
pp261&#8209;270
Authors:
Kathy Courtney
Abstract:
This paper gives an account of an attempt by an educational developer to support and strengthen an emergent Community of Practice (CoP) (Wenger 1998a). This community consists of members of staff associated in different capacities with the Centre for Interprofessional e&#8209;Learning (CIPeL), a Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL), based at Coventry University and Sheffield Hallam University. The support is specifically targeting CIPeL Secondees who are recruited to CIPeL on a part&#8209;time basis, for the purpose of creating interprofessional Learning Objects (LOs). While Secondees receive individual support, there is little formal contact between Secondees. An online CIPeL Community site was created, in order to provide a space where CIPeL members could meet virtually and share problems and experiences relating to the construction of LOs. Initially, the key question appeared to be how online participation by members of the community could be encouraged. Using Wenger's (1998a) CoP theory of learning, and after exploring how the Community site was being used, the focus of attention shifts to an exploration of reified objects and the role they play in guiding practice, which in this case relates to the creation and use of interprofessional LOs. This in turns leads to the difficult question of how relevant reified objects may be identified and built, and it is advocated that existing CIPeL LOs should be exploited as reified objects for the purpose of guiding the construction of new LOs. It is felt that invoking constructs from Wenger's (1998a) CoP theory of learning has resulted in a more detailed picture of the nature of the challenges involved in moving from an emergent CoP to more established practice. The approach has simultaneously helped clarify how support for an emergent CoP might be more effectively focused. As a final point, it is suggested that it may be fruitful to explore parallels between CIPeL as an emergent CoP and interprofessional practice (IPP) itself, based on the view that IPP is also an emergent practice.

Issues Around Creating a Reusable Learning Object to Support Statistics Teaching
Pages:
pp271&#8209;278
Authors:
Mollie Gilchrist
Abstract:
Although our health professional students have some experience of simple charts, such as pie and bar, and some intuition of histograms, they do not appear to have much knowledge or understanding about box and whisker plots and their relation to the data they are describing or compared to histograms. The boxplot is a versatile charting tool, useful for presenting data from surveys and any other projects, where a reasonable quantity of data has been collected.  An opportunity arose to create a reusable learning object (RLO) to describe, explore, and interpret boxplots, especially in relation to their data and summary statistics. Examples included interprofessional learning, as this was the main remit of the Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning, from which funding was obtained. The RLO is aimed at both undergraduate and post&#8209;graduate HP students, who would be able to use the resource flexibly, to augment their limited exposure to statistical techniques, and add to their appreciation of IP learning and working.  The RLO includes animation and opportunities for students to interact with the resource. Existing, available 'real' data, collected as part of research projects concerning (IP) learning, as well as generated data, is used as illustrative material.   This paper explores some of the issues raised during the creation of the RLO, and presents limited feedback from users. Issues raised include the working of the project team, delivery platform, copyright and intellectual property rights and software incompatibilities. To date, feedback from colleagues and students has been very positive and has encouraged further improvements.  The creation of this RLO has been a longer and more time&#8209;consuming experience than anticipated, and has highlighted the importance of a team approach, with constant reviewing. It will be interesting to see how the RLO will be used, and usage will be evaluated in the future.

Abstract:
This paper presents qualitative research completed in two groups of hospitals in the United Kingdom, as part of a larger mixed methods study. It involved eight qualified nurses caring for patients with gastro&#8209;intestinal cancer in general surgical wards. It explored the nurses' experiences of using an online programme and their perceptions of the impact of learning on patient care delivery. The nurses volunteered to complete an online open source package www.cancernursing.org. and meet for focus group discussions and interviews following a lapse of six weeks. Two of the participants experienced difficulties completing the package and following changes to the previously attained ethical approval, a focus group was conducted with these staff. Analysis of the transcripts identified a number of issues for those considering the adoption of such modes of delivery within healthcare. Nurses referred to a lack of information technology skills and competence in computer use, access issues, organizational barriers and lack of protected study time. In spite of difficulties they gave examples of how their learning had impacted on patient care.

Abstract:
The main objective of this pilot research project was to determine whether the use of an internet broadband link to stream physiotherapy clinical education workshop proceedings in "real&#8209;time" is of equivalent educational value to the traditional face&#8209;to&#8209;face experience. This project looked at the benefits of using the above technology as an educational tool and its impact on educators only, it did not investigate possible related factors such as the cost of employing this technology nor the technicalities of setting up the proposed technology as these objectives were beyond the scope of the study. In 2006 three physiotherapy educators' workshops were selected for streaming at the University of Canberra. Two groups of educators attended the workshops at geographically separate venues, face&#8209;to&#8209;face (on&#8209;site) and real&#8209;time internet streaming (off&#8209;site). Group one (on&#8209;site) attended face&#8209;to&#8209;face lectures at the Canberra Hospital ACT Australia; lectures were streamed using a standard personal computer and digital camera to group two (off&#8209;site) at the University of Canberra and Calvary Hospital ACT. At the end of the workshops all participants completed the questionnaire survey. Obtained results were analyzed using t&#8209;tests. No significant difference was found between the participants' assessment of the educational value derived from either off or on&#8209;site attendance at the workshop.

On the Road to Virtual Europe â€” Redux
Pages:
pp297&#8209;304
Authors:
Andy Pulman
Abstract:
Virtual Europe is a web&#8209;based European community from which health education scenarios may be accessed for learning and teaching purposes. Featuring a map giving access to country specific resources, it is populated with different cultural case studies allowing contrasts between cultures to be examined. For example, a student could evaluate the differences between UK, Belgium and Dutch approaches to the care of a patient in a particular situation. The project is initially funded by the Consortium of Institutes of Higher Education in Health and Rehabilitation In Europe (Cohehre).  This paper offers a unique view on the benefits and limitations surrounding the development and implementation of a European health based virtual community. How will it facilitate the elimination of barriers for international mobility of students and staff? How easy is it to integrate into differing European health curricula? How does it compare to the experiences offered by new virtual environments?   During the first year, the pilot version of Virtual Europe was created incorporating cardiac and burns case studies. During the second year of the project, the aim is to refine the pilot and incorporate further case studies. During the third year of the project, Virtual Europe will be utilised within partner institutions as a learning and teaching tool. The project team are working to evaluate the user&#8209;friendliness of the system on an on&#8209;going basis encouraging feedback from the students and academics that will use it. Tutorials will be used to evaluate how successfully lecturers are able to utilise and integrate it within their curriculum. Evaluation will be iterative and formative, with feedback used to identify potential changes that will be incorporated into subsequent pilots, group sessions and system enhancements.   The paper presents a cogent and stimulating analysis of an e&#8209;Learning virtual health education project which is interprofessional in outlook; interdisciplinary in approach; intercultural in background; interactive in design and international in scope.

Abstract:
This paper explores evaluation strategies to gauge the impact of a novel instructional design on international community participation online. This is done by conceptualizing and devising indicators for measuring "engagement" online amongst marginalized adult communities worldwide. In doing so, a review of online evaluation literature is conducted. In comparing dialogue sessions based on an ongoing traditional model to the new instructional approach, various challenges are faced in "measuring" asynchronous discussion. While the initial findings of marginal increase in engagement with the adapted instructional approach is not sufficient to prove that the new model works, this paper demonstrates various strategies challenges in evaluating dialectic engagement.

Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the use of e&#8209;learning in secondary education. It is based on research that has taken place over a period of two years with students aged 14&#8209;16 (Key Stage 4). The paper considers the current research in e&#8209;learning and identifies the challenges faced by students, the changing role of the learner, and the impact e&#8209; learning can have on students. The author argues that preparation needs to be carried out at the school level prior to introducing e&#8209;learning into the Key Stage 4 curriculum. It concludes by discussing the findings of the research which identifies a range of issues schools may want to consider, when embracing e&#8209;learning.

Abstract:
Using information technology to support teaching and learning is becoming ubiquitous in tertiary education.  However, how students participate and perform when a major component of the learning experience is conducted via an online learning environment is still an open question. The objective of this study was to investigate any relationships between the participation, demographics and academic performance of students in an information technology course that was taught wholly online. Through a detailed analysis of tracking data of student participation, which was automatically collected by the online learning environment, it was found that a relationship existed between students' participation in the online learning environment and their performance, as measured by final results in the course. Relationships also existed between gender, nationality, participation and performance. However, there was no relationship between age and performance and participation. These findings suggest that when designing online learning for a diverse population, student demographics should be taken into account to maximise the benefits of the learning experience.

Abstract:
e&#8209;Learning, of late, has been witnessing an unprecedented expansion as an opportunity for higher education. This expanding alternative mode calls for ensuring and imparting a sound and qualitative education. The present study made an attempt to investigate the issues related to the quality dimensions of e&#8209;learning. Our results revealed the presence of both strengths and weaknesses in the e&#8209;learning system. It is interesting to note, that the e&#8209;learners have expressed diverse opinions with regard to administrative issues, instruction materials, instructors' support, viper sessions (VIPER, Voice Internet Protocol Extended Reach is a software which helps interactive learning through the Internet) , grading and assessment. The findings of the study further demonstrate that if the concept of e&#8209;learning is imparted with a better approach and perspective, the reach will be phenomenal. This study reiterates the relevance of imparting qualitative education through e&#8209;learning.

Abstract:
In order to promote closer relations between two existing academic environments â€” on&#8209;campus and distance learning â€” a pedagogical intervention was made aiming to raise the level of competence and awareness among faculty regarding flexible learning and the use of ICT in higher education. The intervention was a process&#8209;oriented pedagogical effort based on collaborative learning and cross&#8209;institutional cooperation. Teacher teams worked to enhance flexible learning in either new or existing courses. The intervention resulted in more teachers getting involved in flexible learning. At the same time several problems surfaced indicating the need for further competence development efforts in order to further promote flexible learning environments.

Abstract:
This is a comparison of Instructivist and constructivist pedagogical approaches and their applications in different situations, which make clear the comparative advantages of both approaches. Instructivist learning, places the teacher in authority while the constructivist shifted authority to no one in particular but shared responsibilities between learner and teacher in such a manner that the teacher no longer assumes the responsibilities of the passage of informationknowledge to the learner but only guides him to discover the 'objective truth' out there and in the attainment of learning objectives. Teaching and Learning process was redefined in the light of 'new' understanding in teaching and learning and practical applications of these pedagogical approaches were considered. I presented a study guide (Appendix 1) as an example of socio&#8209;constructivist pedagogy where emphasis in on learning rather than on teaching.

Title:
A Sociological Inquiry into Time Management in Postgraduate Studies by e&#8209;Learning in Greece

pp66&#8209;75
Authors:
Marios Vryonides
Abstract:
This paper presents the findings from a small scale sociological investigation which studied the way mature students manage their time while attending to postgraduate studies by e&#8209;learning. Thirty postgraduate students from the University of the Aegean, Greece, were asked to record their daily activities using a semi&#8209;structured time&#8209;use diary over a period when the demands of the course were at their peak. Follow up interviews with the students were conducted once they handed in their diaries whereby they were asked to reflect on their recorded activities. Two groups of students have emerged from analysing the diaries as having distinctive patterns of time usage; namely, married women with children and married men and single individuals. Policy implications are discussed, as the disparities in the experience of attending to e&#8209;learning programmes while at home constitute a severe source of resistance to the stated aim of e&#8209; learning programmes, which is to overcome social and geographical marginalisation.

Title:
Measuring Success in e&#8209;Learning â€” A Multi&#8209;Dimensional Approach
Pages:
pp99&#8209;110
Authors:
Malcolm Bell
Stephen Farrier
Abstract:
In 1999 Northumbria University published a strategy document entitled "Towards the web&#8209;enabled University". This prefaced an assessment of need and of available platforms for developing online teaching and learning which, in turn, led in 2001 to the roll out and institution&#8209;wide adoption of the Blackboard Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) now referred to as our eLearning Platform or eLP. Within a very few years we had over 90% take&#8209;up by academic staff and the eLP had become integral to the learning of virtually all our students. What has always been relatively easy to measure has been the number of users, frequency of use, number of courses, levels of technological infrastructure, etc. However, with the publication of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) e learning strategy in 2005 it became apparent that such quantitative data was not particularly helpful in measuring how the university matched onto the 10&#8209;year aspirations of that document and its measures of success. Consequently an on&#8209;going exploration was embarked upon to try to measure where we were and what we should prioritise in order to embed e&#8209;learning, as envisaged within the HEFCE strategy. This involved a number of key approaches: The measures were broken down into manageable sizes, creating sixteen measures in all with descriptors for "full achievement" through to "no progress to date" with suggested sources of information which would support the description. A series of interviews with key staff were set up in which they were asked to rank where they felt the university stood against each measure and what evidence would support their views. An academic staff survey was developed on&#8209;line which invited staff to explore a number of statements based around the HEFCE criteria and express degrees of agreement. This was followed up by a range of face&#8209;to&#8209;face interviews. An online student survey was developed and students were asked to express degrees of agreement with these. Student responses were followed up with an independent student focus group exploring issues in greater depth. The outcomes of the three approaches were then combined and an interim report prepared which identified strengths and areas for further development. Some of the latter are already being addressed. Subsequently, the university joined phase 2 of a national benchmarking e&#8209;learning in Higher Education exercise, running from May to December 2007, supported by the Higher Education Academy (HEA) and the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC). During this exercise we engaged in a deeper exploration against a wider set of criteria, based upon the "Pick & Mix" (Bacsich, 2007) methodology. Pick&Mix comprises 20 core criteria and the option of a number of supplementary criteria. Through these approaches we will be able to set a baseline for where we currently are and it will allow us to revisit criteria later to measure our progress in those areas we identify for development. This paper shares methodologies used, identifies key outcomes and reflects upon those outcomes from both an institutional and sectoral perspective.

Title:
Is a Blended Learning Approach Suitable for Mature, Part&#8209;time Finance Students?
Pages:
pp111&#8209;118
Authors:
Julia Burgess
Abstract:
Blended learning is a pedagogy that is sometimes heralded as the answer to some of the problems which part time students face. Creating a module for part&#8209;time students with some e&#8209;learning elements is time consuming and resource intensive. Therefore it must be demonstrated that the investment in such innovations will benefit the students and create wider learning opportunities in the most effective manner. A small investigation has been conducted which has looked at the learning needs of part&#8209;time finance students at The University of Winchester to see whether a blended approach would have benefited their studies. The results of this investigation have been used as the basis for developing the course to allow a more blended style. This paper attempts to outline how the course was designed and to do a preliminary analysis of the use of blended learning for part&#8209;time mature finance students.

Engaging the YouTube Google&#8209;Eyed Generation: Strategies for Using Web 2.0 in Teaching and Learning
Pages:
pp119&#8209;130
Authors:
Peter Duffy
Abstract:
YouTube, Podcasting, Blogs, Wikis and RSS are buzz words currently associated with the term Web 2.0 and represent a shifting pedagogical paradigm for the use of a new set of tools within education.  The implication here is a possible shift from the basic archetypical vehicles used for (e)learning today (lecture notes, printed material, PowerPoint, websites, animation) towards a ubiquitous user&#8209;centric, user&#8209;content generated and user&#8209; guided experience.   It is not sufficient to use online learning and teaching technologies simply for the delivery of content to students. A new "Learning Ecology" is present where these Web 2.0 technologies can be explored for collaborative and (co)creative purposes as well as for the critical assessment, evaluation and personalization of information.   Web 2.0 technologies provide educators with many possibilities for engaging students in desirable practices such as collaborative content creation, peer assessment and motivation of students through innovative use of media. These can be used in the development of authentic learning tasks and enhance the learning experience.   However in order for a new learning tool, be it print, multimedia, blog, podcast or video, to be adopted, educators must be able to conceptualize the possibilities for use within a concrete framework. This paper outlines some possible strategies for educators to incorporate the use of some of these Web 2.0 technologies into the student learning experience.

Abstract:
Addressing the problems of bullying in schools, this paper presents a novel and highly innovative pedagogical approach, building on the immersive power of virtual role&#8209;play. Educational role&#8209;play is widely accepted as a powerful instrument to change attitudes and behaviour, but faces some difficulties and disadvantages when applied to sensitive social issues in the classroom. This paper shows how the FearNot! software application, developed within the scope of the EU&#8209;funded projects VICTEC (Virtual ICT with Empathic Characters) and eCIRCUS (Education through Characters with emotional&#8209;Intelligence and Role&#8209;playing Capabilities that Understand Social interaction) uses virtual role&#8209;play and autonomous agents to provide children aged eight to eleven years of age with the opportunity to visit a virtual school environment populated by 3D animated synthetic characters that engage in bullying episodes.  The characters' actions and the storyline are created as improvised dramas by use of emergent narrative, resulting in unscripted and highly believable interaction experiences for the learner. While the students are spectators to the bullying episodes that unfold among the FearNot! characters, the victimised character starts a conversation with the student in between the episodes, describing their experiences with bullying and how they feel as a result to it, and asking the student for advice. The aim of this approach and particularly of this interaction sequence in between the virtual bullying episodes is to sensitise primary school students to the potential problems that victims of persistent aggressive behaviour are facing: By triggering an empathic relationship between learners and characters, learners understand and vicariously feel into the plight of the victimised character. Empirical evidence from bullying research implies that bullies are regularly reinforced by bystanders that witness the bullying and turn their attention to it, but do not actively intervene to end it (Craig & Pepler 1996; Lean 1998; Salmivalli 1999; Hawkins et al. 2001). Hence, this intervention strategy targets these bystanders to stand up to the bully and help the victim, due to their heightened awareness and sensitivity to the grave consequences victims face.  Preliminary evaluation results indicate that the children were willing to immerse themselves in the virtual drama and that they empathically engage with the characters, attributing a range of emotions to the characters depending on the events that happen within the respective scenario. An ongoing long&#8209;term intervention in school in the UK and Germany covers several interactions with the software over a ten week period of time.

Behind the Scenes with OpenLearn: the Challenges of Researching the Provision of Open Educational Resources

Andreia Santos
Abstract:
Web&#8209;enabled technology is now being applied on a large scale. In this paper we look at open access provision of teaching and learning leading to many users with varying patterns and motivations for use. This has provided us with a research challenge to find methods that help us understand and explain such initiatives. We describe ways to model the research and identify where pressures and contradictions can be found, drawing on a reflective view of our own practice in performing the research. Open educational resources are defined as technology&#8209;enabled educational resources that are openly available for consultation, use and adaptation by users for non&#8209;commercial purposes (UNESCO, 2002). OpenLearn is one of the largest of such initiatives and is committed to the provision of open educational resources for all. It is being developed by The Open University and is primarily sponsored by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. It provides users with over 4 200 hours of higher educational material drawn from Open University courses. Other learning tools such as discussion forums, video conferencing, and knowledge mapping software are also available to the user. In this paper we aim to introduce OpenLearn and outline some of the main research issues surrounding such an initiative. We seek to explore theoretical and practical approaches that can provide suitable tools for analysis. Activity theory is seen as a suitable approach for macro analysis and its use is illustrated in terms of the complexity of large scale research. Activity theory, besides informing research perspectives, can be turned in upon the research process itself allowing us to consider the challenges and context of the research. By using activity theory in this way and illustrating from a range of practical approaches we demonstrate and illustrate a useful research approach.

Abstract:
e&#8209;Learning implementation is an area in progress that continues to evolve with time and further research. Researchers in the field argue that e&#8209;Learning is still in its infancy, resulting into numerous implementation strategies across a wide e&#8209;Learning spectrum. This paper explores the e&#8209;Learning state of art. It provides a general overview of the learning process, evaluates some current implementation trends pointing out a range of frameworks and strategies used in the past decade. It further looks at the changes created by the adoption of e&#8209;Learning within the higher education process. This is followed by an identification of emerging issues from which two problems are identified; 1) the limited uptake of technology as an instruction delivery method; and 2) the ineffective use of technology to support learning. In respect to this, future research should therefore seek to further investigate these aspects and to explore suitable approaches for effective implementation of e&#8209;Learning to support learning. Not the least in higher education contexts.

Title:
Cultural Impact on Online Education Quality Perception
Pages:

Authors:
Manuela Milani
Abstract:
Numerous stakeholders in the field of education have been working on the development and extent of the use of ICT in different learning communities (higher education, vocational training) and in different multicultural contexts thanks also to EU funding opportunities.   In this framework, they have participated in the building of various cross&#8209;national teaching and learning models.   The strategies which supported the development of such educational projects introducing online teaching and learning activities in the framework of European projects generally rely on the basic premise of the homogeneity of the educational systems likely to be used, and according to similar methods, the resources and training devices with ICT. This can lead to the negation of potential discrepancies, particularly cultural ones, in educational systems.  The aim of this paper is to analyse the concept of "quality in online education within European Online Academic Education's context", how this concept takes shape and how it becomes â€” or not â€” part of teaching and learning practices. We decided to focus our attention on the concept of "quality" to understand the eventual impact of the cultural factor on the developing scenario of virtual education because this concept seems to be particularly revealing if we take into consideration its "open nature".  The increasing number of virtual campuses reveals how common the development of teaching modules are nowadays together with complete degrees based on inter&#8209;university and transnational collaborations with the aim of transferring learning objects from one educational context to another. Virtual mobility is thus becoming a reality for a greater number of students.  However, the multicultural dimension of these new environments has not been investigated yet and in particular the notion of "online teaching quality" is still under&#8209;exploited.  This paper intends to provide a review of current works on Online Education Quality Measurement in general focusing on the investigation of Cultural Impact on Quality issues. At the same time this paper intends to shift the attention from students' to teachers' perception of quality and consequently on the possible different evaluation frameworks used within the same context: European Online Education.  The paper is part of a PhD research aimed at exploring the impact of cultural dimensions on the design of online courses offered by universities from different European areas. The research notably aims to reveal differences between online courses' models, in order to uncover which one of them can be connected to the cultural dimension they belong to.

Meeting the Training Needs of SMEs: Is e&#8209;Learning a Solution?

Abstract:
Training is one of the basic means of human resources development in business organizations, aiming to motivate employees, to develop their potential and to help them perform better. The end of the 20th century has seen the advent of globalisation and the diffusion of new information and communication technologies. Businesses have to change and adapt to the requirements of the new knowledge&#8209;based and skill&#8209;based economy. Facing pressures from an increasingly competitive business environment, small and medium&#8209;sized enterprises (SMEs) are called upon to implement strategies that are enabled and supported by information technologies and e&#8209;business applications in order to compete with others' organizations. One of these applications is e&#8209;Learning, whose aim is to enable the continuous assimilation of knowledge and skills by managers and employees, and thus support organisational training and development efforts through the use of the Internet and Web technologies. Little is known however as to the level of awareness of e&#8209;Learning in SMEs and as to the actual role played by e&#8209;Learning with regard to these firms' training needs. A multiple case study of sixteen SMEs in the Atlantic region of Canada, including twelve that use e&#8209;Learning with varying degrees of intensity, was designed to explore this question. We observed the firms' training process, identifying to what extent the SMEs know and use e&#8209;Learning, and to what extent e&#8209;Learning meets their training needs.

Developing Critically Thoughtful, Media&#8209;Rich Lessons in Science: Process and Product
Pages:
pp161&#8209;170
Authors:
Philip Balcaen
Abstract:
In this paper, I describe a professional development approach and a conceptual framework used to create critically thoughtful and media&#8209;rich science learning resources. Greater clarity about the nature of critical thinking and how to support teachers in learning to implement it are needed if we are to respond to broader calls for critical thinking both as a central goal in science education and as a key aspect in the ecology of 21st Century e&#8209;learning environments. The conceptual framework is a model of critical thinking developed by the Canadian Critical Thinking Consortium that involves embedding the teaching of five categories of intellectual tools into the teaching of curriculum content. The "tools for thought" include addressing the need for focused and relevant background knowledge, criteria for judgment, thinking concepts, thinking strategies and the development of habits of mind. The professional development approach engages practicing teachers through focused inquiry groups in collaboration with rich media technicians to develop the e&#8209;critical challenges (lessons). Aspects of this "comet approach" include a series of face&#8209;to&#8209;face sessions, gradual and planned for introduction to use of laptop computers, developing inquiry oriented writing teams and expert mentorship between large group face&#8209;to&#8209;face sessions. I explain the unique aspects of both the development process and the challenges in the context of a project involving twelve teachers in the creation of media&#8209;rich critical thinking lessons in science for Grade 7 students. Although project assessment data analysis is currently underway, I offer several initial conclusions in relation to the four goals of the project.

Abstract:
Drawing on what researchers and professionals in the field internationally report, this paper reviews educational technology as an emergent field. The review reveals the continuum of perspectives on what the field is, and how it is bounded or fragmented. The paper describes the field from two perspectives: the professional and scholarly and considers how the forms of knowledge differ and overlap in each domain. It posits some dichotomies which may frame the field such as science social science and positivist post&#8209;modernist. Finally the paper provides conceptual frameworks for distinguishing fields from each other and suggests what the categorisation of the field might mean, especially considering its emergent status in a rapidly changing context.

IT Worked for Us: Online Strategies to Facilitate Learning in Large (Undergraduate) Classes

Authors:
F. Greyling

A. Makka
S. van Niekerk
Abstract:
Higher education institutions are compelled to accommodate growing class sizes as student numbers have increased over time, especially at undergraduate level. Good teaching principles are relevant to all class sizes. For example, teachers of all classes are required to create safe learning environments, motivate and engage students, interact with students, provide stimulating assessment tasks and give prompt feedback. However, meeting these requirements in the context of large classes is more challenging. As a result, traditional large class teaching methods are often characterised by the passive absorption of material, which is not ideal.  What constitutes a large class? Class sizes of 60 or more have been considered large. In this paper, we report on online teaching, learning and assessment strategies for classes made up of approximately 600 first year students in Business Management 1 offered at the University of Johannesburg, South Africa.   The purpose of this ongoing research project is to integrate educational technologies in the classroom and study the impact of these classroom changes on the students' learning experience. The programme, which blends face&#8209;to&#8209;face teaching, paper&#8209;based teaching materials and online learning by means of WebCTBlackboard tools, is now in its second cycle of implementation. This teaching strategy aims at greater lecturer&#8209;student interaction, engaging students with the course materials on a regular basis and eliciting feedback from students, which is used to re&#8209;teach concepts that the students find particularly difficult.   The blended learning strategy resulted in enhanced student perceptions of the quality of teaching and learning, and a significant improvement in student throughput. The findings and recommendations reported in the paper are based on student feedback, gleaned through online surveys, online artefacts created by students and lecturers' classroom experiences.   Although the authors report on online teaching, learning and assessment practices that proved to be effective in large classes, many conclusions may be of relevance to smaller classes.

Personal Learning Journal â€” Course Design for Using Weblogs in Higher Education

pp189&#8209;196
Authors:
Stefanie Hain
Andrea Back
Abstract:
This paper examines the impact of weblogs on individual learning processes in a university environment. It outlines experiences with weblogs as an instrument of learning reflection or a learning journal. This paper presents an innovative didactical concept based on the Web 2.0 paradigm and evolving technologies. Weblogs have emerged with the paradigm of Web 2.0 and user&#8209;generated content and have gained in importance through the various evolving application contexts, for example, the transfer of knowledge within enterprises, the communication and exchange of experiences with customers, and even the acquisition of projects by power bloggers. In this paper, weblogs are considered in the specificity of learning journals that focus on two objectives: first, supporting individual learning by means of reflection as the most effective method of individual learning; and, second, multiplying these efforts through interaction and discussion within a group of individuals with common interests. The latter is based on contribution&#8209;based pedagogies that maintain that collaboratively creating learning resources and sharing them with others are promising practices through which students can learn. Additionally, it is argued that this style of teaching relates to a growing trend in higher education in which the focus of learning is moving away from building a basic knowledge store and toward emphasizing a wider range of skills. We successfully applied the weblog approach to several academic courses during which qualitative and quantitative data were collected in an empirical study. This paper reflects our experiences with weblogs as a support for university lectures and is based on four semesters of exploration and adaptation. Within the scope of the research approach of design research (Hevner et al. 2004), it provides a structured method to support individual learning processes within a learning community realized by a weblog in the specificity of a learning journal. Verification with students and experts has led to a holistic method through which lecturers and coaches can successfully integrate weblogs into academic courses or even professional trainings. This paper addresses both academic learning and professional education management initiatives. Essentially, it aims at in&#8209;house trainings in enterprises, vocational schools, and universities. Interviews with experts will also reveal how to successfully align this method with professional trainings. In conclusion, this paper suggests a method with which to design a learning environment by means of learning journals to enforce increased individual learning. More specifically, it reveals that learning journals enable the achievement of level three (transfer to and application in the working environment) of Kirkpatrick's (1994) four&#8209;level model, which was generated to evaluate learning programs.

The eLIDA CAMEL Nomadic Model of Collaborative Partnership for a Community of Practice in Design for Learning

pp197&#8209;206
Authors:
Jill Jameson
Abstract:
A nomadic collaborative partnership model for a community of practice (CoP) in Design for Learning (D4L) can facilitate successful innovation and continuing appraisals of effective professional practice, stimulated by a 'critical friend' assigned to the project. This paper reports on e&#8209;learning case studies collected by the UK JISC eLIDA CAMEL Design for Learning project, which implemented and evaluated learning design (LD) tools in higher and further education as part of the 2006&#8209;07 JISC Design for Learning pedagogic e&#8209;learning programme. Project partners carried out user evaluations on innovative tools with a learning design function, collecting D4L case studies and LD sequences in post&#8209;16HE contexts using LAMS and Moodle. The project brought together learning activity sequences from post&#8209;16HE partners into a collaborative e&#8209;learning community of professional practice based on the CAMEL (Collaborative Approaches to the Management of e&#8209;Learning) model, contributing to international D4L developments. This paper briefly provides an overview of key project output contributions to e&#8209;learning innovations, including results from teacher and student evaluations using online surveys. The paper explores intentionality in the development of a community of practice in design for learning, reporting on trials of learning design and social software that bridged some of the tensions between formalised intra&#8209;institutional e&#8209;learning relationships and inter&#8209;institutional project team dynamic D4L practitioner development. Following a brief report of practitioner D4L e&#8209;learning case studies and student feedback, the catalytic role of the 'critical friend' is highlighted and recommended as a key ingredient in the successful development of a nomadic model of communities of practice in the management of professional e&#8209;learning projects. eLIDA CAMEL Partners included the Association of Learning Technology (ALT), JISC infoNet, three universities and five FESixth Form Colleges. Results reported to the UK JISC Experts' Pedagogy Group demonstrated e&#8209;learning innovations by practitioners in D4L case studies, illuminated by the role of the 'critical friend', Professor Mark Stiles of Staffordshire University. The project also benefited from case study evaluations by Dr Liz Masterman of Oxford University Learning Technologies Group and the leading work of ALT and JISC infoNet in the development of the CAMEL model.

Abstract:
This paper reports on the initial findings from a project which offers a complementary perspective to much of the research on e&#8209;learning and student learning in a digital age. Rather than foregrounding technological applications and their associated affordances, its focus is on texts and practices and textual engagements in digital environments. Drawing on previous research into academic literacies (Lea & Street 1998; Lea & Stierer 2000; Lillis, 2001; Thesen & Van Pletzen 2006), it takes a textual lens to the experience of undergraduate students' learning in a digital age. The project contributes to our understanding of a changing environment in exploring the nature of literacies, learning and technologies and how these intersect in students' lives as learners.   The research has been carried out in three very different institutions of higher education in the UK, using qualitative, text&#8209; based methods. Forty&#8209;five undergraduates participated in the project and were interviewed on three occasions over a six month period. The interviews included discussions around their use of digital texts and technologies in their lives as students. In discussion with the research team, participants in the project accessed websites across a range of personal and curricular spheres, including social networking sites and resources directly or indirectly linked to their studies. They also showed examples of their work for assessment and guidance from tutors. This has provided a rich base from which to examine the nature of digital literacies for today's undergraduates and the implications of engagement in a range of texts and practices around technologies for learning.

Navigating the e&#8209;Learning Terrain: Aligning Technology, Pedagogy and Context

Abstract:
Over the last ten years e&#8209;learning has rapidly emerged as a potentially effective mode of higher education, but it is still unclear what factors are important in the design of an effective e&#8209;learning course. e&#8209;Learning has been described as being a "disruptive technology" that changes how learning is approached in higher education (Garrison and Anderson 2003). The extensive changes in the technologies over the last decade have the potential to influence the way we engage with knowledge, but the potential will only be realised if we integrate this with an understanding of learning, and design the use of e&#8209;learning technologies accordingly within different contexts (Laurillard 2005). This paper explores the influence of the areas of technology, pedagogy and context on e&#8209;learning practice in higher education. Three vignettes relating to e&#8209;learning are presented which represent the shifts in technology and the tensions and influences of this on context and pedagogy. These vignettes provide the background context within which to discuss the design of an e&#8209; learning alignment guide (eLAG). This guide is a navigational tool, which offers e&#8209;learning designers a perspective on navigating the e&#8209;learning topography. It is devised to assist practitioners when navigating the changing and complex terrain of e&#8209;learning and teaching. The key finding of this paper is that technology, pedagogy and context need to be closely aligned in order to realise the potential of e&#8209;learning in higher education.

Reinventing Papert's Constructionism â€” Boosting Young Children's Writing Skills with e&#8209;Learning Designed for Dyslexics
Pages:
pp227&#8209;234
Authors:
Karin Tweddell Levinsen
Abstract:
Since the consent to the Salamanca Statement on special needs education from 1994, e&#8209;learning developers have focused on tools aimed to support dyslexic learners. The importance of these efforts is on display every year in the Special Aids exhibition area at the BETT&#8209;event in London. ICT and e&#8209;learning is now widely used in the special needs education for dyslexics. However, the Salamanca Statement also inspired the vision of The Spacious School and the idea that children with learning disabilities should be transferred from special classes and included in the ordinary classes in primary schools. In the beginning of this process, the children with special needs were present in the classroom with their compensational aid, e.g. e&#8209;learning, ICT and special teacher support, and they were rarely included in the socially organised learning activities. Consequently, class teachers and subject teachers were not aware of the existence and potentials of the special compensational e&#8209;learning and ICT tools. In recent years in Denmark, ICT has changed from being present in schools to becoming an available, everyday resource. That is, ICT and computers move out of the computer rooms and into every school room. I.e. most pupils use ICT, e&#8209;learning and computers in various contexts whenever it seems convenient. The increasing use of ICT in schools has paved the way for new ways of including the children with special educational needs and while knowledge of dyslexic compensational e&#8209;learning and ICT tools was earlier restricted to the special teachers, teachers in general have now become aware of the existence of these tools. Within the frame of a large scale research project in primary schools in Denmark (Project IT and Learning â€” PIL), this change of awareness led to teacher&#8209;initiated experiments with the Danish e&#8209;learning special needs&#8209;software CD Ord in first and second grades. The teachers wanted to see whether these tools could inspire normal children as well as children with special educational needs to start writing their own stories. The paper presents the research findings from the empirical studies of experiments in Second grade. The paper concludes that most children in the experiments wrote longer and more complex stories than normally expected from this age&#8209;group. The children with a visual learning style in particular demonstrated a significant progress.

A Data Warehouse Model for Micro&#8209;Level Decision Making in Higher Education
Pages:
pp235&#8209;244
Authors:
Liezl van Dyk
Abstract:
An abundance of research, by educational researchers and scholars of teaching and learning alike, can be found on the use of ICT to plan design and deliver learning activities and assessment activities. The first steps of the instructional design process are covered quite thoroughly by this. However, the use of ICT and quantitative methods to close the instructional design cycle by supporting sustainable decision making with respect to the evaluation of the effectiveness of teaching processes hold much unleashed potential. In this paper a business intelligence approach is followed in an attempt to take advantage ICT to enable the evaluation of the effectiveness of the process of facilitating learning. The focus is on micro&#8209;level decision support based on data drawn from the Learning Management System (LMS). Three quantifiable measures of online behaviour and three quantifiable measures of teaching effectiveness are identified from literature to arrive at a 3x3 matrix according to which 9 measures of e&#8209;teaching effectiveness can be derived by means of pair&#8209;wise correlation. The value and significance of information are increased within context of other information. In this paper it is shown how the value of LMS tracking data increases within context of data from other modules or others years and that useful information is created when this tracking data is correlated with measures of teaching effectives such as results, learning styles and student satisfaction. This information context can only be created when a deliberate business intelligence approach if followed. In this paper a data warehouse model is proposed to accomplish exactly this.

Technology&#8209;Assisted Reading for Improving Reading Skills for young South African Learners

Abstract:
This paper addresses the controversial issues of improving the reading skills of young learners through technology&#8209;assisted reading programmes. On reporting the results of primary school learners from grade 2 to grade 7 who participated in a computer&#8209;based reading programme for seven months, we try to answer the critical questions of whether computer&#8209;assisted reading programmes should be embraced or avoided. We also have looked at the possible benefits of such an intervention apart from the improvement of reading skills.  The poorly developed reading skills of South African learners slowly became evident over the last couple of years as teachers, parents, employers and professionals were confronted with this ongoing crisis. The Department of Education (DoE) stated that the South African youth do not read as well as their foreign counterparts and actions were put in place to address the growing problem. However, despite this acknowledgement, decision makers are still indecisive in effectively addressing the problem. Many theories exist on why children are reading impaired and who should accept responsibility for it.   Data of the findings in this paper was collected over a period of seven months and reflects the reading results of learners who followed a combination of a computer&#8209;based reading programme, visual accuracy and visual memory computer exercises as well as the application of specific paper&#8209;based activities. Groups were small, with continuous personal intervention and communication from the facilitator with each learner. This paper also qualitatively reflects on the additional benefits or negative experiences of learners who participated in the electronic reading programme. The qualitative data was accumulated from interviews with learners and teachers involved.   The efficacy of the reading programme was evaluated through continuous assessment of learners' performance on different aspects of reading, including reading speed, reading comprehension, spelling and language. The reading results obtained were compared with the initial reading assessment before implementing the programme. The overall experience of learners who participated in this programme provided valuable information in evaluating the reading programme as a whole.  Results obtained from this study indicate that improvement in reading speed, comprehension and spelling was unique to every learner individually. The benefits beyond the improvement of reading skills obtained as a result of the programme encompass many areas of the learners' development, such as social learning, collaborative learning, finer perceptual motor skills, confidence and a general improvement in marks in other subjects.  This paper attempts to provide insights into the value and challenges of computer&#8209;assisted reading for primary school learners and into the importance of adapting teaching methods in response to a crisis.

e&#8209;Learning Indicators: a Multi&#8209;Dimensional Model for Planning and Evaluating e&#8209;Learning Software Solutions
Pages:
pp1&#8209;28
Authors:
Bekim Fetaji
Majlinda Fetaji
Abstract:
As a number of recent studies suggest applications of networked computers in education have very inconsistent results ranging from success stories to complete failures. Literally, thousands of e&#8209;learning projects have been carried out that greatly differ in their outcomes. Until now, however, there is no systematic or a standardized way of planning, comparing and evaluating e&#8209;learning projects, their outcomes, and their effectiveness. Therefore, the main objective of this research was an investigation of possible approaches to systematic planning, development and evaluation of e&#8209;learning initiatives and their corresponding e&#8209;learning projects. The result of this work is a multidimensional model of e&#8209;learning Indicators that are defined as the important concepts and factors that are used to communicate information about the level of e&#8209;learning and used to make management decisions when planning e&#8209;learning strategy. The lack of knowledge of the learner audience as well as of the factors influencing that audience and e&#8209;learning projects overall results in failing to provide satisfactory support in the decision making process. In order to address this issue, an approach dealing with e&#8209;learning indicators is proposed. Having a standardised guide of e&#8209;learning indicators accepted by the scientific community enables comparison and evaluation of different initiatives regarding e&#8209;learning in a standardised manner. The proposed E&#8209;learning Indicators Methodology enables successful planning, comparison and evaluation of different e&#8209;learning projects. It represents an empirical methodology that gives concrete results expressed through numbers that could be analysed and later used to compare and conclude its e&#8209;learning efficiency. A practical value of this approach was analyzed in the realized comparative analyses of two different institutions using different LMS tools: Angel and Moodle focusing on comparison and evaluation of e&#8209;learning indicators of these two e&#8209;learning projects. With the application of this methodology in e&#8209;learning projects it is more likely to achieve better results and higher efficiency as well as higher Return on Investment&#8209;ROI.

Title:
Towards a Fusion of Formal and Informal Learning Environments: the Impact of the ReadWrite Web
Pages:
pp29&#8209;40
Authors:
Richard Hall
Abstract:
The readwrite web, or Web 2.0, offers ways for users to personalise their online existence, and to develop their own critical identities though their control of a range of tools. Exerting control enables those users to forge new contexts, profiles and content through which to represent themselves, based upon the user&#8209;centred, participative, social networking affordances of specific technologies. In turn these technologies enable learners to integrate their own contexts, profiles and content, in order to develop informal associations or communities of inquiry. Within educational contexts these tools enable spaces for learners to extend their own formal learning into more informal places though the fusion of web&#8209;based tools into a task&#8209;oriented personal learning environment. Where students are empowered to make decisions about the tools that support their personal approaches to learning, they are able develop further control over their learning experiences and move towards their own subject&#8209;based mastery. Critically, they are able to define with whom to share their personal approaches, and how they can best connect the informal learning that occurs across their life to their formal, academic work. The personal definition or fusion of tools and tasks is afforded through individual control over the learning environment. The flowering of personal learning aims, mediated by technologies and rules of engagement, occurs within task&#8209;specific loops where learners can interpret and process epistemological signals. In turn, where those loops are located within broader, personalised environments students can make contextual sense of their learning and extend their own educational opportunities. Moreover, they can extend their own academic decision&#8209;making through application in other contexts, and as a result manage their own academic uncertainties. This is evidenced through a thematic study of the voices of both learners and tutors, which highlights how the readwrite web can be used proactively by educators, using specific tasks to enable learners to fuse their informal and formal learning spaces, and thereby enhance their decision&#8209;making confidence. The structuring of learning spaces that enable users and social networks to manage their educational processes is enhanced by readwrite web approaches and tools, and in this paper is defined through a Fused Learner Integration model.

Abstract:
In 2007, a small team of university and secondary school teachers jointly developed and piloted an e&#8209;class for 4 and 5 grade students (age: 16&#8209;17yrs) at both pre&#8209;university and general vocational level. The goal was to develop and try out innovative ways of teaching mathematics that would enable schools to offer optional courses for small numbers of students. The e&#8209;class can be summarized as web&#8209;supported instruction in a blended learning approach. The instructional material consisted of the chapter on discrete dynamical models from a brand&#8209;new mathematics textbook, supplemented by investigative activities. Students could build and simulate dynamical models with the computer learning environment Coach. Instructions for learning to work with software were given through screen casts created by the teacher to gear with students' needs and made available in the Sakai&#8209;based virtual learning environment. Students got weekly on&#8209;line assignments, which they submitted digi&#8209; tally. At home they could get assistance from peers and the teacher in a chat room. We discuss some of the e&#8209; ingredients of the e&#8209;class and their potential for teaching and learning mathematics and science in terms of principled design approaches to multimedia learning and pedagogical arrangements. We report the experiences of the participants of the project and present the future plans based on this work.

Anita Lee-Post
Abstract:
This paper reports the observations made and experience gained from developing and delivering an online quantitative methods course for Business undergraduates. Inspired by issues and challenges experienced in developing the online course, a model is advanced to address the question of how to guide the design, development, and delivery of successful e&#8209;learning initiatives based on theories of a user&#8209;centered information systems development paradigm.  The benefits of using the proposed model for e&#8209;learning success assessment is demonstrated through four cycles of action research after two action research cycles of pilot study. Findings from our empirical study confirm the value of an action research methodology for promoting e&#8209;learning success. The paper concludes with a discussion on the merits of the proposed model in furthering our understanding of how to define, assess, and promote e&#8209;learning success.

Impact of Communication Patterns, Network Positions and Social Dynamics Factors on Learning among Students in a CSCL Environment
Pages:
pp64&#8209;77
Authors:
Binod Sundararajan
Abstract:
At present, it is difficult to assess the quality of learning in Computer&#8209;Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) environments, because standard pretest and posttest measures do not capture the differences in the learner's ability to engage in the material, pose interesting new questions, engage others in learning and work collaboratively. This research investigates the impact of communication patterns, network positions and social dynamics factors on students' self&#8209;perception of learning in a CSCL environment. The study involved a combination of methodologies combining questionnaires, and archiving of communication logs for data collection. Social network analysis tools were used to analyze relational data, map emergent student communication patterns and calculate centrality scores based on the electronic and face&#8209;to&#8209;face communication patterns among class members in the CSCL environment. Structural equation modeling was then performed on the hypotheses model to determine the impact of these centrality measures and the social factors on students' perceptions of knowledge gained and their satisfaction with their performance in the course.

Mobile City and Language Guides â€” New Links Between Formal and Informal Learning Environments

Abstract:
One of the major challenges in second and foreign language education, is to create links between formal and informal learning environments. Mobile City and Language Guides present examples of theoretical and practical reflections on such links. This paper presents and discusses the first considerations of Mobile City and Language Guides in language centres, upper secondary schools and universities. The core concept of Mobile City and Language Guides is geotagging. Geographical locations can be geotagged either through GPS or by marking positions directly in, e.g., Google Earth or Google Maps. Students or teachers can add various kinds of information to geotags: Photos, audio, text, movies, links, vocabulary and various language tasks. This allows the student, in self&#8209;defined learning contexts, to down&#8209; and upload location&#8209;based materials with his or her mobile phone, for immediate or later processing. More and more students are able to afford mobile phones with multimedia and broadband Internet. The potentials of user&#8209;generated mobile&#8209; and web&#8209;based content are increasing. In these years, the internet is moving from the so&#8209;called Web 1.0 to the more user&#8209;centered Web 2.0, i.e. Weblogs, YouTube, Google Maps, MySpace, FlickR, etc. In an educational context, Web 2.0 represents an interesting development of the relatively monologue Web 1.0, where traditional homepages often only allow minimal interaction with the site content. This paper investigates the opportunities that Mobile City and Language Guides seem to give second and foreign language students to learn from informal, location&#8209;based, experience&#8209;based and authentic materials; and discusses how language centres, upper secondary education and universities can involve informal learning contexts through student use of mobiles with broadband and Internet technology supporting second and foreign learning. Mobile City and Language Guides is only of several possible mobile and Internet&#8209;based language educational scenarios. The challenge for the future, therefore, is to develop and implement new, meaningful and exciting scenarios that strengthen the linkages between formal and informal learning environments.

Some Factors to Consider When Designing Semi&#8209;Autonomous Learning Environments
Pages:
pp93&#8209;100
Authors:
Paul Bouchard
Abstract:
This research aims to answer the question, "in what ways do mediated learning environments support or hinder learner autonomy?"  Learner autonomy has been identified as one important factor in the success of mediated learning environments. The central aspect of learner autonomy is the control that the learner exercises over the various aspects of learning, beginning with the decision to learn or not to learn. But as Candy (1995) points out, there are several areas where learner&#8209;control can be exercised.   The first are the motivational&#8209;intentional forces that drive the learner to apply some determination (or "vigour") to the act of learning. They are the conative functions of learning and include learner intiative, motivation and personal involvement. They are often associated with life goals that are independent of the actual learning goals pursued within the strict confines of the learning environment (Long, 1994).   The second area of learner&#8209;control is the one comprising the "nuts&#8209;and&#8209;bolts" of the act of learning, such as defining learning goals, deciding on a learning sequence, choosing a workable pacing of learning activities, and selecting learning resources (Hrimech & Bouchard, 1998). These are the algorithmic aspects of learning, and in traditional schooling, they are the sole responsibility of the teacher. In mediated learning environments, it can be shared between the platform and the actual learner.   Just a few years ago, learner control was necessarily limited to these two sets of features, conative and algorithmic. Today however, with the proliferation of educational offerings in both the private and public sector, as well as the developments in educational technology, two other aspects of the learning environment emerge as important areas where learner&#8209;control can be exercised.   The semiotic dimension of learner&#8209;control includes the symbolic platforms used to convey information and meaning, for example web "pages", hypertext, videoaudio multimedia, animation, each of these bringing with them their own specific set of possibilities and limitations for autonomy in learning.  And then again, all learning environments exist in their own distinct economic sphere where decisions about whether, what and how to learn are made on the basis of cost&#8209;benefit, opportunity cost, and extrinsic market value.  We will examine the implications of each of these areas of learner&#8209;control, and share our analysis of a series of interviews with cyber&#8209;learners, based on this framework of conative, algorithmic, semiotic and economic factors.

Game Inspired Tool Support for e&#8209;Learning Processes

Abstract:
Student engagement is crucial to the success of e&#8209;learning but is often difficult to achieve in practice. One significant factor is the quality of the learning content; also important, however, is the suitability of the process through which that material is studied. In recent years much research has been devoted to improving e&#8209; learning content but considerably less attention given to enhancing the associated e&#8209;learning process. This paper focuses on that process, considering in particular how student engagement might be improved using techniques common in digital games. The work is motivated by a belief that, with careful design, e&#8209;learning systems may be able to achieve the levels of engagement expected of digital games. In general, such games succeed by entertaining players, building on their natural curiosity and competitiveness to encourage them to continue to play. This paper supports a belief that by adopting some of the engagement techniques used in games, e&#8209; learning can become equally successful. In particular, the paper considers how the learning process might become a form of game that helps sustain continued study. Factors affecting engagement and elements of digital games that make them engaging are identified. A proposal for improving engagement is then outlined. The approach is to encourage student involvement by rewarding desirable behaviour, including the completion of optional challenges, and giving regular feedback on performance, measured against others in the same class. Feedback is provided through a web&#8209;based tool. The paper describes an exploratory assessment of both the tool and approach through action research. Results for two linked university modules teaching software development are presented. The results so far are very encouraging in that student engagement and performance have increased, especially at the weaker end of the class. Limitations of the approach are also outlined, together with an indication of future research plans.

Title:
Web 2.0&#8209;Mediated Competence â€” Implicit Educational Demands on Learners
Pages:
pp111&#8209;118
Authors:
Nina Bonderup Dohn
Abstract:
The employment of Web 2.0 within higher educational settings has become increasingly popular. Reasons for doing so include student motivation, didactic considerations of facilitating individual and collaborative knowledge construction, and the support Web 2.0 gives the learner in transgressing and resituating content and practices between the formal and informal learning settings in which she participates. However, introducing Web 2.0&#8209;practices into educational settings leads to tensions and challenges in practice because of conceptual tensions between the views of knowledge and learning inherent in Web 2.0&#8209;practices and in the educational system: Implicit in Web 2.0&#8209;practices is a conception of 'knowledge' as, on the one side, process and activity, i.e. as use, evaluation, transformation and reuse of material, and, on the other, the product side, as a distributed attribute of a whole system (such as Wikipedia) or community of practice (such as the community of practice of Wikipedia contributors). In contrast, 'knowledge' within the educational system is traditionally viewed as a state possessed by the individual, and learning as the acquisition of this state. This paper is an analysis of the challenges which these tensions lead to for the learners. The argument is that Web 2.0&#8209;mediated learning activities within an educational setting place implicit competence demands on the students, along with the more explicit ones of reflexivity, participation and knowledge construction. These demands are to some extent in conflict with each other as well as with the more explicit ones. A simple example of such conflicting competence demands is experienced when students develop a course wiki: The Web 2.0&#8209;competence demands here concern the doing something with the material. The copy&#8209;pasting of e.g. a Wikipedia&#8209;article without referencing it from this point of view is a legitimate contribution to the knowledge building of the course wiki. In contrast, educational competence demands require the student to participate actively in the formulation of the course wiki&#8209;articles. Copy&#8209;pasting without reference from this point of view is cheating. Here, the student is met with the incoherent requirement of authoring entries that display the acquisition of a knowledge state in a context where authorship is renounced and knowledge is understood dynamically and distributively. More generally, in Web 2.0&#8209;mediated educational learning activities, the student is required to manoeuvre in a field of interacting, yet conflicting, demands, and the assessment of hisher competence stands the risk of being more of an evaluation of the skill to so manoeuvre than of skills and knowledge explicitly pursued in the course.

Listening to the Learners' Voices in HE: how do Students Reflect on their use of Technology for Learning?

pp119&#8209;126
Authors:

Abstract:
The importance of the Learner's Voice and thus of listening to students' views has been evidenced in various high profile initiatives in the UK. The work presented here is from the JISC Learners' Experiences of E&#8209; Learning Phase 2 Learners' Journeys STROLL project. The seven JISC funded projects were set up in 2007 to investigate inter alia the changing views of students in their use of technology to support their learning. The STROLL (STudent Reflections on Lifelong e&#8209;Learning) project has recruited a diverse range of students from both Higher and Further Education backgrounds with the aim of researching the students' experiences of learning in a technology rich environment and their progression in their use of learning technologies over the two years of the project's timescale. STROLL is a largely qualitative study with students participating from across the University of Hertfordshire (UH) and Hertford Regional College (HRC) by recording their own video and audio diaries of their learning experiences. Using the students' choice of camcorder, web camera, or digital voice recorder they recorded their daily learning experiences of using technology, including a range of e&#8209;learning tools and the University's own MLE (Study Net). The project started in March 2007 and completed in March 2009 with the final round of student diaries collected in October 2008.   The project's aim was to research and document the students' answers to the following questions:  How do learners experience change through their learning journey?  How do students use and make choices about their time?  How do students use e&#8209;learning tools to support their learning?  How do students use their personal technologies?  The qualitative data from the students' reflective diaries collected was first transcribed, then the transcripts were analysed and colour coded according to the research themes. Concept maps were created for each student's diary detailing their reflections on learning. Further concept maps of quotations relating to the research questions above were developed to identify comments which were particularly relevant to the themes. Finally NvivoÂ’ was used to support and track the large quantities of data. This paper presents some of the early findings in terms of the ease with which students interact with technology and the choices they make about what they use and when and where. The discussion includes consideration of the research methodologies, since the use of personal video diaries to record reflections on learning, is to date a rarely used method of capturing data on students' reflections.

Title:
Learning Objects and Virtual Learning Environments Technical Evaluation Criteria

pp127&#8209;136

Valentina Dagiene
Abstract:
The main scientific problems investigated in this article deal with technical evaluation of quality attributes of the main components of e&#8209;Learning systems (referred here as DLEs â€” Digital Libraries of Educational Resources and Services), i.e., Learning Objects (LOs) and Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs). The main research object of the work is the effectiveness of methods of DLE components quality evaluation. The aim of the article is to analyse popular existing LO and VLE technical evaluation tools, and to formulate new more complex tools for technical quality evaluation of LOs and VLEs based on requirements for flexible DLE, as well as to evaluate most popular open source VLEs against new more complex criteria. Complex tools have been created for the evaluation of DLE components, based on a flexible approach. The authors have analysed existing tools for technical evaluation of LOs, and it was investigated that these tools have a number of limitations. Some of these tools do not examine different LO life cycle stages, and other insufficiently examine technical evaluation criteria before LO inclusion in the repository. All these tools insufficiently examine LOs reusability criteria. Therefore more complex LO technical evaluation tool is needed. It was investigated that this new more complex LO technical evaluation tool should include LO technical evaluation criteria suitable for different LO life cycle stages, including criteria before, during and after LO inclusion in the repository as well as LO reusability criteria. The authors have also examined several VLE technical evaluation tools suitable for flexible DLE, and it was investigated that these tools have a number of limitations. Several tools practically do not examine VLE adaptation capabilities criteria, and the other insufficiently examines general technical criteria. More complex VLE technical evaluation tool is needed. Therefore the authors have proposed an original more complex set of VLE technical evaluation criteria combining (1) General (Overall architecture and implementation; Interoperability; Internationalisation and Localisation; Accessibility) and (2) Adaptation (Adaptability; Personalisation; Extensibility and Adaptivity) VLE technical evaluation criteria. The authors have also selected and proposed to use the universal, clear and convenient DLE components' evaluation rating tool, and have evaluated three most popular open source VLEs against technical (both general and adaptation) criteria in conformity with this rating tool.

The Enhancement of Reusability of Course Content and Scenarios in Unified e&#8209;Learning Environment for Schools

Authors:

Abstract:
With the expansion of e&#8209;learning, the understanding and evaluation of already created e&#8209;learning environments is becoming an extremely important issue. One way to dealing with the problem is analysis of case studies, i.e. already created environments, from the reuse perspective. The paper presents a general framework and model to assess UNITE, the unified e&#8209;learning environment for schools, from the reuse perspective. UNITE is the e&#8209;learning environment of the ongoing EU project (FP6 IST&#8209;26964, 2006&#8209;2008, http:www.unite&#8209;ist.org). UNITE assets are described using feature diagrams (FDs) telling us about the internal structure of UNITE; representing relationships among the compound and atomic features, thus enhancing better transparency of UNITE and in this way empowering reuse. The factors of UNITE influential to reuse with some concrete results are also presented. We provide analysis aiming to extract from the model the relevant information of two kinds: (1) which is influential to reuse in a positive sense, i.e., enhancing reuse (e.g., application of meta&#8209;design methodology for the scenarios description, classification of subjects in metadata, use of content management tools (e.g., Course editor, Metadata editor), multi&#8209;linguistic approach, international and local collaboration between teachers and students in e&#8209;learning scenario implementation and delivery, and methodological support, etc.) and (2) which is hindering reuse (e. g., age of the students, differences in national syllabus and national educational programmes, language, cultural and communication problems). Despite of some limitations of FDs, we found this notation useful because it allows the explicit representation of various aspects of the complex system (i.e., UNITE) focusing on variability of features and possible relationships and constraints. We focus on the aspects such as evaluation of the UNITE platform including tools, scenarios and content variability.

Strategies for Embedding e&#8209;Learning in Traditional Universities: Drivers and Barriers

pp147&#8209;154
Authors:
Kay MacKeogh
Seamus Fox
Abstract:
This paper addresses the question: how can e&#8209;learning be embedded in traditional universities so that it contributes to the transformation of the university? The paper examines e&#8209;learning strategies in higher education, locating the institutional context within the broader framework of national and international policy drivers which link e&#8209;learning with the achievement of strategic goals such as widening access to lifelong learning, and upskilling for the knowledge and information society. The focus will be on traditional universities i.e. universities whose main form of teaching is on&#8209;campus and face&#8209;to&#8209;face, rather than on open and distance teaching universities, which face different strategic issues in implementing e&#8209;learning. Reports on the adoption of e&#8209;learning in traditional universities indicate extensive use of e&#8209;learning to improve the quality of learning for on&#8209; campus students, but this has not yet translated into a significant increase in opportunities for lifelong learners in the workforce and those unable to attend on&#8209;campus. One vision of the future of universities is that 'Virtualisation and remote working technologies will enable us to study at any university in the world, from home . However, this paper will point out that realisation of this vision of ubiquitous and lifelong access to higher education requires that a fully articulated e&#8209;learning strategy aims to have a 'transformative' rather than just a 'sustaining' effect on teaching functions carried out in traditional universities. In order words, rather than just facilitating universities to improve their teaching, e&#8209;learning should transform how universities currently teach. However, to achieve this transformation, universities will have to introduce strategies and policies which implement flexible academic frameworks, innovative pedagogical approaches, new forms of assessments, cross&#8209;institutional accreditation and credit transfer agreements, institutional collaboration in development and delivery, and, most crucially, commitment to equivalence of access for students on and off&#8209;campus. The insights in this paper are drawn from an action research case study involving both qualitative and quantitative approaches, utilising interviews, surveys and focus groups with stakeholders, in addition to comparative research on international best practice. The paper will review the drivers and rationales at international, national and institutional level which are leading to the development of e&#8209;learning strategies, before outlining the outcomes of a case study of e&#8209;learning strategy development in a traditional Irish university. This study examined the drivers and barriers which increase or decrease motivation to engage in e&#8209;learning, and provides some insights into the challenges of embedding e&#8209; learning in higher education. While recognising the desirability of reaching out to new students and engaging in innovative pedagogical approaches, many academic staff continue to prefer traditional lectures, and are sceptical about the potential for student learning in online settings. Extrinsic factors in terms of lack of time and support serve to decrease motivation and there are also fears of loss of academic control to central administration. The paper concludes with some observations on how university e&#8209;learning strategies must address staff concerns through capacity building, awareness raising and the establishment of effective support structures for embedding e&#8209;learning.

Abstract:
This paper explores a number of key issues that have been identified as being important in the identification and evaluation of best practice within the context of e&#8209;learning and virtual campuses. The 'Promoting Best Practice in Virtual Campuses' (PBP&#8209;VC) project is a two year European Commission Education Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) co&#8209;financed project that is aimed at providing a deeper understanding of the key issues and success factors underlying the implementation and sustainability of virtual campuses. The PBP&#8209;VC project team have been working with stakeholders from a number of large virtual campus projects across Europe in identifying and exploring key issues relating to best practice and sustainability. The importance of developing a practical framework for identifying, evaluating and promoting best practice in virtual campuses and e&#8209;learning can be demonstrated by the significant number of high profile e&#8209;learning and virtual campus failures both within Europe and globally. In many cases their failure has been quite spectacular with millions of dollars being wasted as a result some quite basic errors in overlooking key best practice issues that have occurred across several large&#8209;scale projects. This paper will provide a description of the different issues relating to models for best practice and sustainability that has been developed by the PBP&#8209;VC project.

Abstract:
This paper describes the findings about the use of Web 2.0 technologies in the education of health professionals in the United Kingdom (UK). The work is part of a wider study scoping the use of e&#8209;learning. Its objectives were to: Explore issues influencing implementation and use by both early and late adopters; Identify barriers to implementation and good practice; Review the employment of e&#8209;learning within curricula representing a range of teaching models. In phase one, a postal survey obtained data from 25 higher education institutions relating to their uptake and development in this field. A second phase identified four case studies, two from early and two late adopters, reflecting the features identified from phase one. In the case studies, interviews and focus groups with students and staff were conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the issues which were significant to them. The main findings suggested e&#8209;learning development and use varies, with a spectrum of employment across the sector. The predominant engagement is with instructivist learning approaches managed through a Virtual Learning Environment with only limited experimentation in interactive learning online. This paper will discuss the findings from the study where they relate to the limited use of Web 2.0 technologies. It will include a discussion on the moral, legal and ethical implications of current and future developments.

How Reproducible Research Leads to Non&#8209;Rote Learning Within Socially Constructivist Statistics Education
Pages:
pp173&#8209;182
Authors:
Patrick Wessa
Abstract:
This paper discusses the implementation of a new e&#8209;learning environment that supports non&#8209;rote learning of exploratory and inductive statistics within the pedagogical paradigm of social constructivism. The e&#8209; learning system is based on a new computational framework that allows us to create an electronic research environment where students are empowered to interact with reproducible computations from peers and the educator. The underlying technology effectively supports social interaction (communication), knowledge construction, collaboration, and scientific experimentation even if the student population is very large. In addition, the system allows us to measure important aspects of the actual learning process which are otherwise unobservable. With this new information it is possible to explore (and investigate) the effectiveness of e&#8209;based learning, the impact of software usability, and the importance of knowledge construction through various feedback and communication mechanisms. Based on a preliminary empirical analysis from two courses (with large student populations) it is shown that there are strong relationships between actual constructivist learning activities and scores on objective examinations, in which the questions assess conceptual understanding. It is also explained that non&#8209;rote learning is supported by the fact that the system allows users to reproduce results and reuse them in derived research that can be easily communicated.

The Implications of SCORM Conformance for Workplace e&#8209;Learning
Pages:
pp183&#8209;190
Authors:
Gabrielle Witthaus
Abstract:
This paper explores the impact that SCORM conformance has had on workplace e&#8209;learning. The author describes a project in which she was requested to "repurpose" some materials that had originally been designed for the face&#8209;to&#8209;face teaching of English as a Foreign Language, into SCORM conformant e&#8209;learning materials. The rationale for this request was that the training centre management wanted to track learners' progress via a Learning Management System (LMS). However, in order to integrate SCORM&#8209;conformant tracking functionality into the programmes, the learning materials would have to have been stripped of all the collaborative, productive and communicative aspects of their pedagogy. The learning designers and training centre management had to engage in a steep learning curve to find an alternative solution that was both pedagogically sound and administratively efficient. This anecdote highlights some of the challenges facing the corporate sector in terms of the management of e&#8209;learning content. To put the issues into context, the paper gives an overview of SCORM, and defines some related terminology â€” Sharable Content Objects (SCOs), LMS and Learning Content Management System (LCMS). SCORM conformance has two main aims: the ability to deliver content on any Learning Management System, and the ability to track learners' actions and scores when they use the materials. It is argued that, while the higher education sector has chosen to emphasise the first aim, focusing more on the development of stimulating learning content that can be shared across disciplines and across institutions, the corporate sector has emphasised the second aim, focusing more on tracking learners' progress through learning programmes. It is suggested that this is one of the explanations for the continued proliferation of relatively rigid, behaviourist style teaching materials for workplace e&#8209;learning. This instructivist style pedagogical model is considered in relation to the military and programming origins of SCORM, and a number of more innovative approaches to workplace e&#8209;learning from the recent literature are discussed. The paper concludes by arguing that, for corporate e&#8209;learning programmes to be successful, all stakeholders need to be included in the strategic decisions, and all stakeholders need to engage in a learning process to understand each others' points of view and explore the available options and their consequences. This study will be of value to anyone who needs to develop SCORM conformant courses, as well as managers who are charged with overseeing such projects, or developing an organisational training strategy involving an LMSLCMS.

Investigating a Nigerian XXL&#8209;Cohort Wiki&#8209;Learning Experience: Observation, Feedback and Reflection
Pages:
pp191&#8209;202
Authors:
Peter Aborisade
Abstract:
A regular feature of the Nigerian tertiary education context is large numbers of students crammed into small classrooms or lecture theatres. This context had long begged for the creation of innovative learning spaces and adoption of engaging pedagogies. Recourse to technology support and experimenting with the WIKI as a learning tool at the Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA), Nigeria gave us an insight into the benefits and challenges of the set&#8209;up and use of new knowledge technologies in our technology&#8209;poor context. This paper reports an experiment in an extra&#8209;large (XXL) class of freshmen (2000+) on a module of second language project writing using the WIKI. The paper emphasises the unique advantages of the WIKI in a large blended learning class and the affordances for socio&#8209;cultural and collaborative learning experience. In creating new learning teams and forging collaboration among learners leveraging one another's abilities, the wiki experience extended the 'classroom' beyond the physical space, engaged students in interactional communication in the second language, encouraged negotiation of meaning, and challenged learners in finding their 'solutions' to real life problems around them, aside from acquisition of hands&#8209;on digital literacy. The paper reports on how learners experienced and participated in learning on a technology supported module. Data for the investigation and evaluation of students' learning experiences were collected using teacher observation of team formation and collaboration on activities offline and tracked students' logs, footprints and activities on group pages online; students' feedback on the end&#8209;of&#8209;course learners' evaluation forms; and their reflections as gleaned from their comments, encouraged and freely made continually by many from inception through to the end of the course, on the front page of our wiki. The report employs both qualitative and quantitative parameters. Results indicated a large number of students felt satisfied that the learning experience, though difficult, was worth their while; it opened up new vistas to the world; it got them working and learning to collaborate in groups; they developed a level of autonomy they would like to keep, and would like more of their courses supported by technology and thought the medium offered hope for the future, as it opened up new vistas in their learning.

Weblogs in Higher Education â€” why do Students (not) Blog?

Abstract:
Positive impacts on learning through blogging, such as active knowledge construction and reflective writing, have been reported. However, not many students use weblogs in informal contexts, even when appropriate facilities are offered by their universities. While motivations for blogging have been subject to empirical studies, little research has addressed the issue of why students choose not to blog. This paper presents an empirical study undertaken to gain insights into the decision making process of students when deciding whether to keep a blog or not. A better understanding of students' motivations for (not) blogging may help decision makers at universities in the process of selecting, introducing, and maintaining similar services. As informal learning gains increased recognition, results of this study can help to advance appropriate designs of informal learning contexts in Higher Education. The method of ethnographic decision tree modelling was applied in an empirical study conducted at the Vienna University of Technology, Austria. Since 2004, the university has been offering free weblog accounts for all students and staff members upon entering school, not bound to any course or exam. Qualitative, open interviews were held with 3 active bloggers, 3 former bloggers, and 3 non&#8209; bloggers to elicit their decision criteria. Decision tree models were developed out of the interviews. It turned out that the modelling worked best when splitting the decision process into two parts: one model representing decisions on whether to start a weblog at all, and a second model representing criteria on whether to continue with a weblog once it was set up. The models were tested for their validity through questionnaires developed out of the decision tree models. 30 questionnaires have been distributed to bloggers, former bloggers and non&#8209; bloggers. Results show that the main reasons for students not to keep a weblog include a preference for direct (online) communication, and concerns about the loss of privacy through blogging. Furthermore, the results indicate that intrinsic motivation factors keep students blogging, whereas stopping a weblog is mostly attributable to external factors.

GEARS a 3D Virtual Learning Environment and Virtual Social and Educational World Used in Online Secondary Schools
Pages:
pp215&#8209;224
Authors:

Abstract:
Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) are becoming increasingly popular in online education environments and have multiple pedagogical advantages over more traditional approaches to education. VLEs include 3D worlds where students can engage in simulated learning activities such as Second Life. According to Claudia L'Amoreaux at Linden Lab, "at least 300 universities around the world teach courses and conduct research in Second Life." However, to date, VLEs have been very limited in use for K&#8209;12 education. One option for secondary schools was developed by Game Environment Applying Real Skills (GEARS) and can be used in online or traditional schools. The 3D VLE is named ARC: The Impending Gale. This program has been used successfully for over a year as part of the Lincoln Interactive online curriculum. ARC allows students to create their own custom avatar and enter the educational environment. The actual content of the game differs depending on the subject the student is taking. Current courses include earth science, geography, pre&#8209;algebra, and spanish. The 3D VLE experience is designed to serve as a reinforcement of the concepts learned in the traditional lessons. The game environment itself has been very well received by students primarily because many of the continued development features were derived from student suggestions. One unique feature that was most requested was the inclusion of voice chat. Voice chat was only added as part of the ARC headquarters where students were able to meet before going out into the game world for their own specific content. The students are also highly motivated to progress through the content. ARC has been a great success for Lincoln Interactive and its parent company the National Network of Digital Schools. The social aspect of ARC was limited, and the ARC Headquarters prompted a plan to create a 3D Virtual Social and Educational World (VSEW) for the 15,000 students that had access to the Lincoln Interactive curriculum in 2009. With the inclusion of a social component, the concept of an online community was evaluated. Garrison's et al. (2000) Community of Inquiry framework is used to explore the Lincoln Interactive Community. The VSEW contains a 3D social space with custom avatars, chat, Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) communication, social objects in the form of community musical instruments, and a tutor zone for teachers. In 2009 four educational games are included in the VSEW. These educational games focus on basic concepts in the three disciplines of math, social studies, and language arts. Garrison et al, (2000) Social Presence, Cognitive Presence, and Teaching Presence are each explained in regards to the VSEW. Both ARC and the VSEW are implemented, and as of November 2009 they are currently being used by students. While there is still much to learn and explore in regards to 3D VLEs and Social Worlds, practical application by GEARS in an online secondary school has been positively accepted by faculty and students.

Moving From Analogue to High Definition e&#8209;Tools to Support Empowering Social Learning Approaches

Abstract:
Traditional educational and training settings have dictated that the act of learning is an activity that is motivated by learners, directed by a teacher expert and based on information transfer and data manipulation. In this scenario, it has been assumed that learners more or less acquire knowledge or develop sets of skills as a result of such activity. With this model in place, learning ends when the training activities cease â€” and implies that repeated doses of similar training are required over time. Various computer technologies, as they have been generally integrated into educational settings, have taken on the role as tools to support such a model. In some cases they are used to replace the teacher in these contexts although not without serious implications for learners and their learning it has been argued. During the last three decades, a growing movement in educational research, based on the theoretical support of Leon Vygtosky and Mikhail Bakhtin, is advocating that the traditional conceptualization of the learning process is misconceived. From the perspective of this movement, learning is understood as a life&#8209;long, social act of constructing knowledge in a dialogic activity with others. Within this model, social interaction is the precursor to higher order thinking rather than the reverse. The challenging question emerging for many educators is how new technologies can support knowledge and skill building in social constructivist&#8209;based learning settings. And a corollary to this question arises: Depending on the particular technology chosen, what are the implications for learning and identity construction? In this paper, we describe the Language Learning Through Conferencing project (LLTC) in which an affordable video&#8209;based web conferencing technology and desktop computers were used to conduct language learning sessions via the Internet. The project description, project content, and the experiences that took place over a sustained period, as well as the potential future for this approach to distance learning in a variety of fields are presented. The aim of the Language Learning Through Conferencing project (LLTC) has been to exploit a particular Web 2.0 technology to connect language learners internationally between Canada and new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe and more recently in the public sector in Canada. More specifically, the project was a means to respond to learners who faced challenges in finding opportunities for language learning both in Europe and in Canada. Outcomes from ongoing qualitative and quantitative findings gathered by the respective authors are indicating that these dialogic opportunities are also having a powerful influence on learners' professional, linguistic and personal identities as well as their views of technology and learning.

Abstract:
Background: Every physician in Ontario needs to know how to fill out a Form 1 in order to legally hold a person against their will for a psychiatric assessment. These forms are frequently inaccurately filled out, which could constitute wrongful confinement and, in extreme circumstances, could lead to fines as large as $25,000. Training people to fill out a Form 1 accurately is a large task, and e&#8209;learning (Internet&#8209;based training) provides a potentially efficient model for health human resources training on the Form 1. Objective: In this study, we looked at the efficacy of an e&#8209;learning module on the Form 1 by comparing baseline knowledge and skills with posttest performance. Methods: 7 medical students and 15 resident physicians were recruited for this study from within an academic health sciences setting in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada (McMaster University). The intervention took place over 1 hour in an educational computing lab and included a pretest (with tests of factual knowledge, clinical reasoning, and demonstration of skill filling out a Form 1), the e&#8209;learning module intervention, and a posttest. The primary outcome was the change between pre&#8209; and posttest performance. A scoring system for grading the accuracy of the Form 1 was developed and two blinded raters marked forms independently. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two sequences of assessments (A then B vs B then A), with a balanced design determining which test the participants received as either the pretest or posttest. Inter&#8209;rater reliability was determined using the Intraclass Correlation. Repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted. Results: The Intraclass Correlation (ICC) as the measure for inter&#8209;rater reliability was 0.98. For all outcome measures of knowledge, clinical reasoning, and skill at filling out the Form 1 there was a statistically significant improvement between pretest and posttest performance (knowledge, F(1,21) 54.5, p

Abstract:
Audio or video podcasts can be a useful tool to supplement practical exercises such as business simulations. In this paper, we discuss a case study in which different types of podcast were utilised to support the delivery of a course in international business. The students work in groups and run a fictional company using business simulation software, which gives them the opportunity to evaluate their decision making skills. A number of podcasts were used as reusable learning objects for different student cohorts. Faculty members produced visually enhanced audio podcasts offering tutor discussions of key elements of the computer&#8209;assisted business simulation used by the students. The podcasts were made available via the virtual learning environment (Blackboard Vista), as well as for subscription by web browser&#8209;based RSS readers, such as Google and downloadable RSS readers, such as iTunes. Our evaluation of this approach to using podcasts takes into account pedagogic and technical issues. Firstly, faculty members involved in this case study were interviewed to obtain their views and experiences on the process of producing podcasts as well as the suitability of podcasts to support their teaching. Secondly, students were surveyed and interviewed about the value of the podcasts and the way in which they were used. This work is on&#8209;going and initial informal student feedback indicates that the podcasts engaged the students and supported their understanding of the international business module. This paper presents a snapshot of the current findings which generally support the value of this innovative way of using podcasting for learning and teaching.

e&#8209;Modeling â€” Helping Learners to Develop Sound e&#8209;Learning Behaviours
Pages:
pp265&#8209;272
Authors:
Susan Greener
Abstract:
The learning and teaching relationship, whether online or in the classroom, is changing. Mentis (2008) offers a typology of teacher roles gathered from current literature on e&#8209;learning including instructor, designer, guide, mediator, curator and mentor, which offer the university teacher a striking range of ways in which to develop relationships with students in the mutual development of knowledge and understanding. A study of Higher Education teachers in the UK proposed a shift in their role and behaviour concomitant with the explosion of VLE usage in universities (Greener 2008). As online and blended learning become familiar features in the university landscape, pedagogical discussions are being given more priority and ideas about how students can be enabled to learn appropriate skills for employability and lifelong learning, as well as higher order thinking, claim attention. Online, the teacher's status can easily be eroded, as learners can compare teacher&#8209;designed resources with video lectures from across the world on similar topics and chat directly with experts in the field through their blogs. Teachers who are open to new ways of thinking about their subject, and welcome such self&#8209; directed behaviour from learners, are most likely to integrate new technology into their teaching (Baylor and Ritchie 2002), and their own competence with technology will be a factor in how such integration works. But it is vital in these discussions not to lose sight of classroom behaviour in the rush to develop e&#8209;moderating and blogging skills for teachers. What teachers say and do in their face&#8209;to&#8209;face classes has always had a major impact on not only what is learned but also how it is learned. Bandura suggests that most human learning is done by observing and imitating others' behaviour (1977) provided the potential learner attends, can retain, reproduce and wants to do these things. So if we aim to integrate at least the affordances of VLEs into teaching design for blended learning, one of our considerations must be how the teacher uses the VLE in front of the learner. There is no doubt that teachers are increasingly uploading materials and weblinks etc into VLEs to support learners (or are made to by institutional policy). However there is less evidence that teachers are role&#8209;modelling effective e&#8209; learning to their learners. Some of this is about competence, but it is rare for a teacher to lack the ability to learn basic technology use. More of this reluctance is about fear and anxiety, to be shown up as incompetent in class to what are considered the net generation. This paper will explore the concepts and behaviours implied in the role&#8209;modelling of effective e&#8209;learning in the classroom, drawing on data from teachers and learners involved in using VLEs and other Web resources in face&#8209;to&#8209;face sessions.

Title:
Measuring the Effectiveness of Educational Technology: what are we Attempting to Measure?
Pages:
pp273&#8209;280
Authors:
Jodie Jenkinson
Abstract:
In many academic areas, students' success depends upon their ability to envision and manipulate complex multidimensional information spaces. Fields in which students struggle with mastering these types of representations include (but are by no means limited to) mathematics, science, medicine, and engineering. There has been some educational research examining the impact of incorporating multiple media modalities into curriculum specific to these disciplines. For example, both Richard Mayer (multimedia learning) and John Sweller (cognitive load) have contributed greatly to establishing theories describing the basic mechanisms of learning in a multimedia environment. However when we attempt to apply these theories to the evaluation of e&#8209; learning in a more dynamic "real world" context the information processing model that forms the basis of this research fails to capture the complex interactions that occur between the learner and the knowledge object. It is not surprising that studies examining the effectiveness of e&#8209;learning technology, particularly in the area of basic science, have reported mixed results. In part this may be due to the quality of the stimuli being assessed. This may also be explained by the context in which interactivity is being utilized and the model that is used to evaluate its effectiveness. Educational researchers have begun to identify a need for more fine&#8209;grained research studies that capture the subtleties of learners' interactions with dynamic and interactive learning objects. In undergraduate medical and life science education, interactive technology has been integrated into the curriculum at many levels. This paper reviews experimental studies drawn from personal experience where an attempt has been made to measure the efficacy of educational technology. In examining the shortcomings of these more traditional experiments, we can then apply this understanding to characterizing a more flexible approach to evaluation and its potential in measuring the effectiveness of educational technology. Understanding the nature of technology&#8209;mediated learning interactions and the way in which they foster depth of understanding is a great challenge for both educational researchers and developers of e&#8209;learning technologies. By adopting an evaluative framework that takes a more flexible approach to measuring the emergent nature of understanding, we can examine the capacity of educational technology to support more complex understanding of curricular subject matter.

Abstract:
At the University of Toronto at Scarborough, we provide enhanced flexibility to our students using a blended learning approach (i.e., the webOption) whereby classes are videotaped as they are offered in a traditional manner, then posted online for subsequent student access. Students can attend lectures live, watch them online at their convenience, or both. Previous research examining the webOption in the context of Introductory Psychology revealed that (a) students were satisfied with the webOption in general, (b) students used and appreciated the pause and seek features afforded by the webOption interface, and (c) those who used the pause and seek features performed slightly better on exams (Bassili & Joordens, 2008). The current research examines similar issues in the context of two mathematics courses. These courses differ from the lecture&#8209;based Introductory Psychology class in their emphasis on the teaching of mathematical proofs; cognitive skills that, like any other skill, are enhanced with practice (Schneider & Shiffrin, 1977). Access to online lectures allows students to re&#8209;experience the professor as they teach these skills. Given this, the webOption might be especially potent in these learning contexts. Surprisingly, the results we report here do not confirm that prediction. Students do use and appreciate the features of the webOption as was the case in our previous work, but those students who augmented their class attendance with online viewing, and those who used the lecture&#8209; control features the most, were actually the students who performed most poorly. Said another way, those students who had the most trouble with the course did indeed use the webOption as a way of understanding the material better but, interestingly, doing so did not result in better performance. Several possible reasons for this surprising result are considered.

When Knowing More Means Knowing Less: Understanding the Impact of Computer Experience on e&#8209;Learning and e&#8209;Learning Outcomes

Abstract:
Students often report feeling more overloaded in courses that use e&#8209;learning environments compared to traditional face&#8209;to&#8209;face courses that do not use such environments. Discussions here consider online design and organizational factors that might contribute to students' reports of information overload. It was predicted that certain online factors might contribute to stimulus overload and possibly students' perceived overload, rather than information overload per se. User characteristics and a range of design and organizational factors that might contribute to perceived overload are discussed and hypotheses of how such factors might affect learning outcomes are also discussed. An experiment was conducted to test predictions that (i) students' past online experience, (ii) the organization and relevance of online information, and (iii) the level of task difficulty affect (i) learning outcomes, (ii) students' perceptions of information overload, and (iii) students' perceptions of having enough time to complete experimental tasks. A total of 187 participants were tested in four experimental conditions that manipulated the organization and relevance of online material that students had to learn (ie, (i) a stimulus&#8209;low environment, where the material to be learned was presented as scrolling text, with no other stimuli present; (ii) a familiar environment, where the material to be learned was set within the borders of a familiar course Web site; (iii) a stimulus&#8209;rich or stimulus&#8209; noisy environment, where the material to be learned was set within the borders of an Amazon.com Web page (a Web site where you can search for, and buy books, videos and other products online); (iv) a PDF file environment, where the material to be learned was presented as a PDF file that resembled an online duplicate of the same material in the course textbook). Findings suggested that overly busy online environments that contain irrelevant information (ie, stimulus&#8209;rich or stimulus&#8209;noisy online environment) had a negative impact on learning for students ranked "high" on experience with e&#8209;learning technologies, but no impact on learning for other students (as measured by a knowledge test of material studied during experimental sessions). There is no doubt that online environments contain vast amounts of information and stimuli; often some of which are irrelevant and distracting. How one handles irrelevant or distracting information and stimuli can have a significant impact on learning. Surprisingly, results here suggest that overload affected only experienced students. Perceptual load hypotheses are discussed to explain what initially seemed to be counterintuitive results. This paper examines literature that considers factors that can affect learning online, strategies for how teachers can ensure positive outcomes for the technology&#8209;based classroom, and strategies for avoiding online pitfalls that might leave students frustrated or burdened with feelings of overload.

Abstract:
A unique approach was planned and implemented for undergraduate dental students that would reinforce the principles of removable partial denture (RPD) design. 162 students were grouped according to their year of dental studies (66 second&#8209;year students and 96 third&#8209;year students) within the Discipline of Prosthodontics at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Toronto. Previous training for the students consisted of the traditional Socratic approach, including lectures, seminars, and laboratory pre&#8209;clinical hands&#8209;on exercises. During the testing session, all the students were given the case history of a particular patient. One half of each of the classes was instructed to design an RPD using the traditional, clinically&#8209;related approach, with a dental model that could be touched and seen, dental surveyors, and writing instruments. When finished, various treatment options were discussed. The other half of the classes was given the same instructions but saw the dental model only in animated form choices of drop&#8209;down design features made in a particular orderly sequence as the students worked step&#8209;by&#8209;step through the computer simulation. A pre&#8209;test questionnaire was given to all students concerning their design choices, the order in which they chose the denture components, and their learning experiences. All students were then asked to design an RPD for a different but similar case using dental models in the traditional clinical manner.  Post&#8209;test questionnaires were given to assess the effectiveness of the method of their pre&#8209;test technique, in addition to their enjoyment of the approach. A cross&#8209;over situation followed one week later, whereby each group of students went through the alternate approach from the previous session. The results from the third&#8209;year student data and implications of this blended approach for teaching and learning RPD design are analyzed and discussed.

Abstract:
The Faculty of Industrial Science and Technology at Tokyo University of Science developed a two&#8209;campus system to produce well&#8209;trained engineers possessing both technical and humanistic traits. In their first year of study, students reside in dormitories in the natural setting of the Oshamambe campus located in Hokkaido, Japan. The education program at Oshamambe instills a rich appreciationawareness of humanity which especially enables them to empathize with nature. The faculty has been developing a novel e&#8209;Learning system called SPES NOVA (Scalable Personality&#8209;Adapted Education System with Networking of Views and Activities). SPES NOVA, which is intended to increase competency in communication skills, is based on a remote meeting system that is accessible simultaneously to multiple users via a Flash plug&#8209;in on the Internet. To link users in separate locations, each user must have a headset and web cam attached to a personal computer with an Internet connection. At Oshamambe, the SPES NOVA e&#8209;Learning system links the students to each other and to the professors. In one of the first applications of SPES NOVA, a student puts on a headset and sits in front of a computer equipped with a camera, and then accesses small&#8209;group instruction of a humanity course based mainly on discussion. An electronic whiteboard is displayed at the center of the monitor, and live&#8209;action shots of the users are arranged around the computer screen. The voice and picture data of the lecture are stored as educational materials on the server. Consequently, students can review an entire lecture as well as their own speech and behavior. The teacher can easily cut segments from the motion pictures of the lecture and combine them into teaching materials. SPES NOVA includes an e&#8209;Learning system that distributes educational materials via a wireless LAN during instruction. The system has also been used effectively in an example of ubiquitous computing in laboratory training courses, which included small group instruction. The students are able to browse the systematic exposition of experimental techniques as well as learn the correct usage of experimental apparatus by using a portable video game player during experiments. The teaching materials contain not only the answers to possible questions, but also the lectures for the day. The e&#8209;Learning system can record the laboratory training course lectures and then stream them back in video format. Furthermore, the portable video game player can save images as well as data from the experiments. This e&#8209;Learning system is connected to the computer network on campus. Therefore, students can review the learning materials by using a personal computer before and after the laboratory training courses. When used during the small group instruction of the laboratory training course, this unique system effectively helps participants develop lecture note&#8209;taking skills, hone communication skills, and learn the correct usage of the experimental apparatus used in liberal arts. Furthermore, with SPES NOVA, we can classify individual students not only according to their academic achievements, but also in relation to their behaviour, temperaments, and lifestyles. Subsequently, we can establish a recursive evaluation system for each student.

Emerging Patterns in Transferring Assessment Practices from F2f to Online Environments

Abstract:
This study explores the transfer of assessment practices from f2f to online environments by college instructors, with a particular interest in the factors influencing assessment in online learning settings. Assessment is a critical aspect of the learning environment, and considerable research has suggested various methods of formative and summative assessment for the f2f classroom. However, there has been less research into the ways in which these traditional forms of assessment are being incorporated into the online learning environment, or whether they may even be appropriate. This study investigated the perceptions of seven higher education faculty, with experience teaching courses in both the f2f and online environments, regarding the transfer of assessment practices between the two delivery formats. Specifically, this study explored the transfer of assessment practices from f2f to online environments by college instructors in two higher education institutions: a four&#8209;year college and a two&#8209;year community college. The authors propose that an understanding of both assessment for learning and of learning is needed to support effective faculty practices and enhanced student learning in online courses. Consequently, it is important to study the impact of assessment strategies and techniques faculty employ to better understand various instructional practices that effectively centre on enhanced student learning. A phenomenological approach was employed for the analysis of data involving seven online course instructors at two higher education institutions, a four&#8209;year college and a two&#8209;year community college. Findings indicate several factors that influence the transfer of assessment practices from f2f to online environments. Data analysis points to several areas of interest related to the design of online assessment: time management, complexity of content, structure of online medium, student responsibility and initiative, and informal assessment. Authors suggest the incorporation of tradition classroom assessment techniques in the online learning environment should be considered in light of the factors described above. In particular, assessments for continuous and improved learning are important for the development of an engaged community of learners in the online environment. As technologies continue to evolve, a pedagogical framework that considers the learning environment differences between traditional and face to face classes becomes increasing imperative, both in terms of understanding the delivery and mediation of instruction. Such a framework will need to address both aspects of process and product in assessment. Consequently, future research needs to examine what strategies of techniques are effective in the assessment for learning in online instruction.

Abstract:
This study investigates changing patterns in students use of electronic tools over a four year period, mapping changes in social communications with expectations in formal learning. The data, collected from 2001 to 2004, reflect the views of 2215 university entrants, the majority of whom were aged between 17 and 20 years across a range of disciplines (Business, Science and Engineering) on their first day at university. Although the data was collected prior to the emergence of the contemporary social technologies, it tests an underlying assertion that students expectations of learning are strongly influenced by their prior experiences. Results show no correlation between the extent of university entrants use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) and their expectations of how they will learn. Despite a dramatic increase in students use of ubiquitous technologies over a four&#8209;year period, their expectation of how they might learn at university remained relatively static over the same timeframe.

A Case Study: Developing Learning Objects with an Explicit Learning Design

Authors:
Julie Watson
Abstract:
In learning object design an emphasis on visual attractiveness and high technological impact has seemed to persist while content frequently reflects a lack of clear pedagogical basis for the application of learning objects for online learning. Most apparent is the absence of supportive scaffolding for the student user; interactivity built on an exploratory approach can fall short of achieving its learning objective if support and guidance are missing for the student user who fails to grasp the learning point being offered. Research into developing an effective learning design for learning objects, undertaken by a research and development group in Modern Languages at the University of Southampton, has evolved an explicit pedagogic design for learning objects in English for Academic Purposes and study skills for international students and English native speaker students. These separable learning objects can be aggregated into resource sets or toolkits with multiple usage options for students and teachers. Moreover, this approach to designing effective online language learning materials is based in a defined pedagogy, which also has applicability in developing discipline&#8209;specific learning objects. It seeks to draw on key elements and processes identified in Laurillards Conversational Framework for teaching and learning (Laurillard, 2002). This paper will present a case study of the development of a toolkit of learning objects with an explicit learning design. It will present the pedagogic basis for the development of these learning objects; outlining how they operate both as micro learning contexts and as components within the wider teaching and learning framework of a face&#8209;to&#8209;face or online course. It will also describe research findings showing how learning objects have been received by students and tutors.

Abstract:
This paper reports the findings from an investigation into the distance learning support systems of a UK University's overseas MBA programme. This programme is provided to several countries around the world in alliance with the overseas' local higher educational institutions (HEIs), and is delivered primarily via online courses, but also with periods of face&#8209;to&#8209;face teaching by both UK and local staff. The aim of the research was to evaluate the learning support mechanisms that are used to deliver this programme overseas, and to determine their impact on the learning experience of the MBA students. The primary research method was questionnaire surveys which were conducted over two periods: April â€” July 2008, and January â€” March 2009. The first survey showed a high level of satisfaction with the MBA programme as delivered, but also indicated areas that could see further improvement. The impacts of programme changes were examined in the second survey which revealed students' improved satisfaction with the programme after the implementation of the changes in the programme support systems. The outcomes of this research have not only helped improve the learning support systems and enhanced the quality of this particular programme, but could also help provide guidelines for other HEIs that offer, or intend to offer, blended learning courses globally.

Abstract:
This paper argues that selecting a new Learning Management System (LMS) is a strategic decision about the future direction of your institution. However, the development of a robust methodology for the selection of a new LMS is particularly challenging given the fluidity of the elearning environment. This is especially so when both quantitative and qualitative factors are overlaid by institutional requirements involving political considerations. Selecting the technology is only part of the process and the least problematic aspect. The real challenges are embedded in institutional culture. The paper reflects on the tactics, strategies and approval process involved in the decision to adopt Moodle to replace a proprietary system for the delivery of learning in New Zealand's largest university&#8209;level distance education provider. Critical to the process was the explication of guiding principles, pedagogical criteria and identification of institutional requirements, along with politically astute alliances and allegiances to inform and endorse the selection process. Those centrally involved in the decision process draw on their experiences and reflect on the type of questions that senior managers need to ask when considering new strategic initiatives in open and distance learning.

Title:
Exploring the Current Theoretical Background About Adoption Until Institutionalization of Online Education in Universities: Needs for Further Research
Pages:
pp73&#8209;84
Authors:
Ines Casanovas
Abstract:
Online education in institutional contexts means new organizational problems. The fact that universities need to change to accommodate the impact of technology on learning is already known and accepted. Coping with changes from adoption until institutionalization of online education represents a formidable management challenge for universities. Online education, under the umbrella of e&#8209;learning was perceived by several early researchers as an innovation per&#8209;se, "established and embedded" in educational institutions. Nevertheless, the Department for Education and Skills of UK insists that e&#8209;learning is not embedded at any stage of education. The focus was strongly set on technological, practical and pedagogical aspects but there are relevant reports about failures in embedding innovations in educational institutions. The institutional lack of strategies to cope with international students and new technologies as well as supporting for future online developments clearly appeared in recent studies. Competition in the market of Higher Education has pushed universities towards the adoption of sophisticated organizational practices to ensure effectiveness. These new institutional models require changing traditional functions and roles, as online education does not usually fit into the existing university structure. The transition from on&#8209;campus to online education evolves in new roles, either in the pedagogical or in the administration domains. Organizational factors, more than teachers and students attitudes or technological features seem to mark the differences in the general perception about technology&#8209;mediated education getting successfully embedded in institutional new programs, roles, procedures, culture and structures. The aim of this paper is to revisit the existing theoretical background about the process from adoption until institutionalization of online education and explore the needs for further research. The overall purpose is to encourage researchers to fill the gaps of knowledge helping university managers to address a more clear understanding of the individual and organizational interactions that influence the development of strategies and institutionalization of emergent online educational initiatives. Exploring the current theoretical background it could be found that IT&#8209;innovation adoption models describe very extensively organizational issues, but they mainly take into account educational innovation take&#8209;up, adoption and implementation as isolated stages. They focus on factors and prescribed practices, but not on the human interactions during the transition from individual adoption until institutionalization. The disconnection between individual and organizational IT adoption research was remarked by the Diffusion Interest Group in Information Technology (DIGIT) in their 2004 conference. Since then, several authors have claimed for a better understanding of this linkage. The lack of clearness about the phenomena and a description of how individual and group&#8209;level processes enable andor hinder the development of organizational routines, were reported as a still under&#8209;developed topic and according to the findings of this review it seems to be still an ongoing theme. Consequently, under the circumstance of the transformation that universities are undergoing, the need for a systematic study analyzing the implementation of emergent IT innovations in education appears as significant. Particularly, the process from its adoption at individual level until its institutionalization and the linkage between individual and organizational purposes need to be addressed.

Interventions for Second&#8209;Order Change in Higher Education: Challenges and Barriers

Abstract:
From 2005 to 2008 the international research and development project iCamp carried out a series of targeted educational interventions into existing teaching and studying practices within a cluster of European universities. These interventions were meant to establish educational experiences that would correspond with key features of international, distributed and technologically mediated work settings. The main educational objective was the advancement of important dispositions (skills, knowledge, attitudes and orientations) for collaborating with others and for self&#8209;directing intentional learning projects in such settings. The large&#8209;scale, homogenous and centrally administered landscapes of tools and services commonly provided in institutions of higher education proved to be conceptually and technologically incompatible with iCamp's overall intervention perspective. Instead, iCamp fostered the systematic use of loosely&#8209;coupled, networked tools and services in the realm of social media and social software (such as Wikis, Weblogs, Webfeeds, etc.) to augment personal and distributed learning environments. The conceptual and technological shift provoked by iCamp challenged institutional representatives, facilitators, and students alike. This paper focuses on the description and interpretation of some key challenges, tensions, and barriers experienced by the research and intervention team in the context of the final field study carried out within the project. The paper finally suggests that the reported challenges and barriers represent re&#8209;occurring problems in educational research and argues for the need to develop an adequate conceptual framework for educational intervention that focuses on second&#8209;order change.

The Lecture is Dead Long Live the e&#8209;Lecture
Pages:
pp93&#8209;100
Authors:
Duncan Folley
Abstract:
This research paper investigates if the traditional lecture is no longer appropriate for Neomillennial Learning Styles and whether an alternative blended approach couldshould be used? Over the past decade the lecture as we know it, has gradually been under attack from constructivists, Twigg (1999) for example argues that the lecture is in the main a one&#8209;way process with little or no active participation and does not allow the student an opportunity to learn in a collaborative form. Exley & Dennick (2004) quote an unknown source as saying, "Lecturing is the transference of the notes of the lecturer to the notes of the student without passing through the brains of either" (p3). To counter balance this Race (1999) explores different methods of how active, interactive learning can take place within a lecture. With these and many more damming critiques of the lecture it is no wonder that HE is looking at alternative methods of delivery. This research explores whether there is a place for lectures and if blended learning technology can enhance the learning experience given within a lecture theatre environment. The primary research is based on two questionnaires, the first to a cohort of undergraduate students and the second to academic staff at Leeds Metropolitan University. The results of the research shows that students are demanding more for their tuition fees, this is in agreement with the BBC education reporter Sean Coughlan (2009) who reported that "Fees fuel campus consumer culture" and also discussed the Swansea University's student paper who following the recent bad weather reported "Students lose Â£20 a lecture after snow sends university into lockdown." (par 2). The paper also looks at the effects of increasing demands being placed on students' time and how this has developed the students into becoming more strategic learners in what they are prepared to attend and how much time they are willing to give to a subject. Therefore the use and availability of blended learning techniques (VLE, podcast) was investigated. The research shows that both students and academics see value in lectures, however the traditional didactic form of lecturing needs to change and academics need to embrace new technology, which can enhance the lecture and as such the overall teaching and learning experience.

Title:
A Framework for Supporting Postsecondary Learners with Psychiatric Disabilities in Online Environments
Pages:
pp101&#8209;110
Authors:
Scott Grabinger
Abstract:
Elena has a psychiatric disability: bipolar (manicdepressive) disorder. Daniele suffers from depression. Both are serious cognitive disorders that have significant effects on learning, especially learning online. One of the problems students with psychiatric disabilities encounter is finding support in online environments, especially when 10, 50, 100, or even 6000 kilometers from the originating university. Students with disabilities represent a growing number of students in postsecondary education. As the opportunities for online education continue to grow exponentially, so does the number of students with cognitive disabilities, like Elena and Daniele. Unfortunately, this is often a forgotten group because of ignorance and fear in society. Taking online courses is an important option for all students. As we will see, at the same time an online course can be difficult for students with disabilities; it also has advantages. Access to online instruction needs to be made available to students with cognitive disabilities just as it is for students with learning, mobility, PTSD, and traumatic brain injury disorders. The fundamental question, then, of this paper is "what can be done to improve access, retention, and success for the 14% of postsecondary students with cognitive impairments taking online classes?" Targeting specific types of impairments are not an efficient option, given that even the same kinds of impairments often present themselves in different ways. Rather, this paper develops a conceptual framework around work done by the Center of Applied Special Technology in the application of recognition, strategic, and affective brain networks to improve instruction related to cognitive impairments including attention and memory, language, executive function, problem solving, and social interaction. Additionally, I recommend turning the locus of support for students with cognitive impairments 180Â°, addressing support for students at the instructional level instead of the institutional level, which usually takes the learner out of the classroom. This has the negative effect of making the students feel as if they are not part of the class, and it delays support until the disabilities office has time to help the learners. This just&#8209;in&#8209;time approach based on instructional strategies personalizes instruction, minimizes frustration, and encourages persistenceÂ„leading to better learning and success. [Caveat: Statistics and the nature of the problems here describe the situation in the United States of America and are not meant to make assumptions of the postsecondary situation in Western Europe.]

Enhancing the Impact of Formative Feedback on Student Learning Through an Online Feedback System

Abstract:
Formative feedback is instrumental in the learning experience of a student. It can be effective in promoting learning if it is timely, personal, manageable, motivational, and in direct relation with assessment criteria. Despite its importance, however, research suggests that students are discouraged from engaging in the feedback process primarily for reasons that relate to lack of motivation and difficulty in relating to and reflecting on the feedback comments. In this paper we present Online FEdback System (OFES), an e&#8209;learning tool that effectively supports the provision of formative feedback. Our aims are to enhance feedback reception and to strengthen the quality of feedback through the way feedback is communicated to the students. We propose that an effective feedback communication mechanism should be integrated into a student's online learning space and it is anticipated that this provision will motivate students to engage with feedback. Empirical evidence suggests that the developed system successfully addressed the issues of student engagement and motivation and achieved its objectives. The results of using the system for two years indicate a positive perception of the students which, in turn, encourage us to further explore its effectiveness by extending its functionality and integrating it into a an open source learning management system.

Abstract:
Wiki tools, which became known mainly thanks to the Wikipedia encyclopedia, represent quite a new phenomenon on the Internet. The work presented here deals with three areas connected to a possible use of wiki tools for the preparation of an e&#8209;learning course. To what extent does Wikipedia.com contain terms necessary for scientific lectures at the university level and to what extent are they localised into other languages? The second area covers the use of Wikipedia as a knowledge base for e&#8209;learning study materials. Our experience with Enviwiki which originated within the E&#8209;V Learn project and its use in e&#8209;learning courses is presented. The third area aims at the use of wiki tools for building a knowledge base and sharing experience of the participants of an e&#8209;learning course.

Building the Future Students' Blended Learning Experiences from Current Research Findings

Abstract:
Between March 2007 and February 2009, the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) funded a Learners Journeys project at the University of Hertfordshire. This was part of their second phase of investment in research into the Learners' Experiences through their E&#8209;Learning Programme and was known as LXP2. STROLL (STudent Reflections On Lifelong e&#8209;Learning), as the Learners' Journeys project was known, researched into the experiences of current undergraduate students in Higher Education (HE) and Further Education (FE) primarily through a series of diaries constructed by student volunteers. Using video and audio recording to capture students' own reflections on their learning and their use of technology over the 2 year period the project data has offered many reflections from students on their use of technology for both learning and leisure. Building on this and other recent research data, the authors now suggest that for many HE students, technology has become a ubiquitous part of their lives to the extent that they may own or access regularly multiple items of personal technology that are used interchangeably for learning and leisure, including their computers and their mp3 players. At the University of Hertfordshire access to technology enhanced learning has included use of the managed learning environment (MLE) which is called StudyNet. This MLE has been highly praised by the campus&#8209;based undergraduates and especially those participating in STROLL for making their learning accessible wherever and whenever they want to access it. In this paper we explore how academics might learn from the experience of these current students and their reflections on becoming effective learners supported by technology. This research indicates that technology can be a vital support for students in their complex balancing act between their busy studying, working and personal lives and the students have enthusiastically reported that technology is a key enabler for them. This paper presents the ways in which students use technology in HE and raises the questions of how institutions might support some of the diverse needs of future students.

Multiple Criteria Evaluation of Quality and Optimisation of e&#8209;Learning System Components

pp141&#8209;150
Authors:
Eugenijus Kurilovas
Valentina Dagiene
Abstract:
The main research object of the paper is investigation and proposal of the comprehensive Learning Object Repositories (LORs) quality evaluation tool suitable for their multiple criteria decision analysis, evaluation and optimisation. Both LORs 'internal quality' and 'quality in use' evaluation (decision making) criteria are analysed in the paper. The authors have analysed several well&#8209;known LORs quality evaluation tools. In their opinion, the comprehensive multiple criteria LOR quality evaluation tool should include both general software 'internal quality' evaluation criteria and 'quality in use' evaluation criteria suitable for the particular project or user. In the authors' opinion, the proposed LOR 'Architecture' group criteria are general 'internal quality' evaluation criteria, and 'Metadata', 'Storage', 'Graphical user interface' and 'Other' are 'customisable' 'quality in use' evaluation criteria. The authors have also presented their comprehensive Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) quality evaluation tool combining both 'internal quality' (i.e., 'General Architecture') and 'quality in use' (i.e., 'Adaptation') technological evaluation criteria. The authors have proposed to use the quality evaluation rating tool while evaluating LORs and VLEs. The authors have analysed that if we want to optimise LORs and VLEs (or the other learning software packages) for the individual learner needs, i.e., to personalise hisher learning process in the best way according to their prerequisites, preferred learning speed and methods etc., we should use the experts' additive utility function including the proposed LORs and VLEs expert evaluation criteria ratings together with the experts preferred weights of evaluation criteria. In this case we have the multiple criteria optimisation task using criteria ratings, and their weights. Quality evaluation criteria of the main e&#8209;Learning system components, i.e., LORs and VLEs are further investigated as the possible learning software packages optimisation parameters. Scalarization method is explored in the paper to be applied to optimise the learning software packages according to the individualised learners needs. Several open source VLEs evaluation results are also presented in the paper.

Abstract:
This article discusses the importance of measuring how students perceive quality of service in online higher education. The article also reviews the existing literature on measuring users' perceptions about quality in e&#8209;services. Even when there are a lot of articles on this matter, none of them focuses on e&#8209;learning services, so this paper tries to fill that gap. The article proposes using the Critical Incident Technique to perform a qualitative analysis, which contributes to identify the main dimensions and categories that contribute to students' perception of service quality. A case study, regarding a completely online university, is presented and the proposed model is used to obtain some preliminary research results. Among these, key quality dimensions from a student point of view are identified. Some of these dimensions are: learning process, administrative processes, teaching materials and resources, etc. After discussing the research results, a list of recommendations for university managers is formulated. We believe that both the proposed methodology and the case&#8209;study recommendations can be of potential interest for managers of several universities offering online higher&#8209;education worldwide.

Collaborative Language Learning for Professional Adults

Authors:
Linda Joy Mesh
Abstract:
Institutions of higher education realise the importance of the role of learning organisations in terms of providing personnel training and updating. Yet further consideration should be given to flexible and accessible means for meeting the growing request for continuous learning. Jason Hughes describes an organization's capability to learn how to learn as a fundamental change in the outlook towards learning, not only by providing training for short&#8209;term skill gaps, but by engaging in an ongoing approach for the development of learning opportunities which encourage innovation and enable a more proactive outlook by organizations. Sustainable support for educational development using new technologies in education depends on having a basic roadmap that links current demands for developmental support to a plan for ways in which longer term needs will be recognized and met. The growing demand for continued learning of a second language is evident within the workplace where new technologies offer flexible solutions. In order to meet the special needs of professional adults the University of Siena Language Center (CLA) has developed a multiple&#8209;level series of blended English courses from beginner to intermediate levels for life&#8209;long learners including the hospital staff of the Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese (AOUS), the employees of a local bank and university technical&#8209;administrative personnel. The pedagogical approach takes into consideration both the needs of adults who are working full&#8209;time and the aims of the curriculum, which are to develop the four linguistic abilities of reading, writing, listening and speaking up to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level B1. Taking into consideration a constructive use of teaching hours, classrooms and, above all, the limited time available to adult learners, a blended approach was chosen. This paper will present conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the blended approach for continuous learning of a second language (L2) by adult learners. Through a primarily qualitative analysis of formative and summative course evaluation data we illustrate that communicative language learning online in collaborative activities fosters improvement in second&#8209;language writing and reading comprehension skills, while face&#8209;to&#8209;face (f2f) lessons were found to be useful for the development of conversation and listening comprehension. This paper also demonstrates that online collaborative learning activities in English for specific purposes (ESP) can increase communicative ability, stimulate motivation and provide a flexible context for language learning which adults view as a definite advantage for structuring study time when and where it is most convenient.

The Role of Essay Tests Assessment in e&#8209;Learning: A Japanese Case Study

Abstract:
e&#8209;Learning has some restrictions on how learning performance is assessed. Online testing is usually in the form of multiple&#8209;choice questions, without any essay type of learning assessment. Major reasons for employing multiple&#8209;choice tasks in e&#8209;learning include ease of implementation and ease of managing learner's responses. To address this limitation in online assessment of learning, this study investigated an automatic assessment system as a natural language processing tool for conducting essay&#8209;type tests in online learning. The study also examined the relationship between learner characteristics and learner performance in essay&#8209;testing. Furthermore, the use of evaluation software for scoring Japanese essays was compared with experts' assessment and scoring of essay tests. Students were enrolled in two&#8209;unit courses which were taught by the same professor as follows: hybrid learning course at bachelor's level, fully online course at bachelor's level, and hybrid learning course at masters level. All students took part in the final test which included two essay&#8209;tests at the end of course, and received the appropriate credit units. Learner characteristics were measured using five constructs: motivation, personality, thinking styles, information literacy and self&#8209;assessment of online learning experience. The essay&#8209;tests were assessed by two outside experts. They found the two essay&#8209;tests to be sufficient for course completion. Another score, which was generated using assessment software, consisted of three factors: rhetoric, logical structure and content fitness. Results show that experts' assessment significantly correlates with the factor of logical structure on the essay for all courses. This suggests that expert evaluation of the essay is focused on logical structure rather than other factors. When comparing the score of experts' assessment between hybrid learning and fully online courses at the bachelor's level, no significant differences were found. This indicates that in fully online learning, as well as in hybrid learning, learning performance can be measured using essay tests without the need for a face&#8209;to&#8209;face session to conduct this type of assessment.

Abstract:
A new type of Student Response System (SRS) based up on the latest wireless technologies and ; hand held mobile devices has been developed to enhance active learning methods and assess students' understanding. The key services involve a set of XML technologies, web services and modern mobile devices. A group consisting of engineers, scientists and instructors with pedagogical competence, from seven European countries has designed the services. The new SRS provides intuitive control interfaces, which an instructor quickly learns how to use, provides more flexible and cheaper response services than existing on&#8209;site technologies based upon so&#8209;called "clickers", since it uses the Wi&#8209;Fi or mobile network to provide responses from students. The technology may be used for in&#8209;class, laboratory and distance training purposes, the latter being an entirely new option in SRS technology. We report experiences from using this SRS technology in physics teaching in engineering classes, as well as in distance learning in Europe.

Title:
An Automated Individual Feedback and Marking System: An Empirical Study
Pages:
pp1&#8209;14
Authors:
Trevor Barker
Abstract:
The recent National Students Survey showed that feedback to students was an ongoing problem in Higher Education. This paper reports on the extension of our past research into the provision of automated feedback for objective testing. In the research presented here, the system has been further developed for marking practical and essay questions and providing automated feedback. Recent research at the University of Hertfordshire was able to show that learners and tutors accept and value our automated feedback approach based on objective tests and Computer Adaptive Testing. The research reported in this paper is an important extension to this work. The automated feedback system developed for objective testing has been extended to include practical testing and essay type questions. The automated feedback system, which can be used within any subject area, is based on a simple marking scheme created by the subject tutor as a text file according to a simple template. Marks for each option and a set of feedback statements are held within a database on a computer. As marks are awarded for each question by the teacher an individual feedback file is created automatically for each learner. Teachers may also add and modify comments to each learner and save additional feedback to the database for later use. Each individual feedback file was emailed automatically to learners. The development of the system is explained in the paper and testing and evaluation with 350 first year (1 final practical test), 120 second year (1 written and 1 practical tests) and 100 final year (1 final practical test) undergraduate Computer Science students is reported. It was found that the time to mark practical and essay type tests was reduced by more than 30% in all cases compared to previous years. More importantly it was possible to provide good quality individual feedback to learners rapidly. Feedback was delivered to all within three weeks of the test submission date. In end of module tests it was very beneficial indeed as it had proven difficult to provide feedback in the past after modules had ended. Examples of the feedback provided are presented in the paper and the development of the system using a user&#8209;centred approach based on student and staff evaluation is explained. The comments of staff teaching on these modules and a sample of students who took part in this series of evaluations of the system are presented. The results of these evaluations were very positive and are reported in the paper, showing the changes that were made to the system at each iteration of the development cycle. The provision of fast effective feedback is vital and this system was found to be an important addition to the tools available.

Semi&#8209;Automatic Grading of Students’ Answers Written in Free Text
Pages:
pp15&#8209;22
Authors:
Nuno Escudeiro

Augusto Cruz
Abstract:
The correct grading of free text answers to exam questions during an assessment process is time consuming and subject to fluctuations in the application of evaluation criteria, particularly when the number of answers is high (in the hundreds). In consequence of these fluctuations, inherent to human nature, and largely determined by emotional factors difficult to mitigate, it is natural that small discrepancies arise in the ratings assigned to similar responses. This means that two answers with similar quality may get a different grade which may generate inequities in the assessment process. Reducing the time required by the assessment process on one hand, and grouping the answers in homogenous groups, on the other hand, are the main motivations for developing the work presented here. We believe that it is possible to reduce unintentional inequities during an assessment process of free text answers by applying text mining techniques, in particular, automatic text classification, enabling to group answers in homogeneous sets comprising answers with uniform quality. Thus, instead of grading answers in random order, the teacher may assess similar answers in sequence, one after the other. The teacher may also choose, for example, to grade free text answers in decreasing order of quality, the best first, or in ascending order of quality, starting to grade the group of the worst answers. The active learning techniques we are applying throughout the grading process generate intermediary models to automatically organize the answers still not fixed in homogeneous groups. These techniques contribute to reduce the time required for the assessment process, to reduce the occurrence of grading errors and improve detection of plagiarism.

Enhanced Approach of Automatic Creation of Test Items to foster Modern Learning Setting

Abstract:
Research in automated creation of test items for assessment purposes became increasingly important during the recent years. Due to automatic question creation it is possible to support personalized and self&#8209;directed learning activities by preparing appropriate and individualized test items quite easily with relatively little effort or even fully automatically. In this paper, which is an extended version of the conference paper of Gütl, Lankmayr and Weinhofer (2010), we present our most recent work on the automated creation of different types of test items. More precisely, we describe the design and the development of the Enhanced Automatic Question Creator (EAQC) which extracts most important concepts out of textual learning content and creates single choice, multiple&#8209;choice, completion exercises and open ended questions on the basis of these concepts. Our approach combines statistical, structural and semantic methods of natural language processing as well as a rule&#8209;based AI solution for concept extraction and test item creation. The prototype is designed in a flexible way to support easy changes or improvements of the above mentioned methods. EAQC is designed to deal with multilingual learning material and in its recent version English and German content is supported. Furthermore, we discuss the usage of the EAGC from the users’ viewpoint and also present first results of an evaluation study in which students were asked to evaluate the relevance of the extracted concepts and the quality of the created test items. Results of this study showed that the concepts extracted and questions created by the EAQC were indeed relevant with respect to the learning content. Also the level of the questions and the provided answers were appropriate. Regarding the terminology of the questions and the selection of the distractors, which had been criticized most during the evaluation study, we discuss some aspects that could be considered in the future in order to enhance the automatic generation of questions. Nevertheless the results are promising and suggest that the quality of the automatically extracted concepts and created test items is comparable to human generated ones.

Methodology for Evaluating Quality and Reusability of Learning Objects

Abstract:
The aim of the paper is to present the scientific model and several methods for the expert evaluation of quality of learning objects (LOs) paying especial attention to LOs reusability level. The activities of eQNet Quality Network for a European Learning Resource Exchange (LRE) aimed to improve reusability of LOs of European Schoolnet’s LRE service for schools are analysed in more detail. As a pan&#8209;European service, the LRE particularly seeks to identify LOs that can “travel well” (i.e., reusable) across national borders and can be used in a cultural and linguistic context different from the one in which they were created. The primary aim is to improve the quality of LOs in LRE. eQNet is doing this by establishing a network consisting of researchers, policy makers, and practitioners (teachers) that develops and applies “travel well” quality criteria to both existing LRE content as well as that to be selected in future from national repositories. The vision driving the LRE is that a significant percentage of high quality LOs developed in different countries, in different languages and to meet the needs of different curricula can be re&#8209;used at European level. The main problem of all existing approaches in the area is a high level of the expert evaluation subjectivity. The authors analyse several scientific approaches, theories, methods and principles to minimise the subjectivity level in expert evaluation of LOs quality, namely: (1) multiple criteria decision analysis approaches for identification of quality criteria, (2) technological quality criteria classification principle, (c) fuzzy group decision making theory to obtain evaluation measures, (d) normalisation requirement for criteria weights, (e) scalarisation method and (f) trapezoidal fuzzy method for LOs quality optimisation. The authors show that the complex application of these approaches could significantly improve the quality of expert evaluation of LOs and noticeably reduce the expert evaluation subjectivity level. The paper also presents several examples of practical application of these approaches for LOs quality evaluation for Physics and Mathematics subjects.

Fluidity in the Networked Society &#8209; Self&#8209;initiated learning as a Digital Literacy Competence
Pages:

Authors:
Karin Tweddell Levinsen
Abstract:
In the globalized economies e&#8209;permeation has become a basic condition in our everyday lives. ICT can no longer be understood solely as artefacts and tools and computer&#8209;related literacy are no longer restricted to the ability to operate digital tools for specific purposes. The network society, and therefore also eLearning are characterized by fluidity and the key competence for social actors in this ever changing e&#8209;permeated environment is the ability to cope with change &#8209; or Castells’ conceptualisation self&#8209;programming. Castells’ theory has influenced international definitions of future key competencies. Both lifelong learning and digital literacy understood as "bildung" have emerged as central for the definitions of and standards for future key competencies. However, definitions and standards only tell us about the desired destination and outcome of digital competence building. They tell us nothing about how we may get there. In the educational system ICT and e&#8209;learning are becoming an everyday condition and the basic challenge for the educational system is twofold: 1) The actually making of digital literate and self&#8209;programming social actors – students and teachers; and 2) How to develop adequate designs for teaching and learning for that purpose. We need research that aims to describe the phenomenology of acquiring digital literacy and self&#8209;programming in order to be able to identify relevant learning objectives and scaffolding. Findings from such studies are expected to be relevant for eLearning scenarios as well as for ICT and designs for learning in general. This paper presents a case study that aimed to explore the phenomenological appearance of self&#8209;programming as agency and learning among postgraduate students who participated in a specially designed eLearning workshop in the autumn 2009. The findings relate to both the individual and collaborative barriers and proactive strategies that come into play among the students. Drawing on the findings, it is argued that the presented workshop design contributes to the networked society’s design for ICT, teaching and learning, as the design – at least for this small group of students – have proved to support the development of digital self&#8209;programming as a sustainable competence. In the autumn 2010 the study will be expanded to a larger group of students.

Abstract:
Nowadays, Web based platforms are quite common in any university, supporting a very diversified set of applications and services. Ranging from personal management to student evaluation processes, Web based platforms are doing a great job providing a very flexible way of working, promote student enrolment, and making access to academic information simple and in an universal way. Students can do their regular tasks anywhere, anytime. Sooner or latter, it was expected that organizations, and universities in particular, begin to think and act towards better educational platforms, more user&#8209;friendly and effective, where students find easily what they search about a specific topic or subject. Profiling is one of the several techniques that we can use to discover what students use to do, by establishing their user navigation patterns on Web based platforms, and knowing better how they explore and search the sites’ pages that they visit. With these profiles Web based platforms administrators can personalize sites according with the preferences and behaviour of the students, promoting easy navigation functionalities and better abilities to response to their needs. In this article we will present the application of Markov chains in the establishment of such profiles for a target eLearning oriented Web site, presenting the system we implemented and its functionalities to do that, as well describing the entire process of discovering student profiles on an eLearning Web based platform.

Assessing Student Transitions in an Online Learning Environment

Abstract:
Assessment surveys of students are often conducted in order to evaluate online learning activities. Most surveys measure responses to questions which are based on students’ subjective impressions. The purpose of this study is to examine participants’ assessments made during the transitional phase in an online learning environment which includes blended and fully online courses at a Japanese national university. Students were enrolled in two&#8209;unit Master’s or Bachelor’s degree courses which were taught by the same professor. The total number of students with valid survey data was 184 (92 Masters, 67 Bachelors for the blended learning course and 25 Bachelors for the fully online course). A survey questionnaire consisting of 10 questions measured the self&#8209;assessments of students’ online learning experiences. Three factors were extracted. There are no significant differences in all factor scores between the beginnings and the ends of the courses. These results show the coherence of students' assessments during the course. The correlation coefficients of the first factor scores (e&#8209;learning evaluation) between the beginnings and the ends of the courses are not high, however (Masters: r=0.35, Bachelors for blended learning: r=0.46, and Bachelors for fully online: r=0.33). Therefore, some participants have changed their evaluations between the two surveys. When the differences in factor scores from the initial and final surveys are compared between students who rated the course highly at the beginning (high raters) and students who did not (low raters), the scores for the high raters decrease and the scores for the low raters increase. Also, the relationships between students’ transitions and the metrics of their behaviour were investigated.

Abstract:
Improve students' ability to link knowledge with real life practice, through enhancing children or teenagers' ability to think critically by way of making observations, posing questions, drawing up hypotheses, planning and carrying out investigations, analysing data and therefore improve their decision making is an educational challenge. Learning through sports can be effective for developing life skills because sport has a potential to contribute over a wide range and is a discipline that most children like. The constructions of real situations or “Problems” must achieve and incorporate certain aspects such as (a) encourage curiosity, (b) be perceived by students as relevant to their personal goals, (c) represent a motivated challenge, (d) stimulate group collaboration for older students, (e) technological equipment as a way of support, to motivate the learning process, and (f) demonstrate how simple scientific concepts can improve everyday activities. The aim of this paper is to present and evaluate the usefulness of the representative tasks created by a systematic integration of approaches (electronic and non&#8209;electronic devices) with interactive situations. Four tasks were applied to 140 children between 6&#8209;10 years old at elementary school level. The tasks were constructed considering the follow proposals: (1) promote the benefit of physical activity and (2) explore some science concepts using sport. To evaluate the process effectiveness, two groups were formed, group A was submitted to a more theoretical explanation of the concepts and group B was exposed to problem solving through sport situations. Data were analysed by using quantitative methods. Results show that when children participate in an active way they are more motivated, and the use of their own movement or body to resolve a problem (with electronic devices) contributes for knowledge acquisition by adapting their actions and looking for the best window of possibilities to solve the task situation. Further and longitudinal studies are recommended to consolidate the results.

From Soap Opera to Research Methods Teaching: Developing an Interactive Website/DVD to Teach Research in Health and Social Care

pp98&#8209;104
Authors:

Abstract:
Research methods modules have become a core component of a range of nursing and allied health professional educational programmes both at pre&#8209;qualifying, undergraduate level and at post&#8209;qualifying and Masters’ level, in keeping with requirements of professional bodies. These courses are offered both on a full time basis and part time for qualified practitioners working in the field accessing continuous professional development (CPD). Evaluation of these courses suggests that some students find research methods challenging to understand and the pace of sessions demanding, and has highlighted a need for additional ways to support learning and teaching. There are a number of existing electronic resources relating to research methods accessible to students via the internet, which could help to support learning and teaching in this area and meet the wide range of learning styles among students. However, many are not specific to health research. In addition, the quality of content can be variable and use/accessibility unpredictable. This, combined with the need for innovative ways to engage interest in research methods, suggested the need for a new electronic resource for health research, for use within the context of a classroom taught course. The process of developing an interactive resource incorporating a narrative element is described. A narrative approach recognises the power of story in capturing interest and transferring information and offers scope for imagination and intrigue within learning. A story of two fictional health practitioner characters working in a local health centre was created to weave around research methods theory. Interactive elements such as question&#8209;and&#8209;answer tasks, audio extracts, games and interactive graphics were added to offer varied and stimulating ways of presenting material to meet a range of learning styles. The resource also incorporates a number of self&#8209;assessment opportunities to reinforce learning. The use of voices heard in realistic scenarios arising in the health centre anchors learning in everyday practice aiming to help students appreciate the need for evidence and the value of research understanding.

A Different Vision in eLearning: Metaphors

Abstract:
Metaphors are figures of speech in which a word or phrase that denotes a certain object or idea is applied to another word or phrase to imply some similarity between them. Due to their ability to make speaking and writing more lively and interesting, metaphors have always been popular among students. While metaphors provide significant enhancement of contexts and build upon the sense of community, they can limit the boundaries of the communication between students and teachers. In order to carry out student oriented courses, teachers ought to consider the metaphors students use. In an effort to understand and fill in this communication gap, the authors of this paper have initiated a study that aimed to drive out the e&#8209;education students’ metaphors in order to suggest a vision for future e&#8209;courses. The authors have designed the “E&#8209;Education Metaphor Analysis Survey” that comprised 35 items and captured data about e&#8209;education students’ metaphors. The questionnaire was posted on Surveymonkey.com and was distributed to e&#8209;education students in two countries: Turkey and Cyprus. 352 students filled the questionnaire. The answers revealed that the metaphors students use are influenced by their way of life, their personal characteristics, their educational background and their feelings. Internet was the most common metaphor used for e&#8209;education. A very interesting fact was that 47% of the students considered E&#8209;Student to be equivalent to “rich students’ education” and that the term recalled them the metaphor “richness”. Although there were many research studies on common metaphors and their impact on e&#8209;education, there were no studies in the literature about eLearning metaphors. This paper presents an innovative approach that focuses on 7 key research questions and represents a first step of a more detailed future project undertaken by the authors.

Abstract:
This paper reports on the design and evaluation of a UK Universitys global eLearning MBA programme. The aims of the research were to investigate the learning experiences of the students on the course and to evaluate the effectiveness of the support system so as to improve the programme. The primary research method was a longitudinal semi&#8209;structured questionnaire survey, and data were collected from students taking the course during the years 2008 &#8209; 2010. Three rounds of survey were conducted, resulting in 149 valid responses. The first round showed a fairly high level of student satisfaction with the programme, but also indicated areas that needed further improvement. The impacts of subsequent changes in the programme and the learning support system were investigated in the second and third rounds of the survey. Feedback from these has helped develop additional changes in the learning content and delivery approach of the programme. Overall, the findings helped improve the courses delivery approach, enriched the courses content, enhanced its quality, and improved the satisfaction level of the students. It is hoped that these findings can provide useful insights to course managers and eLearning developers of other courses offered in a global context.

Scaffolding Teachers Integrate Social Media Into a Problem&#8209;Based Learning Approach?
Pages:
pp13&#8209;22
Authors:
Lillian Buus
Abstract:
At Aalborg University (AAU) we are known to work with problem&#8209;based learning (PBL) in a particular way designated “The Aalborg PBL model”. In PBL the focus is on participant control, knowledge sharing, collaboration among participants, which makes it interesting to consider the integration of social media in the learning that takes place. In this article I would like to depart from the use of this pedagogical model, which integrates social media. The article will look at a learning design model, which could be a spring&#8209;board scaffolding teachers at AAU in their pedagogical approach to learning design when combining the PBL approach with social media or web 2.0 activities or/and technologies. With regard to the discussions about PBL, three important characteristics of PBL can be extracted; the problem, the work process, and the solution, which can be used to distinguish between various theoretical and practical constructions of PBL – regardless initially of whether it is collaborative or cooperative. The three dimensions can then be thought of as stretched between two ends of a continuum between teacher and participant control. These fundamental questions of ownership and control seem also to be more generally applicable in relation to wider debates about social media and learning. The learning design model is based on the collaborative eLearning design (CoED) method. The CoED&#8209;workshop methodology aims to support the design of targeted networked learning. The method scaffolds the design work of practitioners and has been developed and tried out in a number of different settings. Drawing on knowledge and theoretical concepts within the fields of design, systems development and collaborative learning, emphasis is on bringing focus and structure to the early stages of the design process. The method aims to develop design specifications and/or early prototypes within a few hours of starting work. In order to achieve one of the objectives of my PhD, I aim to further developing and elaborate on this method, which hopefully will lead to a pedagogical design method scaffolding teachers in their learning designs, taking into account the PBL approach and integration of social media and web 2.0 technologies. This article will be based on theoretical and methodological considerations within PBL, social media and web 2.0 technologies, together with learning designs trying to illustrate a pedagogical design model scaffolding teachers in their learning design when integrating social media and web 2.0 technologies into the PBL approach at AAU. The method has been tried out at the Faculty of Social Science, AAU during Spring 2011 and the article will present some of the preliminary findings in this.

Personal Devices in Public Settings: Lessons Learned From an iPod Touch / iPad Project

Abstract:
Our paper reports findings from a two&#8209;phase deployment of iPod Touch and iPad devices in a large, urban Canadian school board. The purpose of the study was to gain an understanding of the infrastructure required to support handheld devices in classrooms; the opportunities and challenges teachers face as they begin to use handheld devices for teaching and learning; and the opportunities, challenges and temptations students face when gaining access to handheld devices and wireless networks in K – 12 schools. A mixed method approach was used: online survey, monthly professional development activities with teachers, collected samples of lesson plans and student work, and regular classroom observations. Phase 1 findings (exploring only the use of the iPod Touch devices) suggest participants (students, teachers, and IT support staff) preferred a range of devices for a variety of commonplace tasks. They indicated they would select the iPod Touch for recording voices / sounds, listening to podcasts, and playing games. They preferred a laptop for searching the Internet, creating media, and checking email, and they selected paper or traditional options for drawing, reading, and tracking work / maintaining an agenda. Sixty percent had never used the device prior to the project. Despite that surprising finding, 70% of respondents felt it took less than hour to become familiar with it. However, this question did not probe comfort levels with the syncing / charging, iTunes’ account management side of use, and herein lay a challenge. In order to use personal devices in school settings, the school / district needed to create a common iTUNEs account and dedicate a computer to sync, share, and organize applications (apps), content, and system settings. This common account formed a “digital commons” of sorts; a place where participants had to negotiate what apps to share and permissions and access protocols. Participation in the commons required an ongoing exploration of what digital citizenship meant in classrooms and how this impacted teacher’s work, parental responsibility and changes in disciplinary approaches for administrators. Year 1 of Phase 1 yielded a wealth of data. Specifically, the iPod Touch devices were well received and well used by the majority of participants in the elementary and junior high settings. The high school students and teachers were more critical, as both appeared to struggle to find educational uses for the devices. Further, high school students initially appeared to “resent” the intrusion of school issued personal devices. Phase 2 continued to work with the Phase 1 participants and added the deployment of the iPad devices in three additional schools. Probably the most interesting finding was the lack of familiarity of these devices by all the participants. We anticipated many would have owned similar devices and be proficient in their use – this was not the case.

This study explores the effect of the artistic pedagogical technology (APT) called photovoice (PV) on interaction in the online post&#8209;secondary classroom. More specifically, this paper focuses on students’ perspectives regarding the effect of PV on student to student and student to instructor interactions in online courses. Artistic pedagogical technologies are teaching strategies based on the arts (Perry & Edwards. 2010). APTs use music, poetry, drama, photography, crafts or other visual media as the basis of teaching activities. Photovoice is the purposeful use of selected visual images and affiliated refection questions as an online teaching strategy. Social Development Theory (Vygotsky, 1978) and Janzen’s Quantum Perspective of Learning (Janzen, Perry & Edwards, 2011) provide the theoretical basis of the study. The convenience sample included 15 graduate students from the Faculty of Health Disciplines at an online university. Participants completed a 4 month master’s course in which PV was used. Data were collected after final course grades were official. Data were gathered using an online questionnaire based on an adaptation (with permission) of Rovai’s (2002) Classroom Cohesion Scale (CSS) and Richardson and Swan’s (2003) Social Presence Scale (SPS). A follow&#8209;up focus group with 6 of the original 15 participants was held. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected. This paper focuses on findings from the quantitative data with supportive qualitative comments. Data analysis of the quantitative data takes the form of descriptive statistics. Data analysis of the qualitative data used NVivo software. In sum, the majority of respondents did find that PV had a positive influence on course interactions, but also on their sense of community, comfort in the educational milieu, and on how well they got to know themselves, other learners, and the instructor. Questions for further research are posed.

Abstract:
In recent years, user stories have emerged in academia, as well as industry, as a notable approach for expressing user requirements of interactive software systems that are developed using agile methodologies. There are social aspects inherent to software development, in general, and user stories, in particular. This paper presents directions and means for incorporating the Social Web environment in user story education. In doing so, it proposes a methodology, SW4USE, for such integration. SW4USE consists of a user story process model, USPM, and Social Web technologies/applications that can contribute to the execution of the steps of USPM. A collection of scenarios of use, for both teachers in their classroom lectures and students in their team&#8209;based course projects, are presented, and potential learning outcomes are given. The ephemeral and essential challenges in the realization of SW4USE, particularly those related to quality, are highlighted.

Abstract:
This paper describes the design, implementation, evaluation and further refinement of an ELGG&#8209;based social networking site to support professional development activity, project group and special interest groups, and the discussion and sharing of educational experiences and resources across Edinburgh Napier University in the United Kingdom. Beginning with a short overview of what online institutional communities might offer in sustaining good learning, teaching and assessment practice in&#8209;house, this paper then describes the rationale for and development of Edinburgh Napier Education Exchange (ENEE). The subsequent evaluation undertaken employed a mixed method approach involving online questionnaires and individual interviews with users of ENEE, and took place between January and April 2011. The evaluation had a twin focus on use and perceptions of ENEE in general, and how ENEE was beginning to be used to provide additional support opportunities for a diverse group of educators studying on Edinburgh Napier’s online distance learning MSc Blended and Online Education (MSc BOE). Overall the evaluation highlighted a range of ways in which ENEE was proving effective particularly in helping users to ‘keep abreast’ of educational practice across the institution, as well as in supporting small groups dedicated to specific purposes and activities. On the less positive side, the evaluation highlighted a number of issues and challenges around ease of use, engaging in ‘multiple spaces’, and achieving ‘critical mass’ in meaningful use. These findings pointed towards a number of enhancements that were implemented over summer and autumn 2011, and the nature of these recent post&#8209;evaluation changes to ENEE and the MSc BOE group space are detailed in this paper.

Abstract:
This paper reports the progress of a pilot project exploring the integration of a collaborative virtual learning environment (Second Life) with the instruction of English courses at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. An educational partnership was developed with two TESOL teacher&#8209;training courses at Texas A&M University in the US. The project enrolled over 200 participants, with about half from each participating university. Coordination of online activities was done using the Moodle learning management system. A large non&#8209;traditional language learning facility was developed in the Second Life virtual environment in the style of a 1950's American diner on a private island, complete with Cadillac booths, traditional diner booths and tables, and outdoor campfire settings to facilitate conversational groupings. Both IM typed chat and VOIP voice interactions were explored inside the virtual environment. Student behavior observed during the study indicates the conditions which result in the most productive interactions, and also highlights several key problem areas which must be addressed before successful interactions can be achieved. This paper presents a process which has been developed and trialed, and the plans at Lingnan University to adopt it on a wider scale to support the development of language skills.

Abstract:
As the demand for online learning environments grow in higher education, so does the need for systematic application of learning and educational theory to the design, development and delivery of assessment strategies within these environments. However, there is little guidance in the form of principled design frameworks that can assist the design practitioner in the development of online assessment strategies. From four cases, we have identified six design principles that represent the collective experience of our team of design practitioners in creating assessment strategies for online teaching and learning environments; (a) technology affordances, (b) alignment of objectives with assessment, (c) discipline&#8209;specific practices and approaches, (d) meaningful and timely feedback, (e) authenticity and transferability and (f) transparency of assessment criteria. We present in&#8209;situ qualitative case studies that articulate how these principles have informed our design practice in online assessment strategy development.

Abstract:
In teaching software engineering, it is often interesting to introduce real life scenarios for students to experience and to learn how to collect information from respective clients. The ideal arrangement is to have some real clients willing to spend time to provide their ideas of a target system through interviews. However, this arrangement cannot be scaled up as it demands too much resource. Starting from 2008, we have used Second Life (SL) to create a virtual company, named SVG Corporation, which has multiple departments so as to simulate the real&#8209;world business environment. The development of this fictitious company not only provides a new experience in requirement collection to students, but also lowers the working effort of our colleagues in acting as external business clients. Students can practice their communication and fact finding skills during visits in the departments and interviews with the virtual “staff”. The company has been used to support 2 subjects, Human Computer Interface and Foundations of Database Systems. The presence of SL acts as an online platform for students to access and acquire user requirements from staff (AI robots) of a virtual company, through a series of interviews, for system development. The roles of SL are twofold: to reduce the operational overheads in the project administration and to allow students to gain more hands&#8209;on experiences through working on a simulated real&#8209;life business cases. Hence, student could learn how to apply their knowledge and understand the software development process in the real business world. In this paper, we would like to report our experience and results of using SL in the software engineering student projects. Furthermore, the problems and the difficulties encountered during project period will be discussed for future enhancement.

Constructive Disruptions for Effective Collaborative Learning: Navigating the Affordances of Social Media for Meaningful Engagement
Pages:
pp132&#8209;146
Authors:
Patient Rambe
Abstract:
The essentialist view that new technological innovations (especially Social Media) disrupt higher education delivery ride on educators’ risk averse attitudes toward full scale adoption of unproven technologies. However, this unsubstantiated logic forecloses possibilities for embracing the constructive dimensions of disruptions, and grasping the tremendous academic potential of emerging technologies. Community of inquiry and virtual ethnography were adopted as theoretical and methodological lenses for exploring the productive pedagogical impacts of appropriating Social Media in an Information Systems course at a South African University. Lecturer&#8209;student and peer&#8209;based postings on Facebook were examined to understand the influence of Facebook adoption on student meaningful learning and pedagogical delivery. The findings suggest that Facebook constituted a collective “Third space” for student enactment of counter scripts, augmented traditional academic networking, fostered “safe” havens for student democratic expression, and afforded learning communities for student co&#8209;construction of knowledge. Shortfalls identified include challenges of developing quality academic discussions and fostering student engagement at epistemological and conceptual levels to ensure deep learning. The study recommends a multi&#8209;pronged strategy that foregrounds contingent relaxation of academic authority, on&#8209;task student behavior, strategic alignment of powerful collaborative technologies with pedagogical designs, and learning needs and styles of students.

Title:
Can Online Peer Review Assignments Replace Essays in Third Year University Courses? And if so, What are the Challenges?
Pages:
pp147&#8209;158
Authors:
Martin Smith
Abstract:
Essays are a traditional component of the course requirements in many post&#8209;secondary courses. However, the practical and pedagogical disadvantages of essays are significant. These include the increasing ease with which essays can be plagiarized, the lack of peer involvement in the traditional essay submission and feedback process, the usual lack of meaningful instructor&#8209;student intellectual discourse in the essay development and feedback process, and the inability to include hyperlinks and non&#8209;text media in essays submitted on paper. It is suggested that as instructors make the transition from traditional to blended/online instruction, they consider jettisoning the traditional essay requirement and replace it with some form of “assignment essay/peer review” system such as the one described. Contemporary Learning Management Systems facilitate peer review and peer assessment approaches in ways that were not available in traditional offline education. This paper describes and discusses an online assignment system utilizing peer commentaries that addresses many of the shortcomings of these traditional essay requirement. The system is modeled after peer commentary academic journals such as Behavioral and Brain Sciences and Current Anthropology. This system has successfully been used as a substitute for the traditional essay requirement in a number of third year psychology course sections platformed on both Moodle and Blackboard. The advantages, challenges and practicalities of instituting, managing and grading such peer&#8209;reviewed assignments are outlined, and the benefits of the system in terms of student engagement, intellectual modeling, and learning community enhancement are discussed. The peer reviewed assignment system is discussed in the context of recent research indicating some advantages of blended learning approaches compared to traditional approaches. Criticisms of peer feedback approaches are examined, and instructors are encouraged to provide students with detailed instructions and criteria regarding the peer review process. It is hoped that the discussion will be particularly useful to instructors who are in the process of moving from traditional face&#8209;to&#8209;face course context to the blended/online education environment.

Abstract:
Nowadays formal education systems are under increasing pressure to respond and adapt to rapid technological innovation and associated changes in the way we work and live. As well as accommodation of technology in its ever&#8209;diversifying forms, there is a fundamental need to enhance learning processes through evolution in pedagogical approaches, so as to make learning in formal education more engaging and, it is hoped, more effective. One opportunity attracting particularly close attention is Serious Games (SG), which offer considerable potential for facilitating both informal and formal learning. SG appear to offer the chance to hook todays (largely) digital&#8209;native generation of young learners, who are at risk of falling into an ever&#8209;widening gap between networked lifestyles and the relative stagnant environment they experience in school and university. However, there are a number of inhibitors preventing wider SG take&#8209;up in mainstream education. This paper investigates SG in formal education, initially by concentrating on pedagogical issues from two different but complementary perspectives, game design and game deployment. It then goes on to examine game based practice in formal settings and focuses on the pivotal role of the educator within the emerging panorama. This is followed by a brief look at some specific implementation strategies, collaboration and game building, which are opening up new possibilities. Finally some points for further consideration are offered.

Inferring a Learner´s Cognitive, Motivational and Emotional State in a Digital Educational Game

pp172&#8209;184
Authors:

Abstract:
Digital educational games (DEGs) possess the potential of providing an appealing and intrinsically motivating learning context. Usually this potential is either taken for granted or examined through questionnaires or interviews in the course of evaluation studies. However, an adaptive game would increase the probability of a DEG being actually motivating and emotionally appealing. In order to adapt the game to the learner´s motivational and emotional state while engaged with a particular game scenario, an ongoing assessment of these states is required. An explicit assessment, e.g. by questionnaires occurring repeatedly in short time intervals on the screen would probably destroy the learner´s flow experience. Thus, it is necessary to apply an approach that assesses the learner´s current states in a non&#8209;invasive way. In the course of this paper we describe such a non&#8209;invasive, implicit assessment procedure which is based on the interpretation of behavioral indicators. A set of behavioral indicators has been elaborated whereby some of them are derived from the theory of information foraging (Pirolli and Card, 1999). Values for each behavioral indicator (e.g. amount, frequency, seconds, etc.) are gathered after equally long lasting time slices. After each time slice, these values serve as weighted predictors to multiple regression equations for the dimensions of a motivation model, an emotion model and a construct called clearness. The motivation model is based on the two dimensions of approach and avoidance motivation. The emotion model encompasses the dimensions valence and activation. Clearness is defined as appropriate problem representation. A comparison of the resulting values on these dimensions between the current and previous time slices covers fluctuations of the learner`s states over time. The assessment of such changes forms the prerequisite for providing in&#8209;game adaptations which aim to enhance the learner`s state, targeting towards a full exploitation of DEGs pedagogical potential.

Becoming Chemists through Game&#8209;based Inquiry Learning: The Case of Legends of Alkhimia
Pages:
pp185&#8209;198
Authors:
Yam San Chee
Kim Chwee Daniel Tan
Abstract:
Traditional modes of chemistry education in schools focus on imparting chemistry knowledge to students via instruction. Consequently, students often acquire the mistaken understanding that scientific knowledge comprises a fixed body of proven facts. They fail to comprehend that the construction of scientific understanding is a human and social endeavor. Consequently, there can be alternative and conflicting views and theories. To provide students access to an enhanced learning curriculum, Legends of Alkhimia was designed and developed as an educational game for 13 to 14&#8209;year&#8209;olds to foster the learning of chemistry through inquiry. The multiplayer game supports four concurrent players. It is played on personal computers connected via a local area network. The game embeds students in problem solving challenges related to the use of chemistry in realistic contexts. In attempting to solve these problems, students must engage in individual laboratory work using an in&#8209;game virtual chemistry lab. The game levels take students through a narrative arc that provides coherence to the entire gameplay experience. Legends of Alkhimia, together with its associated curricular materials, instantiates classroom learning based on performance pedagogy: a pedagogy that constructs learning through the lens of performance theory. Leveraging the immersive affordances of 3D game environments, the learning experience is designed to engage students in the dialectic interplay between learning in the first person, based on playing the game, and learning in the third person, based on the Bakhtinian notion of dialog. The learning process follows a developmental trajectory of becoming a chemist. Enacting performance pedagogy in the classroom requires a shift in traditional classroom culture toward that of a professional practice community. We report on an empirical study of a game&#8209;based learning classroom intervention where students in the Alkhimia learning program participated in an 8&#8209;week curriculum sequence involving six levels of game play. We compared pre&#8209; and posttest survey responses from a class of 40 students who learned chemistry using the Alkhimia curriculum. We also compared learning outcomes of students in the said intervention class with a control class of 38 students who learned chemistry through traditional classroom instruction. All students in our study were 13&#8209;year&#8209;olds from a typical government secondary school. We noted significant shifts in intervention students perceptions of their identity, their epistemological beliefs, their dispositions toward science inquiry, and of classroom culture. Students understanding of chemistry was evaluated through a common assessment that comprised a complex separation task involving mixtures, solutes, and immiscible liquids. Two evaluation criteria were used: (1) effectiveness of separation, and (2) demonstration of conceptual understanding of chemistry. We found that the Alkhimia students significantly outperformed the control students when assessed on the extent to which effective separation was achieved in the students proposed solution (t75 = 2.56, p = .026) and when assessed with respect to conceptual understanding of chemistry in the separation task (t75 = 3.41, p = .002). We discuss, from a theoretical perspective, how and why learning with the Alkhimia curriculum is efficacious. Our findings are significant in that they suggest how inquiry learning can be successfully enacted in a chemistry game&#8209;based learning curriculum, and they underscore the efficacy of approaching game&#8209;based learning in terms of performance.

Abstract:
The goal of this study is to gain insight into the effects of context on educational game experience. Using a quasi&#8209;experimental setup, it compares the playing and learning experiences of adolescent players of the awareness&#8209;raising game PING in a domestic (N=135) and a school (N=121) context. Results indicate that both gaming (identification, enjoyment) and learning experiences are more intense in a home compared to a school context. However, all of the variance in gaming and part of that in learning experience are caused by longer playing times and better computer equipment. Moreover, the overall impact of context on perceived learning is significantly smaller than that of other experiential factors such as identification and enjoyment. Thus context should be considered as a significant yet relatively small determinant of learning experience.

Sustainability Learning through Gaming: An Exploratory Study
Pages:
pp209&#8209;222
Authors:

Ximena López
Abstract:
This study explored the potential of digital games as learning environments to develop mindsets capable of dealing with complexity in the domain of sustainability. Building sustainable futures requires the ability to deal with the complex dynamics that characterize the world in which we live. As central elements in this system, we must develop the ability of constantly assessing the environment that surrounds us, operating in it and adapting to it through a continuous and iterative individual and interpersonal process of revision of our frames of reference. We must focus on our world as a whole, considering both immediate problems and long&#8209;term consequences that decision making processes could generate. Educating for sustainability demands learning approaches and environments that require the development of systems thinking and problem&#8209;solving, rather than solely the acquisition of factual knowledge. When designed with complexity in mind, digital games present a high potential to facilitate sustainability learning. Digital games can be modelled as complexified systems, engaging players in cognitively demanding tasks requiring problem&#8209;solving and decision&#8209;making skills to deal with ill&#8209;structured problems, unpredictable circumstances, emerging system properties and behaviours, and non&#8209;linear development of events. Furthermore, games can require players to collectively engage in the pursuit of common goals, promoting remote interactions across large numbers of players. To understand how games are currently used for learning for sustainability, we analysed twenty games. In spite of the potential offered by digital games and concrete examples of good practice, we found that sustainability thematic contextualisation and complex system dynamics are not leveraged as much as could be expected. Hence, there seems to be space for improvements oriented at creating game systems requiring players to address sustainability issues from multiple perspectives through: contextualisation integrating the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability; gameplay dynamics integrating non&#8209;linearity, emergence, uncertainty, ill&#8209;defined problems and social interactions.

Leadership in MMOGs: A Field of Research on Virtual Teams

Fotini Paraskeva
Abstract:
As our need for collaboration constantly grows, new tools have emerged to connect us in social networks, supporting the development of online communities, such as online games and virtual worlds. MMOGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Games) and MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role&#8209;Playing Games) are complex systems, in which players are self&#8209;organized and collaborate in guilds; constantly improve to remain competitive, visioning the enemys and guilds reaction. Nevertheless, these are considered to be important leadership skills for the real world, revealing multiple similarities that link the gaming world and the real world. However, despite the significant amount of educational research and the growing interest of the scientific community in MMOGs, there is a lack of empirical research considering the cognitive and social aspects of these games. This paper outlines the theoretical rationale behind a doctoral research project which is currently in progress and examines the leadership skills that can be developed in a self&#8209;organized community of MMOGs. The main questions that this project attempts to address are: What characteristics related to the social nature of MMOGs activate leadership skills? What MMOGs can teach us about the design of successful online social spaces and activities for teaching leadership skills in virtual teams? In order to address these issues, this paper presents a theoretical framework for analyzing the social interactions in multiplayer games, within the context of community of practice, connectivism, self&#8209;organization and activity theory. This framework aims at examining the creation of communities and the development of leadership skills in MMOGs, in order to explore the role of leadership in these virtual teams. The study of the social structures of a group and the leadership skills that can be developed in a MMOG should result to specific design principles that could be used as design methods for developing effective collaborative environments for virtual teams.

Students Constructionist Game Modelling Activities as Part of Inquiry Learning Processes

Abstract:
Learning science requires the understanding of concepts and formal relationships, processes that &#8209;in themselves&#8209; have been proved to be difficult for students as they seem to encounter substantial problems with most of the inquiry&#8209;learning processes in which they engage. Models in inquiry&#8209;based learning have been considered as powerful tools that may help students in enhancing their reasoning activity and improving their understanding of scientific concepts. Modelling, however, in the form of exploring, designing and building computer models of complex scientific phenomena has also been embedded in the constructionist learning approach. Working collaboratively with constructionist game microworlds that by design invite students to explore the fallible model underpinning the game and change it so as to create a new game, may provide students opportunities to bring into the foreground their conceptual understandings related to motion in a Newtonian space and put them into test making them at the same time objects of discussion and reflection among the members of the group. Apart from the meaning generation, we also study in this paper, the students' group learning processes i.e. the construction of emergent activity maps to either plan their actions as they engage in game modelling activities or to report on the outcomes generated when these actions are implemented. The connections between the students activities as they work with a constructionist medium and the inquiry&#8209;based learning activities from which the students are considered to pass when engaging in scientific inquiry also constitute one of the main issues this paper attempts to study.

Digital games have the potential to create active and engaging environments for learning, supporting problem&#8209;solving, communication and group activities, as well as providing a forum for practice and learning through failure. The use of game techniques such as gradually increasing levels of difficulty and contextual feedback support learning, and they can motivate users, using challenges and rewards, competition and mystery. Above all, computer games provide safe spaces in which learners can play, explore, experiment, and have fun. However, finding appropriate games for specific educational contexts is often problematic. Commercial entertainment games are designed for enjoyment, and may not map closely to desired learning outcomes, and the majority of educators do not have the time or specialist expertise to create their own games. Computer games are expensive to purchase or produce, and learners, particularly busy adult learners, need to be convinced of their effectiveness. So while there are many theoretical benefits to the use of computer games for learning, it given the increasing economic constraints in education, their use may simply not be practical. This paper presents three alternative ways in which the theory and practice of computer games can be applied to education, without the expense. First, the option of developing simple and cost&#8209;effective games with low technical specifications, such as alternate reality games, or using virtual worlds or one of the growing number of accessible game&#8209;builder toolkits to create educational games, will be explored. Second, learning from games rather than with them is discussed, examining game techniques that naturally enhance learning, and embedding those elements in traditional teaching practices. Third, the paper presents the option of giving learners agency as game creators rather than simply players, so that it becomes the process, not the product, which facilitates learning. The advantages and drawbacks of each approach are discussed, looking at both practical and pedagogic issues. In this way, the paper aims to offer alternative ways of thinking about the potential of digital games for learning, and present possible solutions to the increasing financial constraints that face the field.

Abstract:
The Brighton ECEL conference in November 2011 was a vibrant and exciting experience, not least for ourselves as its local organisers, the Business eLearning research group at Brighton Business School. With 200 delegates visiting, three great keynotes and a large range of parallel sessions, not to  mention our murder mystery game and conference dinner at the Brighton Corn Exchange, we welcomed the variety and volatility of ideas, applications, pedagogies and technologies on offer.

Abstract:
Abstract: Research has been fertile in producing studies on pedagogical change and innovation through technology in Higher Education Institutions, namely the integration of the social media in pedagogical practice. However, there is a lack of studies on the integration of the social media in the particular field of lectures. In this context, commonly practiced, the teacher faces a wide audience and feels the need to activate mechanisms of direct instruction, for reasons of economy of time and because it is the most dominant pedagogical model. As a result there is a communication paradigm 1.0 (one&#8209;way communication, one&#8209;to&#8209;many, low or non&#8209;existent interaction). In this study, exploratory and quantitative in nature, an approach to the thematic of the exploration of the social media in order to upgrade the cognitive communication from 1.0 to 2.0 (many&#8209;to&#8209;many, interaction between all the participants) in lectures was made. On the approach to the problem, we explored a PowerPoint presentation with the integration of the micro blogging tool Twitter, as a basis for addressing the characteristics of cognitive communication 2.0. For data collection a questionnaire was designed, based on literature, and intended to evaluate several dimensions of the resource used, namely: i) pedagogical issues, ii) technological aspects, iii) cognitive learning; iv) interactions in the classroom; v) positive behavior in the classroom and vi) negative behaviour in the classroom. The results indicate that students recognize the potential of this tool in the dimensions assessed. Twitter integration in PowerPoint allowed the teacher and the students to read each others views and each had the opportunity to contribute to the debate. It also allowed the release of multiple choice questions to the audience, with answers via Twitter and projection of results via PowerPoint. This way, a true cognitive communication 2.0 took place.

Authors:
Chrissi Nerantzi
Abstract:
The idea of moving away from battery&#8209;type Academic Development Activities and silo modules and programmes towards open cross&#8209;institutional approaches in line with OEP are explored within this paper based on a recent small&#8209;scale, fully&#8209;online study. This brought together academics and other professionals who support learning, from different disciplines and professional areas who are studying towards a Postgraduate Certificate (PgCert) in Teaching and Learning in HE/Academic Practice during a facilitated open Problem&#8209;Based Learning (PBL) task around assessment and feedback using freely available social media. The study aimed to explore if and how online PBL can be used within PgCert provisions to provide opportunities to connect, communicate and collaborate in a community of practice beyond institutional walls. The phenomenographic methodology underpinned this research. Participants experiences in this open Academic Development activity were captured through individual remote interviews, a series of questionnaires and reflective accounts.  Findings indicate that open online PBL has the potential to enable learners and educators to break out of academic and virtual silos. It also widens collaborative learning within Academic Development in multi&#8209;disciplinary and multi&#8209;institutional groups. Recommendations are made to Academic Developers and other tutors on how to bring learners from different programmes, institutions and countries together online using social media to create the conditions and the environment for a meaningful, rich and fruitful exchange and enable collaborative formal and informal learning.

Research ethics in emerging forms of online learning: issues arising from a hypothetical study on a MOOC

pp286&#8209;296
Authors:
Antonella Esposito
Abstract:
Abstract: ReseaThis paper is concerned with how research ethics is evolving along with emerging online research methods and settings. In particular, it focuses on ethics issues implied in a hypothetical virtual ethnography study aiming to gain insights on participants experience in an emergent context of networked learning, namely a MOOC  Massive Online Open Course. A MOOC is a popular type of online open course, that provides free content and expertise to anyone in the world who wishes to enroll. The purposes of this article are to briefly outline recent debates on online research ethics approaches and then to explore competing views on ethical decision&#8209;making when researching in a globalized, online and open learning setting. Considering the challenges of this new elearning inquiry context, issues as the underlying research ethics models, the roles of researcher and participants and the integrity of the research process are discussed in their interplay with the evolving ethos of the ethnographical methodology being adopted to investigate participants views. Elements drawn from a hypothetical design of a qualitative study are here utilized to identify an empirical instance that shapes and is being shaped by research ethics decisions. The study aims to answer the following question: what are the affordances (opportunities and challenges) of online open courses as they emerge from the participants perspectives? This paper considers the potential operationalization of the above research question and discusses both theoretical and methodological issues arising from applying research ethics to this specific case of Internet inquiry. In this sense, ethical approaches in online research contexts as well as main ethical decisions are discussed and justified, envisioning a submission to an institutional ethics review board before undertaking the ethnographical study. Topics such as privacy concerns in a public online setting, choice between overt and covert research, researcher as observer or participant, narrow or loosely defined application of the informed consent and anonymity are outlined, presenting a range of different options. This article intends to show that ethical decisions are an iterative procedure and an integral part of the research design process. Moreover, it endorses the opportunity to produce localized and contextualized ethical decision&#8209;making. To this end, it takes into account the guidance available (research ethics literature; narratives of ethics procedures applied to empirical cases); the ethics debates within the ethnographical tradition and the nature of the setting being researched (the specific format of the networked learning instance being examined). The discussion here proposed orientates ethical decision&#8209;making towards an overt and participant research approach, an informed consent intended as a public notice and a consideration of participants both as authors in the online setting and as human subjects embedding unexpected privacy sensitiveness. However, such decisions are considered as many starting points to build a research ethics protocol intended to a degree as a work in progress, in a problem&#8209;solving approach guided by the practical wisdom of participants emerging over time.rch has been fertile in producing studies on pedagogical change and innovation through technology in Higher Education Institutions, namely the integration of the social media in pedagogical practice. However, there is a lack of studies on the integration of the social media in the particular field of lectures. In this context, commonly practiced, the teacher faces a wide audience and feels the need to activate mechanisms of direct instruction, for reasons of economy of time and because it is the most dominant pedagogical model. As a result there is a communication paradigm 1.0 (one&#8209;way communication, one&#8209;to&#8209;many, low or non&#8209;existent interaction).

Comparing Childrens E&#8209;safety Strategies with Guidelines Offered by Adults

Abstract:
The ways our children are using Internet have changed significantly within the last five years: the Web experience is more personalised, social, open, self&#8209;regulated and oriented towards ripping, remixing, sharing, following, reflecting. As a result, also e&#8209;learning has recently become more social and open, involving the use of personal learning environments or social networks. We believe that the schools are not ready for this yet, as strategies and regulations supporting open learning are not up to date. It may seem easier to restrict the use of e.g. Twitter or Facebook rather than integrate them into the  learning process.  In 2011, we carried out the qualitative analysis of 201 e&#8209;safety related short stories presented by students (aged 12 to 16), parents, teachers, school IT managers and police officials, collected through the Safer Internet in Estonia EE SIC campaign. 2/3 of the stories are fictional  they may be based on urban legends which however appear to refer to  real stories. 1/3 of the stories reflect real incidents. We mapped typical behaviour patterns and beliefs regarding privacy as well as the regulations and limitations concerning the use of social networks at schools.  Our study shows that typical safety incidents are not solved adequately when existing regulations are used by the schools. We found that most of the solutions used by schools to ensure e&#8209;safety are either technical or purely regulation&#8209;based, only some schools appeared to have studied or elaborated on pedagogical or behavioural aspects. Problems are defied by limitations and regulations, while actual safety incidents (whether in&#8209; or outside school) remain largely unsolved (or even undetected). Thus there is an urgent need for information and working guidance mechanisms for managers, teachers, parents and students. These matters must be solved before schools reach the critical mass in using e&#8209;learning, social networks and modern gadgetry as parts of curriculum.

Abstract:
We had an Interpersonal Relationships course, a large class, around fifty students, working collaboratively in groups where students from different degrees, academic years, and ages, most of them deaf, tried, and to some extent were able, to communicate. We analyze this example of how diversity can be an asset and how learning management systems can act as mediators to overcome the challenges of diversity and the barriers of emotional isolation. We were carrying out a participatory action research project, within a blended learning environment supported by Moodle, to develop collaborative and personal pedagogical strategies to improve the inclusion and engagement of higher education students in their own learning and evaluation. We were using content analysis of the online discussions held by the students, of the reflective descriptions of the classes, of the students’ e&#8209;portfolios, and of the interviews with the students. The paper describes how, in the context of this project, we have discovered that a learning management systems can be a powerful mediator in promoting the inclusion of deaf students and in establishing emotional bridges across gaps that face&#8209;to&#8209;face environments are sometimes unable to span.

Abstract:
In 2010, the School of Health and Social Care developed a collaborative lifeworld led transprofessional curriculum for health and social work disciplines harnessing technology to connect learners to a wider view of evidence based practice. The purpose was to increase use of technology&#8209;enhanced learning, introduce lifeworld&#8209;led philosophy to the curriculum, release staff potential, and expose students to research undertaken within the School. Delivered to over 600 undergraduate students from community development, midwifery, nursing fields, occupational therapy, paramedic science, physiotherapy and social work, the Exploring Evidence to Guide Practice Unit was facilitated by a number of resources including lectures, group work and a variety of web&#8209;based learning materials. Central to the unit were seventeen web&#8209;based case studies which included the human experience of the impact of specific illnesses (such as stroke and living with dementia) and more general experiences (such as social isolation and homelessness). Each case study provided stories and poems, qualitative and quantitative research and policy and practice issues related to specific topics. At the heart of the philosophy underpinning the case studies and unit was an opportunity for students to integrate understandings about different kinds of knowledge for practice, conventional evidence, understandings about the persons or service users experience and the students own insights that came from imagining what it was like for the person experiencing a condition or situation and encountering human services (Galvin and Todres 2011). The project built on the successful development of Wessex Bay, a virtual community of case scenarios, used as problem&#8209;based triggers to engage students in learning activities relating to the residents (Pulman, Scammell and Martin 2009). This paper discusses the development of the web based case studies and how they integrated visual and audio materials with the aim of enhancing the lifeworld experience of students.

Getting the Message: supporting students’ transition from Higher National to degree level study and the role of mobile technologies

Authors:

Abstract:
Abstract: In this paper, we explore roles that mobile technologies can play in supporting students’ transition to second and third year of university degree study, specifically along articulation routes from completing a Higher National Certificate (HNC) or Higher National Diploma (HND) at college. Articulating students face particular challenges associated with, typically, adjusting to the demands of moving up a level in their academic studies, acclimatising to an unfamiliar academic culture, and integrating into an existing cohort of students. Message of Support, a project funded by the Edinburgh, Lothians, Fife and Borders Regional Articulation Hub (ELRAH), developed a range of SMS, podcasts, and DVD resources, drawing on the voice and experience of existing students, in order to support new students and staff in their respective parts in the articulation journey. Through a process of action research, it was found that such resources can aid the transition process by offering timely contact, reassurance, and information to students as well as valuable development materials for staff. Responses to the challenges of using mobile technologies as support mechanisms for articulating students were identified. Additionally, other areas of transitional support provision outwith tertiary education were identified. The Message of Support project is sharing lessons learned and helping to inform good practice in this context.

Exploring a ‘middle ground’: engagement with students in a social learning environment.

Authors:
Anne MJ Smith

Abstract:
Abstract: The twenty first century student demands more from universities in terms of engagement that is flexible, accessible and immediate. This means universities revisiting their engagement agenda at a time when financial constraints can least afford expensive technologies and resource dependent engagement solutions. Solutions are likely to be varied however they must fundamentally deliver what students expect in terms of engagement. Engagement requires a partnership between academe and student body, but often this relationship is a tension between what universities want to deliver, and what students expect to receive. This complex environment of constraint, tension and expectation means that solutions will be tested by both parties on those variables. In pursuit of solutions it is presumed that there could be a ‘middle ground’ that would be acceptable to both parties. The aim of this paper is to present the concept of ‘middle ground’ engagement, where parties engage in learning using a simple, cost effective and easily accessible communication tool. ‘Middle ground’ is an emerging concept informed by results from a study of student communication, interaction and social learning. It enables freedom of movement for the user to communicate, engage and participate with others. The tool tested in the study is not a formal learning space such as a VLE, or a branded social space such as facebook, but rather a flexible, social learning environment allowing simultaneous access to social networking sites and formal academic space. The subsequent challenge is to shape and roll out a communication tool that is ‘middle ground’.

Fostering a web 2.0 ethos in a traditional e&#8209;learning environment

Authors:

Abstract:
As technology continues to flatten the world and as Web 2.0 changes the way knowledge is created and shared, tertiary education institutions are turning increasingly to e&#8209;learning to extend access to students globally as well as to improve the quality of their learning experience. Learning Management Systems (LMS) currently dominate the delivery of e&#8209;learning at this level. Though these systems have extended functionality by including some Web 2.0 tools, they are generally perceived as a walled garden, essentially embodying the traditional transmission paradigm of teaching and learning rather than the philosophy of Web 2.0. This is leading, particularly in the blogosphere, to calls to break down the walls of the LMS and to explore more open online courses. There is, however, an emerging view that Web 2.0 ideals can be realised within an LMS environment, provided the environment is aligned with these ideals. This paper supports that view. It presents a case study of an eight&#8209;week e&#8209;learning course based on this premise, offered first in spring 2011, with a second iteration in spring 2012, as part of a doctoral programme in Instructional Technology by Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, USA, and designed and delivered within an LMS by an instructor living in Northern Ireland. The course is underpinned by the concept of learning by wandering. The pedagogy is aligned with the fundamental Web 2.0 philosophy. Within broad parameters, it is flexible, student&#8209;centred and, from an early stage, student&#8209;led. Students are encouraged to use a variety of Web 2.0 tools, according to their preferences, to collaborate in preparation for their leadership role and as a language to express their ideas and to share their learning. The teachers role is identified as sage at the side. This case study is intended to contribute to the provision of a framework for transformative e&#8209;learning through fostering a Web 2.0 ethos within a traditional learning environment.

Students’ use of Asynchronous Voice Discussion in a Blended&#8209;Learning Environment: A study of two undergraduate classes

pp360&#8209;367
Authors:
Khe Foon Hew
Wing Sum Cheung
Abstract:
Contemporary discussions of education in blended&#8209;learning environments increasingly emphasize the social nature of learning which emphasizes interactions among students, or among students and instructors. These interactions can occur asynchronously using a text based discussion forum. A text&#8209;based discussion forum, however, may not work well for all participants as some find it difficult to explain complex concepts in words, while others complain of being misunderstood due to the absence of verbal cues. In this study, we investigated the use of a Wimba Voice Board to support asynchronous voice discussion. A quasi&#8209;experiment research design involving two classes of undergraduate students was conducted. One of the classes (n = 24 students) used the Wimba Voice Board while the other (n = 18 students) used a text discussion forum in BlackBoard. The results of an independent t&#8209;test analysis suggested that there was no significant difference in the students’ degree of participation in the two classes, asynchronous voice discuss class (M = 2.92, SD = 1.586) and text discussion class (M = 2.78, SD = 1.353), (t = 0.299, df = 40, p = 0.767) at the 0.05 level of significance. However, the online discussion appeared to be more sustained in the asynchronous voice discussion group. Analyses of the students’ reflection data suggested that asynchronous voice discussion have several advantages over text forums. Specifically, an asynchronous voice discussion: enables students to understand one another’s messages better, allows students, who prefer speaking to writing, or students who are not proficient in written English, to participate in the discussion, promotes originality of students’ ideas, and helps to foster a sense of online community.

Review of Use of Animation as a Supplementary Learning Material of Physiology Content in Four Academic Years

Abstract:
Dynamic concepts are difficult to explain in traditional media such as still slides. Animations seem to offer the advantage of delivering better representations of these concepts. Compared with static images and text, animations can present procedural information (e.g. biochemical reaction steps, physiological activities) more explicitly as they show the steps in an orderly manner. Quite a few empirical studies showed promising results animations have on learning (e.g. Trevisan, Oki and Senger, 2009; Hays, 1996). There are, however, also limitations. Designing and developing quality animations for teaching and learning can be challenging sometimes (Morrison, Tversky and Betrancourt, 2000). Kesner and Linzey (2005) even found no improvement on students’ learning in using animations in their study. It thus occurs to the researchers that there are factors that govern successful use of animation in teaching and learning. Our study explored such factors in the context of physiology teaching. 913 students in twelve different classes (collected in two stages, four years in total) in the same physiology course learned complicated microscopic mechanisms with assistance from animations provided as supplementary materials primarily for self&#8209;study. Surveys and group interviews were conducted that provided both qualitative and quantitative feedback. Results were mostly positive &#8209; animations surely explain contents more explicitly to students (especially for the explanation of dynamic and complicated biological processes), make students more interested in the subjects taught; and there is a greater demand for similar learning tools from the students. It is strongly believed that animations are good supplementary learning materials for students particularly for learning complicated concepts. Important success factors we found included the detailed explanation of content, a good balance between clear presentation and beautiful interface, the speed of running/ loading of the animations, and the provision of more references, etc.

Abstract:
Teaching and learning is undergoing a dramatic change due to the advancement in telecommunication and IT. Increasingly, Online learning platform is playing an important role higher education. The maturity of Internet and emergence of various cloud services catalyse the development of these platforms and student learning behaviour. An example is Facebook, online social network sites, which changes the interaction, communication and interrelation of students and their daily life. There is a growing trend that people participate in Facebook. Given there is discussion forum provided by online learning platforms, students get used to communicate on Facebook. The phenomenon enables teachers to think whether Facebook can be incorporated in teaching so as to facilitate student learning.  Past research on online social network sites evidence that there are a number of benefits including the improved student participation, social relationship, interaction, communication and facilitation. However, seldom studies try to consolidate these benefits and examine simultaneously against the overall learning motivation. This study attempts to develop a model of student motivation in learning with four  Face book benefits : (1) Interaction , (2) Communication , (3) Social relationship , (4) Participation. The students of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies (SCS), The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), studying Hi&#8209;Diploma Programme, are invited to participate in this study. A survey was conducted to examine how these Facebook benefits relate to student motivation in learning. The results revealed that Interrelationship, Communication, Social relationship, and Participation influence significantly on student learning motivation. The results show teachers how Facebook benefits improve student learning motivation. The study also tries to explore some demographic trend in related to student Facebook usage.

Digital Devices in Classroom – Hesitations of Teachers&#8209;to&#8209;be

Abstract:
More and more teachers are facing the decision whether they should allow or promote students the use of technology in the classroom. The decision is difficult as there are apparently both advantages and disadvantages in doing either way. In terms of positive impacts, research revealed that the use of digital devices in the classroom setting was capable of facilitating faculty&#8209;student interactions and in&#8209;class participation, which in turn enhanced engagement and active learning (Fitch, 2004; Partee, 1996; Stephens, 2005). On the contrary, evidence was also identified to show a relationship between notebook use and distraction in class. The pilot study investigated the desirability of allowing digital devices in class in our local context, and to explore the factors that influence the success of the practice. Two studies were conducted with students in teacher&#8209;training programmes at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. In the first study, students were allowed to use computers in the lessons (free use) in the whole semester and then they were asked to reflect upon the learning benefits, if any. In the second study, the future teachers were asked to comment openly on the use of digital devices for more guided purposes such as student response system and e&#8209;textbook. Results in general revealed that it is indeed a very controversial and complicated issue. On the one hand, many positive learning benefits relating to using digital devices in class are acknowledged. On the other hand, distraction is a major concern as students may use the technology for irrelevant purposes in class. Participants thus were also very conservative about channeling the use of computers in classroom to other academic contexts. The answer to the question whether computers be allowed in class thus is not a simple yes or no but is a series of suggestions concerning when and how to do it more appropriate.

Title:
Learning Paramedic Science Skills From a First Person Point of View

Abstract:
Paramedic students need to acquire knowledge and skills necessary to perform basic as well as complex clinical skills, to ensure patient safety, and to manage sophisticated equipment. Time and resource pressures on students, teaching staff and institutions have led health professional educators to develop and embrace alternative opportunities such as simulation and multimedia in order to develop a student’s clinical expertise in preparation for clinical placement. Paramedic education laboratories are equipped with simulation equipment to facilitate the acquisition of the psychomotor skills required by paramedics, and are the main spaces where students can practice essential paramedic skills in a non&#8209;threatening environment. However, often the learning environment is encumbered by ‘noise’ or obstacles such as the educator’s body, or ambient noise from other students, staff or equipment, all which inhibit a clear and precise view of the intricate details of skills to be learned. This study addressed the crowded laboratory and ‘noise’ issues through the use of video learning resources. Though using video as a learning resource is not new, there are three facets to learning that make this project innovative and beneficial to the learner; one, learning from a video composed from a first person point of view (1st PPOV); two, the viewing of the video learning materials using a mobile device such as a smart phone; and three, the use of QR codes to access the online videos. Six 1st PPOV video vignettes were produced for this study. Each video was less than two minutes and length, clear and instructional on selected psychomotor clinjcal skills required for acute care provision . The research findings show that the 1st PPOV videos positively impacted students’ (n=87) learning of the six skills, and gave them a more comprehensive view and understanding of the skill in context. The findings also indicated that accessing the videos on a mobile phone was a bonus. The participants requested additional 1st PPOV skills to be included in the blended learning design across all areas of their Paramedic Science program.

‘As a student, I do think that the learning effectiveness of electronic portfolios depends, to quite a large extent, on the attitude of students!’
Pages:
pp407&#8209;416
Authors:
Jane Mok
Abstract:
Lynch and Purnawarman (2004:50) point out that ‘a solid electronic portfolio can show reflection, evolution of thought and overall professional development’. Research shows that electronic portfolio assessment, if implemented thoughtfully, can successfully engage learners in critical thinking and problem solving, promote lifelong education, encourage self evaluation and allow learners to have a higher degree of control over the learning process (Pierson and Kumari, 2000; Mason, Pegler, and Weller, 2004). Given the value of electronic portfolios, there has been growing interest in using electronic portfolio assessment to support teacher education (Lynch and Purnawarman, 2004). In this paper, we discuss on&#8209;going efforts at the University of Hong Kong to design assessment tasks for a language awareness course entitled ‘Pedagogical Content Knowledge’. The final&#8209;year student teachers taking the course are required to compile an electronic portfolio based on their reflections on the relevance and applicability of the issues relating to dealing with the content of learning in pedagogical practice discussed in the course. This paper sets out to describe and analyze issues relating to the design and implementation of the assessment, focusing specifically on the challenges that the research team faces. In our paper, we draw on a range of data, including student teachers’ feedback on the assessment and in&#8209;depth reflections of two student teachers after the assessment to critically evaluate the extent to which the assessment has achieved the intended learning outcomes. The reflective study shows that apart from technical support, methodological and psychological preparation designed to help students to take on a more active role in the learning and assessment process are also needed to help students to perform effectively in the computer&#8209;supported assessment. Implications are drawn for those who plan to conduct electronic portfolio assessment in higher education.

Abstract:
Abstract: Recently, there are many good examples of how multi&#8209;disciplinary learning can support students to learn collaboratively and not solely focus on a single professional sector. During the Fall 2011 and Spring 2012 semesters, we have attempted to gather students studying different professional domains together. Students from the Department of Computing (COMP) and the School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM) are involved as partners and team members to work on joint student projects. One group of SHTM students is planning a conference event in 2012 with over 300 guests. These students act as the clients who require a banquet management system as well as a delegates managing application. Another group of SHTM students is to manage the development projects with the support of IT consultants who are in fact the COMP students. During the Fall semester, different communication channels have been set up to facilitate the inter&#8209;group and intra&#8209;group communications with the support offered by an e&#8209;learning system, Blackboard. Furthermore, there are classroom presentations given by the SHTM students and prototype demonstrations prepared by the COMP students. Pre&#8209;project and post&#8209;project questionnaires have been given to all participating students in order to assess their gain in professional and business knowledge in 2 different areas, namely database application development and conference management. During the Spring semester, another group of COMP students continued the development and made the 2 systems available on the Web. The two systems were used in a real conference and have received many positive feedbacks. In this paper, we would like to report the group dynamics of our students, achievement and difficulties encountered in this multi&#8209;disciplinary project.

A Framework for Measuring Student Learning Gains and Engagement in an Introductory Computing Course: A Preliminary Report of Findings

Authors:

Abstract:
This paper describes a framework for measuring student learning gains and engagement in a Computer Science 1 (CS 1) / Information Systems 1 (IS 1) course. The framework is designed for a CS1/IS1 course as it has been traditionally taught over the years as well as when it is taught using a new pedagogical approach with Web services. It enables the new approach to be compared with the traditional way of teaching the courses in terms of student self&#8209;assessment of learning gains, student assessment of their engagement with the subject matter, and researcher assessment of student learning gains as measured by performance on a researcher&#8209;designed examination. The framework includes a comprehensive pre&#8209;test and post&#8209;test for students in the control and treatment sections to complete, a common assessment exam module for all students to take, and a faculty survey for the instructors to complete. This enables the researchers to answer many questions regarding the effectiveness of the Web service approach, including “Do students using the Web service approach perform better in the common assessment exam module?” and “Do students and faculty members find the Web service approach more engaging?”  Results from the first semester of a 3&#8209;year multi&#8209;university study are discussed.

Abstract:
Joseph Campbell's Monomyth not only provides a well&#8209;proven pattern for successful storytelling, it may also help to guide teams and team leaders through the challenges of change and innovation processes. In project "HELD: Innovationsdramaturgie nach dem Heldenprinzip" researchers of the University of the Arts Berlin and the Berlin Gameslab, part of the University of Applied Sciences HTW&#8209;Berlin, team up to examine the applicability of the Hero's Journey to change management using an adaptation of Campbell's pattern called „Heldenprinzip®“. The project's goal is not to teach the stages of the Monomyth as mere facts but to enable participants of training courses and interventions to actually experience its concepts using a portfolio of creative and aesthetic methods. While a pool of aesthetic methods &#8209; like drawing, performing or role&#8209;playing &#8209; is already being used, the Gameslab subproject qualitatively researches the potentials for enriching and complementing these methods with interactive digital media and games. This paper discusses three types of game based learning treatments to be used in training and intervention sessions as well as teaching the Monomyth in a game based learning university course. The first option is providing participants with a game that follows the Hero's Journey and inducing them to reflect on the experience and its relation to the learning goal. An alternative strategy is to make participants go through a game sequence broaching issues that are relevant for a stage or the journey of change in general. Last but not least, digital equivalents of the non&#8209;digital aesthetic methods can be constructed using digital games or digitally enhanced set&#8209;ups for playful interactions. All three treatments have their merits and pitfalls, which are discussed in relation to the identified game&#8209;based learning scenarios: self&#8209;study, blended game&#8209;based learning and face&#8209;to&#8209;face sessions. Furthermore, these scenarios are compared while specific techniques boundary conditions are highlighted.

Effective Game Based Citizenship Education in the Age of new Media

Abstract:
Educational systems worldwide are being challenged to respond effectively to the digital revolution and its implications for learning in the 21st century. In the present new media age, educational reforms are desperately needed to support more open and flexible structures of on&#8209;demand learning that equip students with competencies required in a globalized and multicultural world. Game&#8209;based learning represents one pathway to educational reform through its emphasis on performance.  In this paper we describe the Statecraft X game&#8209;based learning program that blends performative game&#8209;based learning with dialogic pedagogy in the context of citizenship education. The Statecraft X curriculum was designed with the understanding that a digital game on its own does not necessarily lead to meaningful student learning. Rather, it is the students together with their peers and aided by their teacher who must work together to make meaning of their in&#8209;game experiences and connect these experiences to real&#8209;world events and issues through thoughtful reflection. With a view to addressing widespread shortcomings of citizenship education that reduce the curriculum to learning about citizenship, the Statecraft X game, played on Apple iPhones, provides students with a first person experience of governance by allowing them to take on the role of governors and thus to enact governance. Central to the SCX program is its dialogic pedagogy where teachers facilitate meaningful conversations among students and advance their understanding of citizenship and governance. In this paper, we report an implementation of the Statecraft X curriculum in a Social Studies class attended by 42 15&#8209;year&#8209;olds attending a secondary school in Singapore. Students’ understanding of governance and citizenship was assessed by means of an essay that students attempted at the end of the program. Students’ performance in the essay was compared with a comparable control group taught the same topic by traditional method. The results indicate that students of the intervention class outperformed the control class students. Our findings suggest that the Statecraft X curriculum has efficacy in achieving the desired curricular learning outcomes. These findings have implications for school leaders, teachers, and students with respect to introducing and integrating game&#8209;based learning in regular classrooms.

Using Social Media to Support the Learning Needs of Future IS Security Professionals

Abstract:
The emergence of social media has forced educators to think differently about the way learning occurs. Students and practitioners alike are using new technologies to connect with peers/colleagues, share ideas, resources and experiences for extracurricular activities. The social business gaming platform considered in this study leverages the social networking concept (an activity that all students actively participate in) in an academic environment. The primary objective of this technology is to foster a sense of ‘thinking outside the box’ and analytical ability through a medium that is widely accepted by students and graduates who have entered the workplace. Both the environment and problems are developed to adapt to suit any academic course from conducting research to proposing business solutions. This study was undertaken in order to develop information systems security (ISS) skillsets through the creation and facilitation of social business gaming, which allowed students to measure their performances of understanding as part of their on&#8209;going learning. The online business game required students to apply what they have learned to problem situations and to further develop their understanding of ISS topics. The problems posed required that the learners had to prove that they understood the material being taught in the traditional lecture and could apply what they had learned in an online environment. The on&#8209;going assessment component of the gaming network was used not just as an assessment for grades but also as a learning tool. This research focuses on a group of final year undergraduate students completing Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (IS). The online social game was utilised as part of the continual assessment process to evaluate group interaction, role&#8209;playing, competition and learning in an ISS assignment.

Game&#8209;Based Language Learning for Pre&#8209;School Children: A Design Perspective
Pages:
pp39&#8209;48
Authors:
Bente Meyer
Abstract:
During the last decade there has been a growing focus on preschool learning within education, especially with regard to the learning of basic literacies such as reading and writing. In addition to this many nation states increasingly focus on the basic literacy competences of the information society, ICT and English. This has, as suggested by for instance Scanlon and Buckingham (2007) boosted opportunities for the sale of educational material and hardware to children for home learning, but also for learning material that links content directly to the curriculum, to school work and to assessment. This paper will focus on the design of learning material for pre&#8209;school teaching and learning through the example of a game&#8209;based platform  for learning English called Mingoville.com. Mingoville has been studied in connection with the project Serious Games on a Global Market Place (2007&#8209;11), where a number of games were followed into classroom environments across nations. Currently, the developers of Mingoville are working on a platform version that targets preschool learners and works on tablets as well as pcs and smartboards. The paper will discuss the implications of redesigning the platform for pre&#8209;school teaching and learning and how this affects game&#8209;based language teaching and learning with Mingoville.

Abstract:
For a child to learn through Problem&#8209;Solving in Serious games, the game scaffolding mechanism has to be effective. Scaffolding is based on the Vygotzkian Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) concept which refers to the distance between the actual development level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance, or in collaboration with more capable peers. Scaffolds in serious games are learning stimulators. The effectiveness of these learning stimulators lies in the way they are managed or regulated. Scaffolds that are not regulated could lead to expertise&#8209;reversal effect or redundancy effect which inhibits learning.  In the current classroom application of serious games, the game&#8209;based learning stimulators remain the same for everyone (“blanket scaffolding”) – the learning stimulators are not managed or regulated. In order to make scaffolding in serious games more effective for classroom use, the calibration of the game’s learning stimulators has to be enabled – this would help in meeting the changing needs of the learners. The concept of fading which is critical to scaffolding is introduced to serious games, to facilitate the fine&#8209;tuning of the learning stimulators to the changing needs of the learners. This paper seeks to address the issues in the design and implementation of a Fine&#8209;Tuning System for serious games based on the fading concept. Also discussed in this paper are the factors to be considered in the implementation of the Fine&#8209;Tuning System in serious games. These include fading decisions; fading and learning rates; optimal scaffolding distance; classroom culture and collaborative learning. The adverse effects of neglecting fading such as expertise&#8209;reversal effect and redundancy effect are also discussed.

Abstract:
Game&#8209;based learning (GBL) combines pedagogy and interactive entertainment to create a virtual learning environment in an effort to motivate and regain the interest of a new generation of ‘digital native’ learners. However, this approach is impeded by the limited availability of suitable ‘serious’ games and high&#8209;level design tools to enable domain experts to develop or customise serious games. Model Driven Engineering (MDE) goes some way to provide the techniques required to generate a wide variety of interoperable serious games software solutions whilst encapsulating and shielding the technicality of the full software development process. In this paper, we present our Game Technology Model (GTM) which models serious game software in a manner independent of any hardware or operating platform specifications for use in our Model Driven Serious Game Development Framework.

Abstract:
This is a case study of faculty adoption and use of Horizon Wimba Virtual Classroom in online courses at a Southeastern University in the United States.. The purpose of this case study was to explore faculty adoption and use of Horizon Wimba in their online courses. This inquiry is based on Yen et al. (2010) adoption factors (organizational, social, personal and technological) and the features of the virtual classroom. The research questions are 1) What factors and features influence faculty adoption of the Wimba Virtual Classroom? 2) How do faculty rate the Wimba Virtual Classroom using the characteristics of innovation? 3) How do faculty classify themselves using Roger’s model of diffusion of innovation? 4) How do faculty use the Wimba Virtual Classroom in their teaching? Roger’s diffusion of innovation was used as the theoretical framework for faculty adoption of virtual classroom. In the Fall of 2010, faculty were surveyed and interviewed about their decision to adopt and use Wimba. This case study provides meaningful information for administrators interested in promoting technology enhanced learning on their campuses and for faculty considering adoption.

The Evolution of e&#8209;Learning in the Context of 3D Virtual Worlds

Abstract:
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) offer new approaches towards knowledge acquisition and collaboration through distance learning processes. Web&#8209;based Learning Management Systems (LMS) have transformed the way that education is conducted nowadays. At the same time, the adoption of Virtual Worlds in the educational process is of great importance, not only for the researchers in the field of Web&#8209;based Education, but also for the educational community that is interested in applying ICT in education. The main motivation for studying the potential of Virtual Worlds applications in education stems from the capabilities they offer to create a cyberspace where users can interact with other participants (through their avatars) or objects, creating new experiences that are not often feasible in the real world. Within this context, the fundamentals of learning theories have to be analyzed, in order to study their impact on e&#8209;learning and Virtual Learning Environments design. The currently available Virtual&#8209;World platforms are being presented and qualitatively assessed. Subsequently we focus on Sloodle, which bridges the characteristics of the Moodle LMS with the Open Simulator 3D virtual world functionality.

Abstract:
Abstract: This paper describes use of an online Student Response System (SRS) in a pre&#8209;qualification course for engineering studies in Norway. The SRS in use, where students answer quizzes using handheld mobile devices like Smartphones, PADs, iPods etc., has been developed at Sør&#8209;Trøndelag University College. The development of the SRS was co&#8209;funded by the Lifelong Learning Program KA3&#8209;ICT in 2009&#8209;2010. SRS has been designed to help teachers effortlessly i) break the monotony of a lecture and allow the students to actively take part in the lecture, ii) increase teacher&#8209;student interaction, and iii) give teacher and students immediate anonymous feedback on learning outcome. The response system was used in mathematics in two groups with different lecturers during two semesters in 2009&#8209;2010. The pedagogical methods in use will be referred to as “Peer Instruction” and “Classic”. In each method the students will answer a multiple choice quiz using their mobile devices. In both cases the result of the quiz will immediately appear as a histogram on a screen in the classroom. The closing parts will also be identical. The lecturer then highlights the correct option in the histogram and explains why this option actually is the correct one. In the Peer Instruction method there will be an additional element. The first poll will be followed by a discussion in student groups, where the students are urged to defend their choice and convince their fellow students that their chosen option is the correct one.  The discussion is then followed by a new individual voting session before the final results are shown and the closing part takes place. The paper will compare this method with the peer instruction method as described in existing literature. The learning outcome will be discussed according to interviews with students and the lecturers’ experiences from the classroom. In addition we will analyze students’ grades and test results in mathematics with respect to their expected level, based on previous achievements. We will present results showing that when students are arguing their point of view, they will have a stronger tendency to convince their fellow students when they themselves already have found the correct option in the quiz. Finally we will suggest pedagogical improvements for future use of response systems in mathematics. Input from lecturers and from students has already been used in the process of developing a new version of SRS, finished in January 2013.

A Semantic Rule&#8209;based Framework for Efficient Retrieval of Educational Materials

Abstract:
Abstract: Retrieving resources in an appropriate manner has  a promising role in increasing the performance of educational support systems. A variety of works have been done to organize materials for educational purposes using tagging techniques. Despite the effectiveness of these techniques within certain domains, organizing resources in a way being adequately reusable for support purposes is still in the offing. In this paper a semantic approach is proposed to increase performance of retrieving educational materials based on using frames.  Here, frames are used to represent the very knowledge necessary for realizing the similarity/ relevance between query and supportive materials. Owing to the complexity in semantic handling of the entire text, the suggested frame&#8209;based approach is applied only to the titles or sub&#8209;titles, or in general the main headings, in the material. To make these frames comprehensive, we have made use of two attributes called “Major Characteristics” and “Basic Constituents”, which are responsible respectively for “the goal behind a conceptual entity (Why/ for What a conceptual entity is being used)” and “the basic elements supporting a conceptual entity (How / in What way a conceptual entity is realized)”. Conceptual entities  here stand for the entire ideas belonging to headings (titles or subtitles) in a material. These attributes seem to have enough potential for representing the knowledge of titles and sub&#8209;titles in a way reflecting the content of the paragraphs in a reasonable way. To evaluate the capability of the proposed approach, retrieving materials within the domain of Multi&#8209;Agent Systems (a subject of high concern in Artificial Intelligence) was picked out as the benchmark problem. According to this benchmark, materials are retrieved based on the user’s desire. Taking this point into account, we made a dataset for the subject of Multi&#8209;Agent Systems as an educational resource in academia, within which a number of users’ desires from different groups were considered as possible queries, and the corresponding materials were then retrieved using the proposed approach. Computer experiments show acceptable precision and recall values for these queries with a quite good balance between them which is represented in terms of  F&#8209;measure. . The findings lead us to the fact that  "Major Characteristics" and "Basic Constituents" have the ability to increase the status of re&#8209;usability for the stored materials. Moreover, the fact that materials can be reused efficiently, leads us to the point that our proposed representation scheme can be useful for educational support issues in the situations where user’s desire is complex enough to the extent that several materials ought to be merged together to yield the requested material.

Abstract:
Abstract: This paper reports the findings of a project "Digital Futures in Teacher Education" (DeFT) undertaken as part of the third phase of the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) UK Open Educational Resources (OER) programme. It builds on previous work (Gruszczynska and Pountney, 2012, 2013) that has addressed attempts to embed OER practice within the teacher education sector, and which has informed practice in teaching and learning in the school system involving digital literacy (Burnett and Merchant, 2011; Davies and Merchant, 2009). A framework for digital literacy is outlined, drawing heavily on socio&#8209;cultural models of digital practice (Merchant, 2011), that has the potential to re&#8209;imagine teachers and teaching, as well as learners and learning  and which, at the same time, address the 'why' as well as the 'how' of digital literacy. This framework takes into account current debates (primarily within the UK but of relevance to European perspectives) focusing on issues of ICT, digital literacy and media literacy in the curriculum, which reflect a tension between digital literacy as a set of skills and competencies on the one hand and understandings that arise from socio&#8209;cultural and communicative practices on the other. Current understandings of digital literacy in the context of teacher education and OERs are explored and the potential for digital literac(ies) for openness is examined. This draws on data collected in the context of the DeFT project and includes meanings and perspectives on digital literacies as expressed by project participants. The effectiveness of a methodology that prizes reflexivity and participation is examined including a range of voices, including children's voices, in the meaning&#8209;making process and recommendations on the basis of the findings are made. In terms of a digital future for teacher education the paper highlights the need for practices, learning packages and tools to continue to evolve, in close cooperation with their potential users, and linked directly to classroom and schools as the site of this production.

Abstract:
Abstract: The web 2.0 has already penetrated the learning environment of students ubiquitously. This dissemination of online services into tertiary education has led to constant changes in students’ learning and study behaviour. Students use services such as Google and Wikipedia most often not only during free time but also for learning. At the same time, traditional information media such as textbooks or printed hand&#8209;outs still form basic pillars in their learning environment. To measure the media usage for learning and how it changes an international long term media survey in tertiary education was set up by the author and other cooperation partners. Until February 2013, 12,000 students from five countries were asked 143 questions about their media use for learning and close&#8209;by topics. The results of the survey include an acceptance ranking of 53 media services, a comparison of media acceptance in five countries, data on possession of IT devices and a comparison of students and teachers media acceptance.

Abstract:
Abstract: Often, knowledge and quality education is reserved for the elite, where there are systemic obstacles to gaining access to today’s leaders. Gender and racial inequities in executive&#8209;level positions across North America have been a long&#8209;standing debate amongst scholars and policy makers. Research has consistently documented that women are disproportionately represented in upper management and in positions of power and still continue to dominate traditionally “female” occupations, such as administrative support and service workers. Though gender inequalities are evidently present, there is also a clear under&#8209;representation of visible minorities holding executive&#8209;level positions as well. In order to reverse these trends, governments across North&#8209;America have enforced employment equity legislation and many organizations have voluntarily committed to similar initiatives. Perceived educational and career&#8209;related barriers to opportunity, choice, and information within these segregated groups are shaped early on. For this reason, many researchers champion early interventional programs in order to prevent such perceived barriers from developing. In this paper, there will be a discussion of social networks and how certain groups are denied access to sources of social capital, thus hindering their ability to seek out prospective jobs or entering certain career streams. In this study, Women in the Lead, a database published in 2009, is a national directory of women whose professional expertise and experience recommend them as candidates for positions of senior level responsibility and as members on corporate boards. The Women in the Lead database was comprised entirely of professional women who had voluntarily subscribed as members. Of the 630 women asked to participate, 210 responded to the survey. The 210 women who responded were from 14 different industries in Canada and the United States. The next generation was described as soon to be graduates of high school. A summary of this advice is reported in this paper, with the objective of providing guidance to the next generation looking to enter the workforce, regardless of their gender, location, and race. We also explore the potential of the internet in levelling these barriers and opening up new possibilities for e&#8209;mentoring youth and building social capital.

Learning Within a Connectivist Educational Collective Blog Model: A Case Study of UK Higher Education

Abstract:
Abstract: The use Web 2.0 technologies and specifically blogs has become increasingly prevalent within the Higher Education (HE) sector within recent years as educators begin to maximise the opportunities such tools can provide for teaching and learning and to experiment with their usage in a wide range of context. The use of such technologies has been shown to promote learning (Garcia, Brown & Elbeltagi, 2012) however currently the manner in which these tools can be best used to promote teaching and learning is not entirely clear. It is within this context that Connectivism, a learning theory for the digital age (Siemens, 2004) has been developed as a theory which aims to provide a model through which teaching and learning using digital technologies can be better understood and managed. Connectivism is however as yet still a relatively new learning theory and not without criticism. Therefore this theory must be considered more fully before it can be accepted fully as a learning theory for the digital age. Within this research a case study of collective blog usage by students studying at an HE institution within the United Kingdom is utilised in order to explore the extent to which Connectivism can be considered to provide a sound theoretical model in which to base future teaching and learning activities of this sort. The views of academic staff and students are utilised in order to explore the extent to which the model of Connectivist learning can be applied to this case and demonstrate the complexities of considering teaching and learning in this way. The results of this study would suggest that Connectivism as a learning theory for the digital age is worthy of consideration and a number of elements of the theory can be seen within the activities undertaken however these are not seen universally across all groups involved within this project.

Employing Online S&#8209;P Diagnostic Table for Qualitative Comments on Test Results

Abstract:
Abstract: The major concerns of adaptive testing studies have concentrated on effectiveness and efficiency of the system built for the research experiments. It has been criticised that such general information has fallen short of providing qualitative descriptions regarding learning performance. Takahiro Sato of Japan proposed an analytical diagram called Student&#8209;Problem Chart (S&#8209;P Chart) in the 1970. The S&#8209;P Chart is able to establish a learning diagnostic table which comments student learning performance in a verbal form. The advancement of computer technology has made the S&#8209;P analytical process more applicable for school teachers. This study examined how online comments provided by the S&#8209;P diagnostic table could affect the students’ learning attitude. One hundred sixth grade students were selected to be the subjects of the study. An online embedded test was given to the subjects and an S&#8209;P diagnostic table was drawn by the computer to display instant comments on each student’s learning performance. A Questionnaire survey and in&#8209;depth interviews were performed after the experiment. Results indicated that students liked the online qualitative comments. This is because students were able to instantly understand why they performed well/poor in the test, which is much beyond the numerical scores can explain. The results also showed that the online S&#8209;P diagnostic table made students more circumspect on answering the test questions in order to reduce careless mistakes. Students would also be more likely to review what missed on the test. However, the S&#8209;P comment table seemed to have no effect on improving their learning performance. An online iterative drilling platform was consequently built to incorporate with the S&#8209;P diagnostic process to assist poorly performed students. It may effectively work with the S&#8209;P diagnostic process to provide constructive remediation for the students who exhibited a poor performance on the S&#8209;P chart.

Abstract:
Abstract: At a time of substantial change, globalization, and ubiquitous access to information, educators struggle to change even the most basic aspects of their classrooms.  This is especially true for those in challenging contexts where many perpetuate the mind numbing practice of rote instruction. This paper describes a collaborative partnership among academics in Canada and East Africa as they develop Innovative Learning Centres (ILC) in their respective institutions to leapfrog pedagogy in imaginative ways, drawing on experiential learning and the Maker Movement in a studio based learning environment.

Using Digital Counterstories as Multimodal Pedagogy among South African Pre&#8209;service Student Educators to produce Stories of Resistance

pp29&#8209;42
Authors:
Daniela Gachago et al
Abstract:
Abstract: While digital storytelling has entered higher education as a vehicle to reflect on issues of identity and difference, there is a paucity of research framed by a critical perspective unpacking underlying power structures in the classroom. This study reports on an ongoing project in a South African pre&#8209;service Teacher Education course in which final&#8209;year students reflected in the form of digital stories on the notion of difference and how it affected their journey to becoming a teacher.  Drawing on theories of resistance, counterstorytelling and multimodality, five of these digital stories, studentsâ  reflective essays and discussions in a focus group were analysed to investigate types of resistance in studentsâ  narratives, their perceptions of the functions of counterstorytelling, and what multimodal analysis of these stories could tell us about the relationship of studentsâ  identities, their choice of modes and their learning. Results of the study showed studentsâ  intent to develop so&#8209;called â counterstoriesâ , defined as stories that challenge social and racial injustice, which are usually not heard in education. Students also perceived telling of counterstories as useful to building communities among marginalised students, acting as model stories, providing an alternative window into the world of students of colour and a space for healing. While only one story could be defined as portraying â transformational resistanceâ , carrying the highest potential for social change, others were important documents of disadvantaged studentsâ  fight for survival, and might well challenge some of the existing power structures in their classroom. Multimodal analysis of the stories revealed contradictory elements, highlighting the difficulty for students to resist dominant discourses, but also showing the increasing (conscious or unconscious) emotional audience manipulation evidenced in production of digital stories by the more privileged students. We suggest that engaging students in multimodal analysis of their own stories could facilita

Abstract:
Abstract: Since the enrolment of its first cohort of students in 2009, the University of Botswana School of Medicine (UB SoM) has employed elearning as a key element to support and strengthen its model of decentralised medical education. Significant investments have been made in setting up the physical infrastructure, and in acquiring relevant expertise to develop and implement an elearning agenda in a context with practical challenges associated with medical education in decentralised setup. Following the enrolment of its first cohorts of medical students, and residents in Paediatrics and Internal Medicine between 2009 and 2010, the School also launched a Family Medicine training programme in 2011 at two rural sites. With the expectation of contributing to a positive teaching and learning environment for faculty, residents, and medical students in these remote areas, elearning is also seen as important for their retention, and thus for improved access to quality health care in rural Botswana. In this paper, the authors critically reflect on the strategies used to implement elearning at UB SoM over the past 18 months, and highlight challenges experienced while implementing elearning in a new medical school situated within an older university context. Strong relationships with partners were identified as a critical foundation for the long&#8209;term sustainability beyond the initial procurement and installation infrastructure. While confirming the obvious technical challenges in a setting like Botswana, the authors emphasise the need not to underestimate associated broader challenges in engaging a diverse range of users, partners and stakeholders; not to lose sight of the pedagogical goals that are meant to drive the choice and use of technology (rather than vice versa); and to ensure that the expected benefits of the technology can and will be shared and sustained by a range of partners in the long run.

Abstract:
Abstract: CTI is an accredited private higher education institution (university) with the Higher Education Council (HEC) in South Africa. Its head office is in Fourways, Johannesburg. CTI has 12 campuses nationwide and offers higher certificates and degrees in commerce and information technology. These BCom and BSc degrees were rolled out to all 12 campuses from January 2013. All first year students received 10⠜ Samsung tablets with their textbooks and course materials in digital format. We⠒ve worked closely with all role&#8209;players to ensure that all pillars for successful implementation of the e&#8209;book tablet project are in place. Timeous completion and conversion of course materials and e&#8209;textbooks for the start of the academic year in 2013 took extra time and focus of a dedicated project manager and multi&#8209;disciplinary team members. Several aspects were focused on during the conceptual, preparation and planning phases in 2012 (phase 1). This phase included aspects such as the student pilot project to establish the most suitable tablet to procure for students and lecturers, upgrading of infrastructure on campuses, lecturer training and the development of support materials, guidelines and rules for user standards. Phase 2 started in January 2013 with the implementation of a design&#8209;based research project which includes several planned interventions to ensure continuous development and support of lecturers and students with the focus on enhancing the academic experience of students. During this phase qualitative and quantitative methodologies were implemented and included the sharing of experiences using different digital media, tools and instruments to gather data from lecturers, students and other role&#8209;players. Data was analysed and compared with different theoretical frameworks for using integrating innovative technologies in learning environments. Changes that took place in teaching and learning practices will be discussed by way of using the technology integration matrix and other measurements to determine the development and movement of teachin

Brown Bully Onguko
Abstract:
Abstract: JiFUNzeni blended learning approach is a sustainable approach to provision of professional development (PD) for those in challenging educational contexts. JiFUNzeni approach emphasizes training regional experts to create blended learning content, working with appropriate technology while building content repositories. JiFUNzeni approach was field&#8209;tested though a design&#8209;based research intervention conducted in rural western Kenya. The field test included design, development and implementation of a blended learning course for teachers professional development utilizing appropriate technologies including tablets powered by solar energy, open educational resources and open source software. One year after the intervention, follow&#8209;up interviews were conducted with eight of the ten teachers and two professional development tutors (PDTs) who participated in the research. The findings from the follow&#8209;up interviews shared in this paper revealed that: teachers still used cooperative learning and activity&#8209;based learning strategies in their teaching. The PDTs on the other hand designed, developed and implemented one other jiFUNzeni blended learning course for twelve teachers in one school in Korogocho slum in Nairobi city. Implementation by PDTs of jiFUNzeni approach confirmed that they had learned through a sustainable way of delivering professional development in challenging educational contexts. The PDTs utilized the instructional design approaches learned through their participation in the research in designing blended learning content, while they also innovated new ways of developing self&#8209;study content as an important creative addition to what they had previously learned. Two teenage children participated in digital content development by advising the PDTs on some appropriate ways of applying technology thus, attesting to the fact that digital natives are important reciprocal supporters to digital immigrants and vice versa.

Abstract:
Abstract: The technological advancements for teaching and learning sciences for health science students are embedded in the Thalluri&#8209;Penman Good Practice Model, which aims to improve the learning experiences of science students and increase student retention and success rates.  The model also links students from urban and rural areas, studying both on&#8209; and off&#8209;campus, with the university campus and with co&#8209;students and is primarily structured to boost students confidence in studying sciences.  This paper investigates the introduction of online initiatives, namely, electronic learning communities, online self&#8209;assessments, virtual classroom, and the inclusion of social media Facebook to offer practically oriented science learning to urban and regional science students.  It examines the issues surrounding the implementation of these technological innovations by identifying the perceptions of the students about their use, illuminating their impact on students, and clarifying the practical issues encountered in the application of these online initiatives.  A descriptive analytical approach was used to explore the experiences of students in the use of these innovations.  Findings of the evaluations show that the technology exemplified in this paper provides: an approximation of face&#8209;to&#8209;face lecturing when it is not possible for a lecturer to be at the same site as the class; enhance communication between students and lecturers; and help students access, collaborate and interact with each other.  The use of technology that is carefully considered in each stage of the program has been shown to enhance the quality of university teaching and learning, allowing students greater accessibility, flexibility and interaction.

Mswazi Tshabalala et al
Abstract:
Abstract: Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are striving to provide effective learning experiences to address the needs of the digitally&#8209;oriented generation of learners. Blended learning has emerged as a solution to address these needs and has been adopted by various HEIs. However, not all academic staff members adopt blended learning when it is introduced by their institutions. Although this teaching and learning approach offers various advantages to academic staff, negative perceptions held by academic staff may affect its adoption.The purpose of this case study was to investigate the perceptions academic staff have about blended learning and to identify challenges facing academic staff that affected the adoption of blended learning in a Faculty of Education at a developing university in South Africa.  The study employed the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) developed by Davis (1993) and the Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT) by Rogers (1983: 246&#8209;250) in a qualitative exploratory research design. The investigation made use of focus group interviews with lecturers and individual interviews with heads of academic departments, as well as the dean of the Faculty. Data gathered pointed to various perceptions and practical problems hindering academic staff from adopting blended learning. Amongst these were perceptions pertaining to e&#8209;learning or blended learning policy, faculty support by management, computer skills of students and lecturers, as well as inadequate access for students to computers. This research is unique in that it applies known knowledge in the new context of a small South African university, which is a developing community. Lessons learned from this study will make a contribution to knowledge in the field of higher education, and will help developing universities to benefit from the research.

Abstract:
Abstract: Today's graduates need the skills to enable them to 'persevere in the face of complexity and unresolvability' (McWilliam and Haukka 2008: 660), and to respond creatively in work environments that are increasingly dependent on digital technologies (Cunningham 2006). However, although many higher education institutions (HEIs) acknowledge the importance of creativity within the curriculum (McWilliam 2007a), it is argued that universities are failing to equip graduates with the creative skills they require to be effective in the workplace. Design&#8209;based learning (also referred to as learning by design) is ideally suited to facilitating the development of creative problem solving (CPS) skills by engaging students in complex learning activities involving the active construction of knowledge through a series of iterative cycles of experimentation and refinement of concepts (Naidu 2004). Similarly, design&#8209;based research (DBR) involves a series of iterative steps to design and develop learning environments and theories the design, while also informing the development of practical guidelines (Reeves, Herrington and Oliver, 2005). This paper reports on findings from a project funded by the Australian Government Office for Learning and Teaching, which aimed to develop a CPS framework and supporting online system to scaffold teachers and students through a creative problem solving approach founded on the principles of DBR. The study employed a mixed&#8209;methods DBR approach involving multiple iterations to design, develop, trial and implement the framework and tool, as well as the development of principles and practical guidelines for application in the classroom. The findings reported in this paper focus on the DBR process and the experience trialling the CPS tool in a first&#8209;year undergraduate course offered in the School of Communication, International Studies and Languages at the University of South Australia. The paper reports on the implications of the findings from the project and the benefits of DBR as a methodology informing the design, development

Abstract:
A basic framework is proposed to distinguish between the many ways in which Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) can be evaluated. This includes the purpose of the evaluation, the type of methods that might be used and the measures employed. The framework is not intended to cover all applications but offers one means of structuring a review of past studies or may provide guidance on the type of study to conduct. A pilot study is introduced which compares an online course using different platforms which aims to measure engagement, participation and achievement of goals.

Abstract:
The studies described in this paper sought to investigate several forms of online learning and assessment methods in terms their efficacy in facilitating student learning. The studies also sought to investigate how participants rated each method. Attitudes toward computer&#8209;assisted learning were not related to performance on each of the online methods employed, whereas some relationships were noted between cognitive styles and online learning and assessment. Finally, evaluation feedback from participants indicated that each online task was rated positively. Implications of the findings for further implementation of online instructional methods are discussed.

Integrating Distributed Learning with just&#8209;in&#8209;context Knowledge Management
Pages:

Authors:
Roy. Williams
Abstract:
This paper addresses some key design issues in e&#8209;learning, and its integration with knowledge management. The underlying premise is that the purpose of e&#8209;learning is useful knowledge, and that the design of e&#8209;learning should therefore be integrated with the design of related knowledge management — particularly personal knowledge management. e&#8209;learning will be explored using the notion of "distributed learning". Knowledge management will be explored using the notion of "just&#8209;in&#8209;context knowledge", emphasising both the contextual underpinning of knowledge, and its strategic value — that is to say its applied value, and its embeddedness in decision making processes. The potential for distributed learning to optimise shared resources is also explored.

Abstract:
Abstract: The most important dimension of learning is the content, and an LMS suffices this to a certain extent. The present day LMS are designed to primarily address issues like ease of use, search, content and performance. Many surveys had been conducted to identify the essential features required for the improvement of LMS, which includes flexibility and a user centric approach. These features can suffice the need of all learners, when they have different learning requirements. For a true learning, knowledge should also be delivered along with the domain information. Thus, there is a need to design an architecture for user centric Knowledge Driven Learning Management System. Thus for holistic learning, knowledge enriched teaching skills are required, which can enhance and increase the thinking skills of the learner to a higher level. The current LMS needs an improvement in the direction of knowledge discovery, exploration so that knowledge enriched learning can be provided to the learner.. It can be based on knowledge engineering principles like ontology, semantic relationship between objects, cognitive approach and data mining techniques. In this paper, we are proposing an idea of an enhanced Learning Object (LO) called Knowledge Driven Learning Object, which can be delivered to the user for better learning. We had used a data mining approach, classification to harness and exploit these objects and classify them according to their metadata, thereby strengthening the content of objects delivered through the LMS.

Abstract:
Abstract: Really Simple Syndication (RSS) offers a means for university students to receive timely updates from virtual learning environments. However, despite its utility, only 21% of home students surveyed at a university in Lebanon claim to have ever used the technology. To investigate whether national culture could be an influence on intention to use RSS, the survey was extended to British students in the UK. Using the Technology Adoption Model (TAM) as a research framework, 437 students responded to a questionnaire containing four constructs: behavioural intention to use; attitude towards benefit; perceived usefulness; and perceived ease of use. Principle components analysis and structural equation modelling were used to explore the psychometric qualities and utility of TAM in both contexts. The results show that adoption was significantly higher, but also modest, in the British context at 36%. Configural and metric invariance were fully supported, while scalar and factorial invariance were partially supported. Further analysis shows significant differences between perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use across the two contexts studied. Therefore, it is recommended that faculty demonstrate to students how educational RSS feeds can be used effectively to increase awareness and emphasise usefulness in both contexts.

Abstract:
Abstract: Simpler is better. There are a lot of needs in e&#8209;Learning, and theres often a limit to the time, talent, and money that can be thrown at them individually. Contemporary pedagogy in technology and engineering disciplines, within the higher education context, champion instructional designs that emphasize peer instruction and rich formative feedback. However, it can be challenging to maintain student engagement outside the traditional classroom environment and ensure that students receive feedback in time to help them with ongoing assignments. The use of virtual learning platforms, such as Blackboard Learn, and web feed syndication, using technology such as Rich Site Summaries (RSS), can help overcome such challenges. However, during an initial pilot at an institution in Lebanon, only 21% of students reported making use of both these facilities. In this study, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was used to guide the development of a scale to be used to investigate antecedents to the use of web feeds. The proposed scale was reviewed by 4 experts and piloted with 235 students. The collected data were analysed using structural equation modeling (SEM) technique based on AMOS methods. The results revealed adequate face, content, and construct validity. However, perceived ease of use was not a significant predictor of attitude towards use. Overall, the proposed model achieves acceptable fit and explains for 38% of its variance of which is lower than that of the original TAM. This suggests that aspects of the model may lack criterion validity in the Lebanese context. Consequently, it may be necessary to extend the scale by capturing additional moderators and predictors, such as cultural values and subjective norms. We concluded that the existence of RSS feeds in education improves significantly the content presented by the instructors to the e&#8209;learning user decreasing at the same time the size and access cost.

Authors:
Sari Mettiäinen
Abstract:
Abstract: The aim of this study was to determine nursing teachers and students attitudes to and experiences of using an electronic assessment and feedback tool in supervision of clinical training. The tool was called eTaitava, and it was developed in Finland.  During the pilot project, the software was used by 12 nursing teacher and 430 nursing students. Nine of the teachers participated in the interviews and survey, and 112 students responded to the survey. The data were mainly analysed with qualitative methods.In the eTaitava web&#8209;based user interface, the teacher constructs questions to map the students learning process, and sets them to be sent on a daily basis. According to the findings, four&#8209;fifths of the students responded to the questions almost daily. They thought the software was easy to use and answering the questions took about 5 minutes a day. Based on the students and teachers experiences, the use of the electronic assessment and feedback tool supported supervision of clinical training. It supported the students target&#8209;oriented learning, supervised the students daily work, and made it visible for the teachers. Responding to the software questions inspired the students cognitive learning, and based on the responses, the teachers noticed which students needed more support and could consequently allocate them more supervision time. Responding also supported the students continuous self&#8209;evaluation, and considering the responses structured the students and teachers final assessment discussion.  By means of the electronic assessment and feedback tool, it is possible to promote learning during clinical training by challenging students to reflect on their learning experiences. Students professional development process can be supported through pedagogically planned conceptual supervision which is integrated into experiential learning during clinical training.The findings of the pilot study were encouraging, indicating that the method is worth further development and potentially useful in supervision in all fields of education.

Problem Based Learning and Authentic Assessment in Digital Pedagogy: Embracing the Role of Collaborative Communities

Dr. W. Barber

Abstract:
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to qualitatively examine the relationship between a problem&#8209;based learning context, authentic assessment and the role of community in fostering learning in digital contexts. The authors used Digital Moments to create a meaningful learning environment and build the online class community. They then collaboratively developed assessment strategies and tools with students following problem&#8209;based learning methodologies.  Given that the pace of information is rapid and changing, the authors argue that online learning must occur in a context that embraces these three concepts  1. Students must be empowered through PBL to choose real world tasks to demonstrate their knowledge, 2. Students are allowed to choose the modality to represent that knowledge and participate in designing the tools for assessing that knowledge and 3. They do so in a supportive online community built through the sharing of Digital Moments.  The paper chronicles the interconnection between problem based learning, authentic real world assessment tasks and a supportive online community.  This resulted in developing learner autonomy, improving student engagement and motivation, greater use of meaningful self and peer assessments and shared development of collective knowledge.. Further to this, it builds a foundation from which authentic assessment, student ownership of learning and peer support can occur in an ongoing way as learners make the important shifts in power to owning their learning and becoming problem&#8209;based inquirers in future courses.  As a result, in order to fully embrace the online learning environment, we cannot limit ourselves to simple text based measures of student achievement.  Stepping into this brave new world requires innovation, creativity and tenacity, and the courage to accept that as the nature of knowledge has evolved in the digital landscape, so must our means of assessing it.

Abstract:
Abstract: This paper reports on a study carried out at a University of Technology, South Africa, aimed at identifying the existence of the mathematical knowledge gap and evaluating the intervention designed to bridge the knowledge gap amongst students studying first year mathematics at the Chemical Engineering Extended Curriculum Program (ECP). In this study, a pre&#8209;test was used as a diagnostic test to test incoming Chemical Engineering students, with the aim of identifying the mathematical knowledge gap, and to provide students with support in their starting level of mathematical knowledge and skills. After the diagnostic test, an intervention called the autumn school was organized to provide support to bridge the mathematical knowledge gap identified. A closed Facebook group served as a platform for providing student support after school hours. After the autumn school, a post&#8209;test was administered to measure whether there was an improvement in the knowledge gap. Both quantitative and qualitative methods of collecting data were used in this study. A pre&#8209;test was used to identify the mathematical knowledge gap, while a post&#8209;test was employed to measure whether there was a decrease in the knowledge gap after the intervention. Focus group interviews were carried out with the students to elicit their opinions on whether the intervention was of any help for them.  Students participation on Facebook in terms of student post, post comments and likes and an evaluation of students academic performance in comparison to their Facebook individual participation was also conducted. Quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics, while qualitative data was analysed using inductive strategy. Results showed that all the students in this study had the mathematical knowledge gap as no student in the class scored 50% on the overall pre&#8209;test. Findings further revealed that the intervention played a major role in alleviating the mathematical knowledge gap from some of the students (with 1/3 of the students scoring 50% and above in the post&#8209;test) and no positive correlation between students academic performance on the post&#8209;test and students participation in the Facebook group was noted. We hope that insights generated in this study will be of help to other institutions looking into designing interventions for bridging the knowledge gap. Reasons for lack of improvement in the knowledge gap of 2/3 of the students in this class will be highlighted.

Telling Tales: Towards a new Model of Literacy Development Using e&#8209;Readers in Teacher Education in Chile

Authors:
Paula Charbonneau-Gowdy
Abstract:
Abstract: Current debates on quality standards in education often look to the levels of an increasingly diverse array of literacies as a measure of that standard. At the same time, while mobile technologies are profoundly changing the way we live, communicate and learn in our everyday lives, relatively little seems to be known about their potential to influence even basic literacy in formal education sites. Examining the use of practical and affordable emerging technologies in many countries worldwide where literacy rates are an issue, seems as yet to have been overlooked. Considering the implication of multiple literacy and communication skills to economic and cultural development and stability in emerging countries and increasingly in developed ones as well, finding immediate answers to challenges in this area is critical. This paper reports on a longitudinal study that examined the power of e&#8209;readers to support change in the literacy habits and ultimately the learning cultures of a group of English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers&#8209;in&#8209;training in Chile. The aim of the study was to determine if access to low&#8209;cost mobile readers and a social&#8209;learning driven, technology&#8209;supported, guided reading program, could reverse their literacy challenges. The study is based on social&#8209;cultural theory in which learner agency, access to funds of knowledge and social interaction are imperative ingredients for developing engaged, life&#8209;long learners and readers.  Participatory Action Research (PAR) is used to conduct the inquiry. Working within a qualitative research paradigm, ethnographic tools and numerical data from pre&#8209; and post&#8209;test results, helped to uncover how the use of technology influenced both the literacy practices and identities of the teachers&#8209;in&#8209;training. The findings have led to the proposal of a new 21st century model for literacy education for such challenging contexts. This model could have important implications for Chile as well as learners, educators and policy makers elsewhere.

Abstract:
Abstract: The paper explores the role of Open Access (in licensing, publishing and sharing research data) and Open Educational Resources within Distance Education, with a focus on the context of the University of London International Programmes. We report on a case study where data were gathered from librarians and programme directors relating to existing practice around Open Access; the major constraints in using Open Educational Resources and the main resource implications, when adopting Open Educational Resources, were also investigated. Our aim was to (a) raise awareness and understanding of what is possible to achieve in higher education by embracing the Open Access movement (b) identify next steps and actions that could be taken to improve institutional use of Open Access materials, including Open Educational Resources, (c) examine the implications of such actions for Open Distance Learning and generally the higher education sector. Our investigation highlighted some opportunities and the findings resulted into some clear recommendations that emerged from our investigation both for practitioners and for students in this area. There seems to be a clear synergy between the different but related movements of Open access and OERs as both have to address issues of ease of access, quality and visibility in order to become accepted in higher education.

Abstract:
Abstract: The adoption of enabling technologies by universities provides unprecedented opportunities for flipping the classroom to achieve student&#8209;centred learning. While higher education policies focus on placing students at the heart of the education process, the propensity for student identities to shift from partners in learning to consumers of education provides challenges for negotiating the learning experience. Higher education institutions (HEIs) are grappling with the disruptive potential of technology&#8209;enabled solutions to enhance education provision in cost&#8209;effective ways without placing the student experience at risk. These challenges impact on both academics and their institutions demanding agility and resilience as crucial capabilities for universities endeavouring to keep up with the pace of change, role transitions, and pedagogical imperatives for student&#8209;centred learning. The paper explores strategies for effective change management which can minimise risk factors in adopting the disruptive pedagogies and enabling technologies associated with â flipping the classroomâ  for transformative learning. It recognises the significance of individual, cultural and strategic shifts as prerequisites and processes for generating and sustaining change. The analysis is informed by the development of a collaborative lifeworld&#8209;led, transprofessional curriculum for health and social work disciplines, which harnesses technology to connect learners to humanising practices and evidence based approaches. Rich data from student questionnaires and staff focus groups is drawn on to highlight individual and organisational benefits and barriers, including student reactions to new and challenging ways of learning; cultural resistance recognised in staff scepticism and uncertainty; and organisational resistance, recognised in lack of timely and responsive provision of technical infrastructure and support.

Abstract:
Abstract: The most important dimension of learning is the content, and an LMS suffices this to a certain extent. The present day LMS are designed to primarily address issues like ease of use, search, content and performance. Many surveys had been conducted to identify the essential features required for the improvement of LMS, which includes flexibility and a user centric approach. These features can suffice the need of all learners, when they have different learning requirements. For a true learning, knowledge should also be delivered along with the domain information. Thus, there is a need to design an architecture for user centric Knowledge Driven Learning Management System. Thus for holistic learning, knowledge enriched teaching skills are required, which can enhance and increase the thinking skills of the learner to a higher level. The current LMS needs an improvement in the direction of knowledge discovery, exploration so that knowledge enriched learning can be provided to the learner.. It can be based on knowledge engineering principles like ontology, semantic relationship between objects, cognitive approach and data mining techniques. In this paper, we are proposing an idea of an enhanced Learning Object (LO) called Knowledge Driven Learning Object, which can be delivered to the user for better learning. We had used a data mining approach, classification to harness and exploit these objects and classify them according to their metadata, thereby strengthening the content of objects delivered through the LMS.

Abstract:
Abstract: Really Simple Syndication (RSS) offers a means for university students to receive timely updates from virtual learning environments. However, despite its utility, only 21% of home students surveyed at a university in Lebanon claim to have ever used the technology. To investigate whether national culture could be an influence on intention to use RSS, the survey was extended to British students in the UK. Using the Technology Adoption Model (TAM) as a research framework, 437 students responded to a questionnaire containing four constructs: behavioural intention to use; attitude towards benefit; perceived usefulness; and perceived ease of use. Principle components analysis and structural equation modelling were used to explore the psychometric qualities and utility of TAM in both contexts. The results show that adoption was significantly higher, but also modest, in the British context at 36%. Configural and metric invariance were fully supported, while scalar and factorial invariance were partially supported. Further analysis shows significant differences between perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use across the two contexts studied. Therefore, it is recommended that faculty demonstrate to students how educational RSS feeds can be used effectively to increase awareness and emphasise usefulness in both contexts.

Abstract:
Abstract: Simpler is better. There are a lot of needs in e&#8209;Learning, and theres often a limit to the time, talent, and money that can be thrown at them individually. Contemporary pedagogy in technology and engineering disciplines, within the higher education context, champion instructional designs that emphasize peer instruction and rich formative feedback. However, it can be challenging to maintain student engagement outside the traditional classroom environment and ensure that students receive feedback in time to help them with ongoing assignments. The use of virtual learning platforms, such as Blackboard Learn, and web feed syndication, using technology such as Rich Site Summaries (RSS), can help overcome such challenges. However, during an initial pilot at an institution in Lebanon, only 21% of students reported making use of both these facilities. In this study, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was used to guide the development of a scale to be used to investigate antecedents to the use of web feeds. The proposed scale was reviewed by 4 experts and piloted with 235 students. The collected data were analysed using structural equation modeling (SEM) technique based on AMOS methods. The results revealed adequate face, content, and construct validity. However, perceived ease of use was not a significant predictor of attitude towards use. Overall, the proposed model achieves acceptable fit and explains for 38% of its variance of which is lower than that of the original TAM. This suggests that aspects of the model may lack criterion validity in the Lebanese context. Consequently, it may be necessary to extend the scale by capturing additional moderators and predictors, such as cultural values and subjective norms. We concluded that the existence of RSS feeds in education improves significantly the content presented by the instructors to the e&#8209;learning user decreasing at the same time the size and access cost.

Sari Mettiäinen
Abstract:
Abstract: The aim of this study was to determine nursing teachers and students attitudes to and experiences of using an electronic assessment and feedback tool in supervision of clinical training. The tool was called eTaitava, and it was developed in Finland.  During the pilot project, the software was used by 12 nursing teacher and 430 nursing students. Nine of the teachers participated in the interviews and survey, and 112 students responded to the survey. The data were mainly analysed with qualitative methods.In the eTaitava web&#8209;based user interface, the teacher constructs questions to map the students learning process, and sets them to be sent on a daily basis. According to the findings, four&#8209;fifths of the students responded to the questions almost daily. They thought the software was easy to use and answering the questions took about 5 minutes a day. Based on the students and teachers experiences, the use of the electronic assessment and feedback tool supported supervision of clinical training. It supported the students target&#8209;oriented learning, supervised the students daily work, and made it visible for the teachers. Responding to the software questions inspired the students cognitive learning, and based on the responses, the teachers noticed which students needed more support and could consequently allocate them more supervision time. Responding also supported the students continuous self&#8209;evaluation, and considering the responses structured the students and teachers final assessment discussion.  By means of the electronic assessment and feedback tool, it is possible to promote learning during clinical training by challenging students to reflect on their learning experiences. Students professional development process can be supported through pedagogically planned conceptual supervision which is integrated into experiential learning during clinical training.The findings of the pilot study were encouraging, indicating that the method is worth further development and potentially useful in supervision in all fields of education.

Problem Based Learning and Authentic Assessment in Digital Pedagogy: Embracing the Role of Collaborative Communities

Abstract:
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to qualitatively examine the relationship between a problem&#8209;based learning context, authentic assessment and the role of community in fostering learning in digital contexts. The authors used Digital Moments to create a meaningful learning environment and build the online class community. They then collaboratively developed assessment strategies and tools with students following problem&#8209;based learning methodologies.  Given that the pace of information is rapid and changing, the authors argue that online learning must occur in a context that embraces these three concepts  1. Students must be empowered through PBL to choose real world tasks to demonstrate their knowledge, 2. Students are allowed to choose the modality to represent that knowledge and participate in designing the tools for assessing that knowledge and 3. They do so in a supportive online community built through the sharing of Digital Moments.  The paper chronicles the interconnection between problem based learning, authentic real world assessment tasks and a supportive online community.  This resulted in developing learner autonomy, improving student engagement and motivation, greater use of meaningful self and peer assessments and shared development of collective knowledge.. Further to this, it builds a foundation from which authentic assessment, student ownership of learning and peer support can occur in an ongoing way as learners make the important shifts in power to owning their learning and becoming problem&#8209;based inquirers in future courses.  As a result, in order to fully embrace the online learning environment, we cannot limit ourselves to simple text based measures of student achievement.  Stepping into this brave new world requires innovation, creativity and tenacity, and the courage to accept that as the nature of knowledge has evolved in the digital landscape, so must our means of assessing it.

Abstract:
Abstract: This paper reports on a study carried out at a University of Technology, South Africa, aimed at identifying the existence of the mathematical knowledge gap and evaluating the intervention designed to bridge the knowledge gap amongst students studying first year mathematics at the Chemical Engineering Extended Curriculum Program (ECP). In this study, a pre&#8209;test was used as a diagnostic test to test incoming Chemical Engineering students, with the aim of identifying the mathematical knowledge gap, and to provide students with support in their starting level of mathematical knowledge and skills. After the diagnostic test, an intervention called the autumn school was organized to provide support to bridge the mathematical knowledge gap identified. A closed Facebook group served as a platform for providing student support after school hours. After the autumn school, a post&#8209;test was administered to measure whether there was an improvement in the knowledge gap. Both quantitative and qualitative methods of collecting data were used in this study. A pre&#8209;test was used to identify the mathematical knowledge gap, while a post&#8209;test was employed to measure whether there was a decrease in the knowledge gap after the intervention. Focus group interviews were carried out with the students to elicit their opinions on whether the intervention was of any help for them.  Students participation on Facebook in terms of student post, post comments and likes and an evaluation of students academic performance in comparison to their Facebook individual participation was also conducted. Quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics, while qualitative data was analysed using inductive strategy. Results showed that all the students in this study had the mathematical knowledge gap as no student in the class scored 50% on the overall pre&#8209;test. Findings further revealed that the intervention played a major role in alleviating the mathematical knowledge gap from some of the students (with 1/3 of the students scoring 50% and above in the post&#8209;test) and no positive correlation between students academic performance on the post&#8209;test and students participation in the Facebook group was noted. We hope that insights generated in this study will be of help to other institutions looking into designing interventions for bridging the knowledge gap. Reasons for lack of improvement in the knowledge gap of 2/3 of the students in this class will be highlighted.

Abstract:
Abstract: Current debates on quality standards in education often look to the levels of an increasingly diverse array of literacies as a measure of that standard. At the same time, while mobile technologies are profoundly changing the way we live, communicate and learn in our everyday lives, relatively little seems to be known about their potential to influence even basic literacy in formal education sites. Examining the use of practical and affordable emerging technologies in many countries worldwide where literacy rates are an issue, seems as yet to have been overlooked. Considering the implication of multiple literacy and communication skills to economic and cultural development and stability in emerging countries and increasingly in developed ones as well, finding immediate answers to challenges in this area is critical. This paper reports on a longitudinal study that examined the power of e&#8209;readers to support change in the literacy habits and ultimately the learning cultures of a group of English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers&#8209;in&#8209;training in Chile. The aim of the study was to determine if access to low&#8209;cost mobile readers and a social&#8209;learning driven, technology&#8209;supported, guided reading program, could reverse their literacy challenges.

Abstract:
Abstract: In 2010 1.1 million pupils took private lessons in Germany, with 25% of all German children by the age of 17 having attended paid private lessons at some point in their school career (Klemm & Klemm, 2010). The high demand for support for learning curricular content led us to consider an integrated solution that speeds up both the design of mobile learning games as well as their implementation and adaption. This paper describes the iterative development of a game development framework for touch&#8209;based mobile learning games. The framework focuses on touch&#8209;controlled interaction due to the fact that in 2014 more than 87% of German teenagers possess a smart phone with touch input (Feierabend, Plankenhorn, Rathgeb, 2014) as well as the possibility to engage in short bursts of learning experiences during their idle time, e.g. when commuting. The framework consists of a conceptual component that specifies five different game modes for casual mobile learning games. The technical part of the framework builds on the Unity game engine and offers an architecture that mirrors the game modes and objects from the conceptual part as well as a layer of service building blocks that cover generic functionality like logging, high score management or social media integration. The development of the framework is iterative and cyclic in that each produced game enriches the framework, which in turn accelerates the prototyping and development of further games. Additionally the games themselves are developed and tested iteratively  both concerning usability/user&#8209;experience and transfer, which is described in this paper. developed game prototype as well as the results of our usability tests.

Learning via Game Design: From Digital to Card Games and Back Again

Authors:

Abstract:
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of making design of digital games accessible to primary school children and their teachers, and we argue for the need of digital games that are easy to alter by young learners. We know from previous research projects that digital games do not enable children to express their creativity at full, in contrast with low&#8209;fidelity prototypes and non&#8209;digital toys (such as card or table top games). Therefore, we propose here a novel approach that serves as a middle ground between digital and traditional table top games, and grants children more freedom to express themselves, articulate their understanding and difficulties both individually and socially. This approach, called card&#8209;based model for digital game design, is an alternative to the current trend of associating programming with digital creativity. A preliminary study was conducted by transposing a digital game into a trading card game, to investigate the potential of the approach: as expected, students participating to the study shifted between playing and design thinking. The card&#8209;based model introduced in this paper works full circle: it enables learners to go from digital games to cards and back. In fact, the card&#8209;centric game architecture that resulted from the study allows a digital game to be reified as trading card&#8209;game, so that learners can re&#8209;design and digitize it to obtain a new a digital game, without programming. The next step is to involve primary schools in more complete evaluations of our new game development approach.

Title:
Scenario Based Education as a Framework for Understanding Students Engagement and Learning in a Project Management Simulation Game
Pages:
pp181&#8209;191
Authors:
Morten Misfeldt
Abstract:
In this paper I describe s how students use a project management simulation game based on an attack&#8209;defense mechanism where two teams of players compete by challenging each other⠒s projects. The project management simulation game is intended to be played by pre&#8209;service construction workers and engineers. The gameplay has two parts: a planning part, where the player make managerial decisions about his construction site, and a challenge part where the player chooses between typical problems to occur on the opponent⠒s construction site. Playing the game involves analyzing both your own and you opponent⠒s building project for weak spots. The intention of the project management simulation game, is to provide students with an increased sensitivity towards the relation between planning and reality in complex construction projects. The project management simulation game can be interpreted both as a competitive game and as a simulation. Both of these views are meaningful and can be seen as supporting learning. Emphasizing the simulation aspect let us explain how students learn by being immersed into a simulated world, where the players identify with specific roles, live out specific situations, and experiment with relevant parameters. Emphasizing the competition game aspect we can see how play and competition allow players to experience intrinsic motivation and engagement, as well as thinking strategically about their choices, and hence put attention towards all the things that can go wrong in construction work. The goal of the paper is to investigate empirically how these two understandings influence game experience and learning outcome. This question is approached by qualitative post&#8209;game interviews about the experienced fun, competition and realism. Specific attention is given to how the understandings of the experience (for instance as a game and as a simulation) is entangled when the students describe their experience. Using the concepts frame and domain it is analyzed how the students conceptualize and make meaning of the particular educational

Abstract:
Abstract: Pervasive gaming is a reality&#8209;based gaming genre originating from alternative theatrical forms in which the performance becomes a part of the players⠒ everyday life. In recent years much research has been done on pervasive gaming (Benford et al. 2005, Cheok et al. 2006, Jegers and Wiberg 2006) and its potential applications towards specific domains. Pervasive games have been effective with regards to advertising (VG 2009), education (Pløhn 2013) and social relationship building (Pløhn and Aalberg 2013). In pervasive games that take place over a long period of time, i.e. days or weeks, an important success criterion is to provide features that support in&#8209;game awareness and increases the pervasiveness of the game according to the players⠒ everyday life. However, given the nature of pervasive games, they also pose challenges when compared to more traditional gaming approaches, namely; 1) How can one make the game pervasive according to the players⠒ everyday life? and 2) How can one support in&#8209;game awareness?. This paper presents a Dynamic Pervasive Storytelling (DPS) approach and describes the design of the pervasive game Nuclear Mayhem (NM), a pervasive game designed to support a Web&#8209;games development course at the Nord&#8209;Trøndelag University College, Norway. NM ran parallel with the course and lasted for nine weeks and needed specific features both to become a part of the players⠒ everyday life and to remind the players about the ongoing game. DPS, as a model, is oriented towards increasing the pervasiveness of the game and supporting a continuous level of player in&#8209;game awareness through the use of real life events (RLE). DPS uses RLE as building blocks both to create the overall game story prior to the start of the game by incorporating elements of current affairs in its design and during the unfolding of the game as a mean to increase the pervasiveness and in&#8209;game awareness of the experience. The paper concludes that DPS is a promising approach for creating a game story which increases the pervasiveness of the game and supports

Abstract:
Abstract: Open online distance learning in higher education has quickly gained popularity, expanded, and evolved, with Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) as the most recent development. New web technologies allow for scalable ways to deliver video lecture content, implement social forums and track student progress in MOOCs. However, we remain limited in our ability to assess complex and open&#8209;ended student assignments. In this paper, we present a study on various forms of assessment and their relationship with the final exam score. In general, the reliability of both the self&#8209;assessments and the peer assessments was high.  Based on low correlations with final exam grades as well as with other assessment forms, we conclude that self&#8209;assessments might not be a valid way to assess students performance in MOOCs. Yet the weekly quizzes and peer assessment significantly explained differences in students final exam scores, with one of the weekly quizzes as the strongest explanatory variable. We suggest that both self&#8209;assessment and peer assessment would better be used as assessment for learning instead of assessment of learning. Future research on MOOCs implies a reconceptualization of education variables, including the role of assessment of students achievements.

Affordances of Educational Learning Technologies in Higher Education Multicultural Environments Multicultural Learning Environments

Authors:
Edilson Arenas
Abstract:
Abstract: A raft of studies have been undertakencluster of research has been conducted in higher education to investigate the action possibilitiesaffordances (action possibilities) and the influence information and communication technologies (ICT) may have onin students learning experiences and outcomes. Such studies have given rise to the implementation of a wide range of educational frameworks with a great deal of empirical evidence on the benefits of using technologies to improve learning. However, these benefits do not appear to have fulfilled higher education expectations for more meaningful and transformative learning experiences. In this paper, I argue that part of the problem is either the content or teachercentric perspective of these frameworks and the need to explore the benefits from a more studentcentric perspective. Learning is contextual, with learners having different abilities to learn and varying preferences for educational technologies with greater potential to facilitate their learning activities. Drawing on an ethnographic study of culturally diverse computing students and teachers within learning environments that blend online and face&#8209;to&#8209;face pedagogies, I argue that, that our understanding of what ICT has to offer for the design and implementation of transformative learning activities is a far more complex issue than is often anticipated, particularly in the design and implementation of learning for computer science programs.

Zwelijongile Gaylard Baleni
Abstract:
Abstract: Online and blended learning have become common educational strategy in higher education. Lecturers have to re&#8209;theorise certain basic concerns of teaching, learning and assessment in non&#8209;traditional environments. These concerns include perceptions such as cogency and trustworthiness of assessment in online environments in relation to serving the intended purposes, as well as understanding how formative assessment operates within online learning environment. Of importance also is the issue of how formative assessment benefits both the student learning and teaching within pedagogical strategies in an online context. This papers concern is how online formative assessment provides teaching and learning as well as how lecturers and students benefit from it. A mixed method questionnaire on formative assessment with a main focus on how formative assessment within online contexts operates was used to collect data from courses using Blackboard. Lecturers and students at a comprehensive university were the population. Various techniques for formative assessment linked with online tools such as discussion forums and objective tests were used. The benefits that were famous comprise improvement of student commitment, faster feedback, enhanced flexibility around time and place of taking the assessment task and importance in the procedure for students and lecturers also benefited with less marking time and saved on administrative costs. The crucial findings are that effective online formative assessment can nurture a student and assessment centred focus through formative feedback and enrich student commitment with valued learning experiences. Ongoing trustworthy assessment tasks and interactive formative feedback were identified as significant features that will deal with intimidations to rationality and trustworthiness within the milieu of online formative assessment.

Abstract: This paper is intended to adds to the emerging dialogue on best practices in teacher education for preparing future teachers to use technology to promote grounded theory&#8209;based practices in their classrooms. In it, I report on an evolving model for such training that resulted from a a longitudinal case study examiningning how changes to teacher trainees identities, learning and teaching practices changed when  they are exposed to the use of a variety of social networking technologies for language learning in the context of their teacher preparation program in a private university in Chile. . The 12&#8209;month classroom&#8209;based case study was conducted at a private university in Chile, using a variety of ethnographic tools . observation, interviews, and online conversation analysis. I investigated how the integration of certain ICTstechnology into their content courses, as opposed to more traditional stand&#8209;alone courses on technology use, mattered both in terms of the way the participants. The approach to technology used mattered both in terms of making a difference in the ways that these pre&#8209;service teachers viewed themselves as learners and as future teachers of language, as well as of their evolving perspectives on the use of technology for learning and teaching. My aim in conducting the study was twofold: 1) to determine  was twofold. First, I examined whether innovative technology&#8209; infused (TI) courses would serve to enable the beginning teacher participants to shed their traditional, passive, rather narrow cultural mindset as individuals and learners that are contrary to the identities of effective, 21st century teachers; and 2). Secondly, I sought to determine  to see whether opportunities for these individuals to use a variety of innovative technologies for their own learning would have an influence on the pedagogies these individualsy themselves employed in their teaching practices. Would technology&#8209;infused courses lead to teaching with technology? While the longitudinal study provided encouraging signs on both accounts within the teacher preparation program, questions remained about whether the model would be supported where it mattered  in real classroom teaching. In this article, I report on follow&#8209;up acknowledging the challenges within classroom&#8209;based research and the complexities involved in social science&#8209;based qualitative and numbers&#8209;based findings that suggest that, generally, the positive changes were not sustained. These findings provide strong support for the need for teacher education models to be tested in real practice. Importantly, they also uncover the essential ingredient for promoting future teachers uptake of effective use of ICTs  collective support from the Teacher Education stakeholder community  research paradigms in drawing generalizable conclusions, the data analysis clearly confirms that there were encouraging signs for both aims for this particular group of pre&#8209;service teachers.  This study should be of interest to all stakeholders in education, most especially those whose responsibility it is and who may struggle with practical strategies to ensure that pre&#8209;service teachers have the identities, skills and tools necessary for providing quality 21st century education programs.

Abstract:
Abstract: A range of issues have emerged through the design of a MOOC project known as Gateway MBA.  The Gateway MBA Project aims to extend the MBA Programme at Northampton Business School and this MOOC has a number of intentions.  From a pedagogical perspective the MOOC was created to give the student insight into the demands of postgraduate study while introducing a core area of the MBA, Critical Issues in Business.  Evidence suggests that MOOCs are being used as a strategic tool to explore alternative models of course delivery (Allen & Seaman, 2013) and in this instance the MOOC aims to increase recruitment to the MBA internationally and to raise the profile of the university.  While there are risks in this strategy, the Gateway project team see a potential to introduce and market the MBA to a global audience through open online learning, raising the university brand profile and expanding the eLearning horizons of those involved in the project and beyond. This paper will consider recurring themes in the literature in the context of the design and delivery of the Gateway MBA.  It is clear that reconciling MOOC values and aims with educational quality and learner satisfaction standards is problematic so this paper considers how we developed and embed innovations in the areas of technology and academic cultural practices in order to meet this challenge. Finally we will consider the issues and challenges in the design and delivery of a MOOC and will offer future considerations for sustainability.Evidence suggests that MOOCs are being used as a strategic tool to explore alternative models of course delivery (Allen & Seaman, 2013) and this paper shares insight into an example of such innovation for Business School Education. Gateway MBA draws on examples of open learning worldwide to create a MOOC to extend the MBA distance learning programme for Northampton Business School.  The Gateway MOOC offers open online access to MBA education to develop recruitment to the MBA internationally and to raise the profile of the university.  While there are risks

Abstract:
Abstract: In this study Higher Education teachers were offered new mobile devices with very few conditions attached. The aim was to introduce staff to mobile technology and how it could be used to support teaching and learning within a small, interdisciplinary campus. The study hypothesized that by offering staff the simple incentive of new mobile devices for professional and private use, they will be keener to adopt new practices. The only conditions required were the adoption of two items of software  SharePoint as a file repository, and the VLE providers mobile learning application which provides access to the VLE for both learners and staff. There were three stages to the project; Stage 1 involved presenting staff the results of student feedback from their own courses, where the students set out their preferences for using learning technologies. Stage 2 involved surveying staff opinions on the impact of the mobile devices once they were issued. Stage 3 followed up with a selection of interviews, focussing on concepts of interest gained from the questionnaires. Overall results from this study suggested there was an undeniable enthusiasm amongst teaching staff for using mobile technology, however there were still issues surrounding digital confidence and the pedagogical reasoning for integrating such technologies. There is still a divide on the role of mobile technologies within the classroom, most likely stemmed from the lack of knowledge surrounding their potential purpose. In conclusion, staff enthusiasm alone is not enough to result in adoption and integration of mobile technology within teaching and learning, there must be a focus on pedagogy and relevance for teaching staff to engage fully.

The Scoring of Matching Questions Tests: A Closer Look

Abstract:
Abstract: Electronic testing has become a regular part of online courses. Most learning management systems offer a wide range of tools that can be used in electronic tests. With respect to time demands, the most efficient tools are those that allow automatic assessment. The presented paper focuses on one of these tools: matching questions in which one question can be paired with multiple response terms. The aim of the paper is to identify how the types of questions used in a test can affect student results on such tests expressed as test scores. The authors focus mainly on the issue of the possible increase in scores that can occur with the use of closed questions, when students, after selecting the answers to the questions they know the correct answers to, then guess the answers to the remaining questions (see Diamond and Evans, 1973, Ebel and Frisbie, 1986, Albanese, 1986). The authors show how the number of distractors (unused answers) included in a question influences the overall test score. The data on multiple&#8209;choice and alternative&#8209; response tests are well&#8209;known. But not much is known about matching questions. Estimating formula scores for matching&#8209;question tests is important for determining the threshold at which students demonstrate they possess the required level of knowledge. Here the authors will compare the scores obtained for three types of closed questions: multiple choice, alternative response and matching questions. The analysis of matching assignments in this paper demonstrates that they are a useful tool for testing skills. However, this holds only if the assignment has at least two distractors. Then the informational value of this type of assignment is higher than that of multiple&#8209;choice assignments with three distractors. The results currently indicate that these types of assignment are not useful if the objective of the testing is to rank students or to distinguish between very good students  and this applies even if two distractors are used. In the case of such an objective, it is better to use multiple&#8209;choice assignments.

Abstract:
Abstract A structured search of library databases revealed that research examining the effectiveness of e&#8209;Learning has heavily increased within the last five years. After taking a closer look at the search results, the authors discovered that previous researchers defined and investigated effectiveness in multiple ways. At the same time, learning and development professionals within public and private organisations are increasingly being asked to prove the effectiveness of their learning and development initiatives. This paper investigates the effectiveness of e&#8209;Learning through an integrative review, which ). The paper answers the following research questions: How is the effectiveness of e&#8209;Learning defined? How is the effectiveness of e&#8209;Learning measured? What makes e&#8209;Learning solutions effective? The authors discovered 19 distinct ways to define effectiveness, the most common of which is  learning outcome , appearing in 41 % of the articles examined in the literature review. Moreover, the most common way to measure effectiveness is quantitatively with pre&#8209; and post&#8209;tests. This paper includes an empirical study of an e&#8209;Learning solution for science teachers (K 12) which serves as a valuable addition to the findings of the literature study. The study suggests that it is difficult to use e&#8209;Learning to improve teaching performance, as participating teachers can apply several strategies to avoid substantially changing their work&#8209;related practices. Furthermore, the study shows that only using the fulfilment of pre&#8209;defined learning objectives as an effectiveness parameter does not allow developers and researchers to see unexpected and unintended changes in practice that occur as a result of the e&#8209;Learning program. Finally, the research provides insight into the validity of self&#8209;assessments, suggesting that participants are able to successfully report their own practices, provided certain qualitative survey approaches are used. In this paper, a model for understanding the relationships of the key factors that influence effectiveness is developed. Th

Abstract:
Abstract: The present paper is based on two empirical research studies. The Netbook 1:1 project (2009⠍2012), funded by the municipality of Gentofte and Microsoft Denmark, is complete, while Students⠒ digital production and students as learning designers (2013⠍2015), funded by the Danish Ministry of Education, is ongoing. Both projects concern primary and lower secondary school and focus on learning design frameworks that involve students⠒ agency and participation regarding digital production in different subjects and cross&#8209;disciplinary projects. Within these teacher&#8209;designed frameworks, the students perform as learning designers of learning objects aimed at other students. Netbook 1:1 has shown that digital and multimodal production especially facilitates student&#8209;learning processes and qualifies student&#8209;learning results when executed within a teacher&#8209;designed framework, which provides space for and empowers students⠒ agency as learning designers. Moreover, the positive impact increases when students as learning designers participate in formative evaluation practices. Traditionally, the Danish school has worked hard to teach students to verbalise their own academic competencies. However, as our everyday environment becomes increasingly complex with digital and multimodal technologies, formative evaluation as a learning practice becomes central, requiring the students to develop a digital and multimodal literacy beyond the traditional, language&#8209;centred type. In order to clarify these practices, we address the various understandings of evaluation and assessment that may blur our arguments. Students⠒ digital production and students as learning designers is a large&#8209;scale project that follows up on the findings of Netbook 1:1. It experiments further with various evaluation practices in a digitalised learning environment that focuses on different phases of the learning processes and includes feed&#8209;forward and feedback processes. Evaluation as a learning practice in a digitalised learning context focuses on students as actors, addressing their s

Abstract:
Abstract : Social networking sites (SNSs) have become a major form of communication in todays day and age whereby language use has been impacted in various areas especially in that of learning and teaching. Young users use literally half their week engaging in SNSs communication, thereby giving rise to a brand of internet slang which is entirely their own. This youth&#8209;speak has gone on to influence other areas of language usage. The questions asked in the survey increased the identification of the linguistic features such as the frequency of code switching and erratic spelling and leet, thus expanding the research base. The survey participants, the majority of who are from the Chinese ethnic group had experienced mother tongue interference in their English Language proficiency. The descriptive statistical method was used to analyse the questionnaires, wherein the data collected indicated a rather excessive usage of short messaging texts by almost all respondents owning a mobile device. To authenticate the research findings, an analysis of the text discourses was found to be necessary. The findings proved that the frequent use of short messaging had not majorly affected the English language proficiency of the participants.  In academic writing there was a conscious effort to stay clear of SNSs language. The mushrooming SNSs has helped create a whole young generation who have their own meta&#8209;language, which provides an opportunity to probe to what extent the English language is altered. This research should kick&#8209;start research on how the English language in these areas is used and whether the frequent use of it can develop or weaken proficiency in the language. The results of the present study will definitely enrich the corpus of work conducted on the influence of language of social media and encourage further detailed research in this area.

Abstract:
Abstract: In this paper we propose i&#8209;SERF (integrated&#8209;Self Evaluated and Regulated Framework) an integrated self&#8209;evaluated and regulated framework, which facilitates synchronous and asynchronous education, focusing on teaching and learning in higher education. The i&#8209;SERF framework is a two&#8209;layered framework that takes into account various elements of existing frameworks, introducing though as a new element the means of a self&#8209;evaluation, self&#8209;feeding and regulation mechanism. This mechanism is based on the performance of students, on the students’ answers to appropriately structured questionnaires and on the online monitoring of the supporting platform’s parameters. The outcome derived from a “self&#8209;evaluation” process is then feeding i&#8209;SERF in order to obtain self&#8209;regulation, for the next deployment. In this way, i&#8209;SERF remains alive and progressing. The proposed framework aims to offer the needed background for designing Web 2.0 educational platforms that may exhibit continuous improvement functions, providing in that way considerable benefits to both students and tutors in various fields. A pilot implementation, using an education&#8209;oriented suite with enriched interactive elements supporting a variety of terminal devices, combined with a thorough assessment that utilizes advanced statistical tools has revealed the potentials of the platform to successfully deploy the principles of the i&#8209;SERF framework to yield powerful learning experiences and high quality interactions between students and teachers.

Abstract:
Abstract: This diachronic study describes an innovative university experience consisting of the development of multimedia concept maps (MCM) in relation to social educators and social workers main intervention areas and an active discussion in online forums about the results obtained. These MCMs were prepared by students who attended the Information Technologies and Communication course as part of the Degree in Social Education and dual Degree in Social Education and Work during the academic years 2010&#8209;13 at Pablo Olavide University (Seville&#8209;Spain). Following a methodological framework based on virtual, collaborative action&#8209;research, a qualitative analysis is implemented to analyze 213 MCMs created by students and their interventions in ad hoc online discussion forums with a twofold methodological approach: firstly a qualitative analysis of word frequencies in MCM through the use of Atlas&#8209;Ti software and secondly a forum discussion categorization through a reticular, category based social network analysis using UCINET and yED Graph Editor. Among the most relevant conclusions, we can highlight that a combination of MCMs and discussion forums are highly interactive and collaborative digital resources and are especially beneficial when applied to social studies. Students were able to identify and categorize key areas of social and educational intervention, including: seniors, children, teens and drug dependence, people with disabilities, adults, mental health, socio&#8209;community care, and immigrants.

Abstract:
Abstract: Autism is a disorder in the growth and development of a brain or central nervous system that covers a large spectrum of impairment, symptoms and skills. The children who are suffering from autism face difficulties in communicating and adapting well in the community as they have trouble in understanding what others think and feel. Therefore, there is a need to design effective e&#8209;learning method to ease the communication process and to deliver required knowledge to autistic children. Past researchers have highlighted that a virtual reality based learning environment, a computer simulated environment, can facilitate the learning process among autistic children. It is also recognized that the virtual agent plays an important role in virtual worlds as it eases the communication process between the virtual environment (VE) and children with autism. This research aimed to design an effective learning environment for autistic children by developing a virtual environment prototype using face&#8209;to&#8209;face interviews   and picture exchange communication system (PECS) methodology for data collection which was analysed using quantitative tests. The findings suggest that the toilet virtual environment topped the list for being the most popular learning environment among autistic children for behavioural training. The designed prototype identifies autistic childrens and their parents needs and also addresses limitations in an existing virtual environment.

Abstract:
Abstract: In many K&#8209;12 and higher education contexts, the use of smart mobile devices increasingly affords learning experiences that are situated, authentic and connected. While earlier reviews of mobile technology may have led to criticism of these devices as being largely for consumption, many current uses emphasize creativity and productivity, with diverse purposes ranging from blogging and social networking to near full&#8209;scale video editing, office productivity and language translation. These affordances are further made possible by the large&#8209;scale development of mobile applications (or apps). For the vast majority of mobile device users &#8209; now numbering in the billions ⠍ many of these learning experiences are informal and just&#8209;in&#8209;time, sometimes unplanned, unsanctioned by educational discourse and beyond the immediate locus of institutional control. As smart technologies become increasingly an extension of the personal, educators are faced with the question: how can we best facilitate and explicate the learning process and design relevant experiences that leverage the affordances of so many mobile devices? This paper explores how the effective use of apps enable the learning process to be visualized in ways that support meaningful and student&#8209;centered learning. The authors discuss recent developments in technology, mobile learning and multiliteracies, drawing on a range of case studies deploying mobile devices and using apps as part of learner&#8209;led inquiry processes to enable creativity, collaboration and critical thinking. Emerging from these case studies are real classroom examples, teacher&#8209;student reflections, scaffolds and working models that all speak to the importance of using apps to visualize learning and support learners at each stage of the learning process. Exploring the connections between mobile devices, media literacy and visual literacy, the paper also emphasizes the collaborative affordances of many current apps and the importance of multimodal forms of representation through gesture, voice, text, video and audio.

Abstract:
Abstract. This paper presents the findings of a mixed methods study conducted in the context of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). More specifically, it focuses on the staff development needs of tutors who teach in blended and online environments, the ways HEIs in the United Kingdom (UK) address these needs and institutional issues around the deployment and support of Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) by campus&#8209;based institutions. The informants in both phases of this research were the heads of e&#8209;learning in various UK HEIs. Using an online questionnaire, quantitative data were gathered on the various ways that the staff development needs of the lecturers in blended and online learning have been addressed by UK HEIs. During the second phase of this research, eight semi&#8209;structured interviews were conducted. The findings from both phases are integrated in the results section of the paper.

Abstract:
Abstract: Web resources allow a learner to have more opportunities for study at any time and any place. It is still difficult, however, for learners to choose the right study materials to match their desired learning. A competence&#8209;based system for recommending study materials from the Web (COSREW) is proposed, based on the learners competences. COSREWgenerates a list of learning paths, and extracts search terms from the competence statements on the chosen learning path. Three experiments were conducted to evaluate COSREWs recommendations. The first explored the differences between search engines and the qualities of the study material links in helping learners achieve their competences. The second experiment explored the differences between search keywords, and the third experiment comparedCOSREW with freely&#8209;browsing learning modes. The results showed that the Web is currently not a good resource for a pedagogically informed competence&#8209;based system, since Web pages predominantly comprise text&#8209;based subject matter content with little support for learning competence or capability.

Abstract:
Abstract: Online learning constitutes the most popular distance&#8209;learning method, with flexibility, accessibility, visibility, manageability and availability as its core features. However, current research indicates that its efficacy is not consistent across all learners. This study aimed to modify and extend the factors of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to examine perceived satisfaction of an Arabic sample in online learning. The integrated factors in the modified model includes: deep level (learning styles), surface level (gender), and cognitive (online self&#8209;efficacy) factors. Learning styles were chosen as a central factor. Hence, the online course was purposefully developed to support one pole in each dimension of Felder and Silverman Learning Styles Model (FSLSM) in order to reveal the pedagogical implications of learning styles on learner satisfaction. A total of 70 learners participated voluntarily in the research. At the end of the online course, they were requested to fill in two questionnaires: the Index of Learning Styles (ILS) and a standard questionnaire. The psychometric properties of the latter were firstly analysed to validate the instrument. Then, Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS&#8209;SEM) was conducted to examine the proposed hypotheses. The model achieves an acceptable fit and explains 44.8% of variance. Perceived usefulness represented the best predictor, whereas online self&#8209;efficacy and perceived ease of use failed to show a direct impact on perceived satisfaction. Furthermore, neither learning styles nor gender diversity had direct influence on the dependent factors. Accordingly, the research suggested that other variables may have to be integrated to enhance the power of the model.

Abstract:
Abstract: In 2013, Facebook was used in learning and teaching  clinical problem solving in a Pathology and a Clinical Sciences course delivered at a South Australian university. It involved first&#8209; and second&#8209;year Medical Radiation students and second&#8209;year Nursing students, Of the 152 students enrolled in the Pathology course, there were 148 students who participated in the Facebook group. Of the 148 students, 61 (41%) completed the invited post&#8209;intervention questionnaire. At the same time, all 17 nursing students enrolled in a science course at the regional campus of the same university participated in the Facebook initiative, however, only 10 (59%) completed the post&#8209;intervention questionnaire. A good practice  and checklist were developed from the post&#8209;intervention evaluations, which consisted of 25 Likert&#8209; and open&#8209;type questions. Both student cohorts found the use of Facebook beneficial for them in terms of providing an innovative way of learning; fostering greater interaction amongst co&#8209;students and staff; and effectively engaging them with the content of courses. The importance of clear communication of goals and objectives to students was identified from student comments. Six good practice principles were identified relating to: goals and objectives, expectations, communication, engagement with the course content, active participation, and learning environment.

Abstract:
Abstract: In understanding how active and blended learning approaches with learning technologies engagement in undergraduate education, current research models tend to undermine the effect of learners variations, particularly regarding their styles and approaches to learning, on intention and use of learning technologies. This study contributes to further examine a working model for learning outcomes in higher education with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) on SRS adoption attitude, and the Study Process Questionnaire (SPQ) on students approach to learning. Adopting a cross&#8209;section observational design, the current study featured an online survey incorporating items UTAUT and SPQ. The survey was administered to 1627 undergraduate students at a large comprehensive university in Hong Kong. Relationships between SRS adoption attitude, learning approaches, and learning outcomes in higher&#8209;order thinking & learning and collaborative learning were analyzed with a structural equation model (SEM). A total of 3 latent factors, including four factors from UTAUT in Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, and Deep Learning Approach from the SPQ, were identified in the structural model on students intention to adopt SRS in classes. Current results suggested that a model of active learning outcomes comprising both UTAUT constructs and deep learning approach. Model presented in the present study supported the UTAUT in predicting both behavioral intention and in adopting SRS in large classes of undergraduate education. Specifically, positive attitudes towards SRS use measured with the UTAUT, via a learning approach towards deep learning, accounted for variation on high&#8209;impact learning including higher&#8209;order thinking and collaborative learning. Results demonstrated that the process of technology adoption should be conceptualized in conjunction with learners diversity for explaining variation in adoption of technologies in the higher education context.

Abstract:
Abstract: Courses in virtual learning environments can leave recently enrolled participants in a state of loneliness, confusion and boredom. . What course content is essential in the course, where can more information be found and which assignments are mandatory? Research has stated that learner control and motivation are crucial issues for successful online education. This paper presents and discusses visualisation as a channel to improve learners control and understanding of programming concepts and gamification as a way to increase study motivation in virtual learning environments. Data has been collected by evaluation questionnaires and group discussions in two courses partly given in the Moodle virtual learning environment. One course is on Game based learning for Bachelors programmes, the other is a course on e&#8209;learning for university teachers. Both the courses have used progress bars to visualise students study paths and digital badges for gamification. Results have also been discussed with teachers and pedagogues at a department for computer and systems sciences. Furthermore, two visualisation prototypes have been designed, developed and evaluated in programming lectures. Findings indicate that visualisation by progress bars is a good way to improve course participants overview in online environments with rich and multifaceted content. To what degree the visualisation facilitates the course completion is hard to estimate, and like students have different learning styles, they also seem to have different visualisation needs. Gamification by digital badges seems to have various motivational impacts in different study groups and in traditional university programmes the traditional grades seem to be the main carrots. Finally, it seems that software visualisation might be a promising path to enhance programming education in the 21st century.

Abstract:
Abstract: Online continuing education (CE) holds promise as an effective method for rapid dissemination of emerging evidence&#8209;based practices in health care. Yet, the field of CE continues to develop and delivery is predominately face&#8209;to&#8209;face programs. Practice&#8209;oriented online educational methods and e&#8209;learning platforms are not fully utilized. Educational theorists suggest an experiential approach to CE consistent with adult learning theory. A compelling question remains: Can online asynchronous CE programming prepare health care providers in delivering higher&#8209;level practice competencies?. To address this question, the authors have identified seven composite ⠜sticky⠀ factors that have been critical to the engagement of learners and the creation and delivery of practice&#8209;oriented online educational programs (Zaghab et al, 2015). The sticky factors are based in knowledge management (Nonaka, 1994; Szulanski, 2002) and adult education or andragogy (Knowles, 1970; 1984). In this paper, sticky factors are mapped to Moore and colleagues⠒ (2009) higher level learning outcomes in health care CE. Data are presented on learner reported practice&#8209;related outcomes in a selection of online CE courses on the CIPS Knowledge Enterprise⌢ portal with the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy⠒s Center for Innovative Pharmacy Solutions (CIPS). A dynamic, adaptive e&#8209;learning environment built by technology partner, Connect for Education, Inc., provides the innovative platform and the Acclaim! interactive learning technology. This technology&#8209;instructional partnership is dedicated to an iterative continuous improvement process called the Learner Stewardship Cycle (Zaghab et al, 2015). The cycle improves stickiness and learner engagement in order to achieve higher&#8209;level learning outcomes in CE. Findings suggest that of the 769 learners successfully completing an online course with two or more sticky design segments, the majority report reaching level 4, 5 and 6 learning competencies.

Abstract:
Abstract: Quality education is undoubtedly a global concern, tied closely to preoccupations with economic and social development. Increasingly, the adoption and effective use of current technology tools are being recognized as visible signs of that quality. Scholars are providing increasing evidence of the kinds of empowered teacher identities that will adopt the effective use of technology tools in teaching. Less is being discussed about how technology can support the processes needed to mediate such identities. The context of Teacher Education is a strategic place to begin to initiate such processes. Our aim in this article is twofold:  1) to describe two recent examples of innovative, technology  supported mentoring processes that were conducted in the context of an EFL Teacher Education program in Chile; 2) to revisit the findings in light of new evidence from participants who have moved on in their careers and in the framework of recent scholarship on the responsibilities that Teacher Education plays in their development. The first 16&#8209;month study examined the influences of a guided reading program involving e&#8209;readers on the identities and literacy skills of pre&#8209;service teachers. The second was a student&#8209;conceived study to determine the influence of upper year students peer mentoring, made available partly through a social media site (SMS), on the identities and investment in learning of 12 first&#8209;year students in the pedagogy program. Initial evidence from ethnographic tools indicated in both studies that the participants were struggling with confidence and doubting themselves as knowledgeable, effective future teachers  not indicative of quality teaching. Positive signs at the end of both studies and more recent reports from participants suggest that the mentoring had longitudinal benefits for some, although not uniformly.  The potential of apprenticeship and mentoring in a technology&#8209; supported environment requires rethinking of Teacher Education mandates if we are to empower emerging teachers to be quality teachers.

Abstract:
Abstract: This article describes a small&#8209;scale study that explored the relationship between the pedagogical practices characterised as open and the existing model of undergraduate teaching and learning at a large research&#8209;intensive university (RIU). The aim was to determine the factors that might enable (conversely impede) the greater uptake of open educational resources (OER) in universities of this type. The research was informed by two theoretical frameworks. The first was derived from the literature on open educational practice and served as the basis for an interview schedule. The second was derived from the literature on RIUs and provided a structure for reflecting on the data in three areas of activity: pedagogy, outreach and governance. The researchers conducted semi&#8209;structured interviews with 14 academics, selected either for their involvement in open practices or for the recognition they had received for excellence in their teaching. The interview schedule was derived from a literature survey focusing on open pedagogic models. Topics discussed with interviewees included the flattening of the teacher&#8209;student relationship, students assumption of responsibility for their own learning, learning as (or in) a community and the possible influence of open practices in research on teaching. Findings suggest that open educational approaches can be accommodated in a universitys prevailing pedagogic model without compromising its integrity. However, openness can enhance the specifics of that pedagogy; for example, through aligning research&#8209;informed teaching with emergent open practices in research and equipping students with the skills necessary for living and working in an open world. There is a closer alignment between releasing OER and an RIUs strategic mission for outreach. Nevertheless, the spread of open practices in both pedagogy and outreach hinges on issues of governance, which in RIUs is characterised by considerable emphasis on the autonomy of individual academics.

Abstract:
Abstract: Student's emotional aspects are often discussed in order to promote better learning activity in blended learning courses. To observe these factors, course participant's self efficacy and reflections upon their studies were surveyed, in addition to the surveying of the metrics of student's characteristics during a Bachelor level credit course. Regarding the causal relationships between these factors, the contributions of the factors of self efficacy and other characteristics were evaluated. The contents of notes students took during the course were lexically evaluated to determine whether this activity promoted reflection. Four indices of note&#8209;taking activities were extracted from the lexical analysis. Correlation analysis was conducted, and according to the provisional results of the correlation analysis between the four indices of note&#8209;taking and student's characteristics of their own degree of self efficacy, there were some significant relationships between note&#8209;taking indices and some of the self assessment indices, such as word rates in notes and the degree of out of course study, and between the content coverage of notes taken and self understanding.

Bring Your Own Device to Secondary School: The Perceptions of Teachers, Students and Parents

Abstract:
Abstract: This paper reports on the first two years of a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) initiative in a New Zealand secondary school, using data derived from a series of surveys of teachers, parents and students, who are the main stakeholders in the transformation to a BYOD school. In this paper we analyse data gathered from these surveys, which consists primarily of qualitative data from free text questions, but also includes some quantitative data from structured questions, giving insights into the challenges faced by teachers, students and parents in moving to a BYOD classroom, and the potential benefits for teaching and learning, and preparing students for a digital world. We frame our analysis from a sociocultural perspective that takes account of structures, agency and cultural practices and the interactions between these domains. Thematic analysis was performed by considering these domains from the responses of the three stakeholder groups. We found that there were some tensions in these domain relationships, with contexts and practices having to be renegotiated as the BYOD classroom and the structures within which it operates have evolved. On the surface, it appears that many of the changes to cultural practice are substitution or augmentation of previous activities, for example using one&#8209;to&#8209;one devices for researching and presenting material. However, when we look deeper, it is evident that apparently straightforward adoption of digital media is having a more profound impact on structure and agency within the classroom. While the structural impact of digital infrastructures does raise some concerns from all stakeholders, it is clear that it is the curricular structure that is the most contentious area of debate, given its impact on both agency and cultural practice. While the majority of respondents reported positive changes in classroom management and learning, there were nevertheless some concerns about the radical nature of the change to BYOD, though very rarely from teachers. If there is an area where agency may be most problematic, it i

Copycat or Creative Innovator? Reproduction as a Pedagogical Strategy in Schools

Abstract:
Abstract: This article explores how student behaviour and interactions change when teachers use producing as a primary pedagogical strategy (Papert, 1980; Ejsing&#8209;Duun and Karoff, 2014). Based on observed student and teacher actions and responses, as well as students production, this paper emphasizes the importance of understanding how students explore creativity and playfulness while producing in learning situations. This paper is based on a large research project called Children as Learning Designers in a Digital School (20132015), funded by Denmarks Ministry of Education, which included fieldwork in five Danish public schools, involved about 500 students, and comprised six interventions in the first, second, fifth, sixth, and tenth grades. The projects empirical data consist of observations, participatory observation, and productions students created during the interventions. This paper presents an analysis of how students were creative and playful while producing learning material as games during three of the projects interventions. The study is based on a specific understanding of the creativity with a point of departure (Boden, 2004; Tanggaard and Wegener, 2015) and playfulness (Karoff, 2013) that occur in learning situations. We approach creativity and playfulness as new methods of learning, through six areas of change that inform []how todays kids play and learn, and, more generally, how they see themselves, relate to others, dwell in place, and treat things (Ackermann, 2013: 119). This paper investigates how educators handle childrens productive processes in a school setting and how teachers can conceptualize and nurture play and creativity as drivers for learning. In this context, the importance of skills and acknowledgement of reproducing and re&#8209;mixing existing materials is discussed. We further argue that playfulness is necessary for creativity to occur. From this point of view, it is possible to understand how learning activities can support creativityan essential twenty&#8209;first century skill (Levinsen and Sørensen, 2015).

Abstract:
Abstract: Conventional taught learning practices often experience difficulties in keeping students motivated and engaged. Video games, however, are very successful at sustaining high levels of motivation and engagement through a set of tasks for hours without apparent loss of focus. In addition, gamers solve complex problems within a gaming environment without feeling fatigue or frustration, as they would typically do with a comparable learning task. Based on this notion, the academic community is keen on exploring methods that can deliver deep learner engagement and has shown increased interest in adopting gamification ⠍ the integration of gaming elements, mechanics, and frameworks into non&#8209;game situations and scenarios ⠍ as a means to increase student engagement and improve information retention. Its effectiveness when applied to education has been debatable though, as attempts have generally been restricted to one&#8209;dimensional approaches such as transposing a trivial reward system onto existing teaching materials and/or assessments. Nevertheless, a gamified, multi&#8209;dimensional, problem&#8209;based learning approach can yield improved results even when applied to a very complex and traditionally dry task like the teaching of computer programming, as shown in this paper. The presented quasi&#8209;experimental study used a combination of instructor feedback, real time sequence of scored quizzes, and live coding to deliver a fully interactive learning experience. More specifically, the ⠜Kahoot!⠀ Classroom Response System (CRS), the classroom version of the TV game show ⠜Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?⠀, and Codecademy⠒s interactive platform formed the basis for a learning model which was applied to an entry&#8209;level Python programming course. Students were thus allowed to experience multiple interlocking methods similar to those commonly found in a top quality game experience. To assess gamification⠒s impact on learning, empirical data from the gamified group were compared to those from a control group who was taught through a traditional learning app

Exploring Media Literacy and Computational Thinking: A Game Maker Curriculum Study

Abstract:
Abstract: While advances in game&#8209;based learning are already transforming educative practices globally, with tech giants like Microsoft, Apple and Google taking notice and investing in educational game initiatives, there is a concurrent and critically important development that focuses on  game construction  pedagogy as a vehicle for enhancing computational literacy in middle and high school students. Essentially, game construction&#8209;based curriculum takes the central question  do children learn from playing games  to the next stage by asking  (what) can children learn from constructing games?  Founded on Seymour Papert s constructionist learning model, and developed over nearly two decades, there is compelling evidence that game construction can increase student confidence and build their capacity towards ongoing computing science involvement and other STEM subjects. Our study adds to the growing body of literature on school&#8209;based game construction through comprehensive empirical methodology and evidence&#8209;based guidelines for curriculum design. There is still debate as to the utility of different software tools for game construction, models of scaffolding knowledge, and evaluation of learning outcomes and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we present a study we conducted in a classroom environment with three groups of grade 6 students (60+ students) using Game Maker to construct their own games. Based on a quantitative analysis and a qualitative discussion we organize results around several core themes that speak to the field of inquiry: levels of computational literacy based on pre&#8209; and post&#8209;tests; gender&#8209;based attitutdes to computing science and programming based on a pre&#8209; and post&#8209;survey; and the relationship between existing media literacy and performance in programming as part of the game construction curriculum. Significant results include some gender differences in attitudes towards computers and programming with boys demonstrating slightly higher confidence and performance. We discuss the complex reasons potentially contributing

Abstract:
Abstract: The task of integrating games into an educational setting is a demanding one, and integrating games as a harmonious part of a bigger ecosystem of learning requires teachers to orchestrate a myriad of complex organizational resources. Historically, research on digital game&#8209;based learning has focused heavily on the coupling between game designs, previously established learning principles, student engagement, and learning outcomes much to the expense of understanding how games function in their intended educational contexts and how they impact the working processes of teachers. Given the significant investments of time and resources teachers need to make in order to conduct game&#8209;based learning activities, the foci of past research is problematic as it obfuscates some of the pressing realities that highly affect games viability as tools for teaching and learning. This paper aims to highlight the demands that the implementation and use of an educational game in formal educational settings puts on teachers working processes and skillsets. The paper is based on two case studies in which a researcher collaborated with K&#8209;12 teachers to use MinecraftEdu (TeacherGaming LLC, 2012) as a classroom activity over a five&#8209;month long period. By documenting both the working processes involved in implementing the game into the classroom environment, as well as the execution of the actual game&#8209;based classroom activities, the studies identified a wide variety roles that a teacher needs to take on if they are to make games a central part of a school curriculum. Ultimately, the paper highlights the importance of understanding the constraints under which teachers work, and argues that a better understanding of the contexts in which games are to be used, and the roles teachers play during game&#8209;based learning scenarios, is a necessary foundation for improving games viability as educational tools.

Abstract:
Abstract: E&#8209;Learning Sudan (ELS) is a custom&#8209;built computer/tablet game that provides alternative learning opportunities to Sudanese children who are excluded from education. Unique in ELS is that children can learn mathematics, in their own remote village, without a teacher. This research study assessed the effectiveness of ELS in two pilots through a pretestposttest control group quasi&#8209;experimental design. In Pilot I, 67 children in three remote villages, aged used the game for a period of six weeks, five days a week, 45 minutes a day; the control group did not receive any education.. In Pilot II, 591 children in 19 remote villages, played the game for six months, for a maximum of five times a week, 45 minutes a day; the control group received informal education in out&#8209;of&#8209;school centers. The results of the analysis on the pretestposttest data revealed that ELS increased mathematics knowledge acquisition in numeracy and adding significantly and maintained student motivation to learn. Analyses of control group data and EGMA (internationally validates Early Grade Mathematics Assessment) showed that the children in the experimental group learned more than children who received no education at all, informal or formal education. These findings suggest that the implementation of ELS can greatly benefit learning for out&#8209;of&#8209;school children like in Sudan.

The Effects of Instructor Control of Online Learning Environments on Satisfaction and Perceived Learning

Abstract:
Abstract: Instructional design is important as it helps set the discourse, context, and content of learning in an online environment. Specific instructional design decisions do not only play a part in the discourse of the learners, but they can affect the learners levels of satisfaction and perceived learning as well. Numerous studies have shown the value that both student satisfaction and learning have on learner achievement. For this reason, the question of whether instructors can impact satisfaction and perceived learning through various instructional design decisions is important. This study looked at broad&#8209;based instructor decisions to see if online environments with higher levels of instructor control lead to higher levels of student satisfaction and/or perceived learning. Three different online environments were used, with each one containing progressively more instructor control. The results show that there were no significant differences in regards to mean levels of satisfaction between the three environments. However, there were significant differences among mean levels of perceived learning based on the differing instructor&#8209;controlled environments. This study shows that increasing the levels of instructor control within online environments leads to an increase in perceived learning.

Abstract:
Abstract: This paper explores the design of a blended learning environment in a transition from face&#8209;to&#8209;face and seeks to determine whether learner characteristics and background together with blended learning design elements are significant factors for learning outcomes such as intrinsic motivation, satisfaction, knowledge construction and learning performance in blended learning. It is aimed at examining the learner characteristics and backgrounds such as age, gender, self&#8209;regulation, attitudes, family and social support as well as the management of workload in blended learning. It is again to find out the levels of use and satisfaction with blended learning design features such as interactions, learning management system tools and resources, face&#8209;to&#8209;face support and technology quality by learners. Students from three schools and one directorate were involved in a face&#8209;to&#8209;face set up in the first part of a seventeen week semester and in an online set up in the second part. They finally had a face&#8209;to&#8209;face at the end to review their work after which they took end of semester examinations. A questionnaire survey was administered to 270 respondents in this group to gather data on student characteristics and background, design features and three of the outcomes. The examination results were used as a measure of the performance variable in the learning outcomes. We applied the online self&#8209;regulated learning questionnaire for data on students self&#8209;regulation, the intrinsic motivation inventory for data on motivation and other self&#8209;developed instruments to measure the other constructs. Descriptive statistics showed that the identified learner characteristics manifest strength for blended learning design and the learners involvement with design features was found to be high and satisfactory. ANOVA results showed no significant differences between age groups in performance and t&#8209;test results showed no significant differences between male and female students. Regression analysis results showed learner attitudes as predictors of learner satisfaction and motivation while workload management is a significant predictor for learner satisfaction and knowledge construction. Among the design elements, regression results showed only learner interactions as significant predictors of knowledge construction and satisfaction. As a consequence, a number of learner characteristics and design features are seen to be important for blended learning design and the non&#8209;significant ones remain a focus for future research.

Abstract:
Abstract: Formative feedback has great potential for teaching and learning in online undergraduate programmes. There is  a large number of courses where the main source of feedback  is provided by the instructor.  This is particularly seen in subjects where assessments are designed based on specific activities which are the same for all students, and where the assessment is performed by the instructor, not by a peer. Additionally, in introductory or basically procedural courses, there is often a need for instructor feedback, as opposed to peer&#8209;feedback, as it demands high quality feedback both in the content and in the process in order not to mislead students. Therefore personalized feedback provided by instructor is an academic demand in the current educational models that have positioned the student at the center of the learning process. However in the present context of high student&#8209;staff ratio, it is not easy to extend the use of individual comments delivered by instructors among the academic community. This article focuses on the virtual higher education environment given its present and future potential as well as the amount of queries currently surrounding it. Literature on formative feedback in higher education has been reviewed for the period 2000 to 2014, in order to find answers as to which aspects are relevant to efficiently implement personalized feedback prepared by the teacher.Findings show that effective personalized feedback in an virtual environment requires a three&#8209;dimensional analysis: from the student perspective, from the instructor one and from the media perspective (written text, video recording or audio recording) , in order  to find shared aspects that contribute to the enhancement in the use of personalized feedback performed by faculty.

Abstract:
Abstract: Online learning is becoming more attractive to perspective students because it offers them greater accessibility, convenience and flexibility to study at a reduced cost. While these benefits may attract prospective learners to embark on an online learning environment there remains little empirical evidence relating the skills and traits of knowledge acquisition with a synchronous online environment supported by Blackboard Collaborate. Without understanding this relationship colleges and universities cannot assess if their programs offered through educational communication technologies, such as Blackboard, enhance learner⠒s skills and traits that are essential for knowledge acquisition.  The purpose of this paper is to (i) examine the relationship between an online learning environment, which is supported by Blackboard Collaborate, and the skills and traits of knowledge acquisition, (ii) assess the influence of online learners motivation on knowledge acquisition skills and traits, and (iii) propose alternative Blackboard Collaborate layout and structure derived from the process of a critical reflection. Data was collected from 84 learners who studied online courses in a Higher Education Institution in the United Arab Emirates.  The Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) was employed to perform the path analysis and SPSS was used to determine the factor structure of the examined variables. The study revealed three major findings. First, easy access of the Blackboard Collaborate and an effectively designed structure enhanced learners⠒ problem understanding and communication. It also improved the personal traits of conceptualisation, tolerance and amiability that are essential for knowledge acquisition. Second, the readiness of the online learners with educational communication technologies had a positive influence on their liberal arts knowledge. Third, learners⠒ attested motivation to embark on synchronous online classes enhanced their knowledge acquisition skills and traits. Finally, alternative Blackboard Collaborate layouts and struc

Abstract:
Abstract: This paper presents a case study of using blended learning to enhance students language skills and learner autonomy in an Asian university environment. Blended learning represents an educational environment for much of the world where computers and the Internet are readily available. It combines self&#8209;study with valuable face&#8209;to&#8209;face interaction with a teacher. This study puts the spotlight on learning outcomes in an English for Specific Purposes (ESP) class in Thailand in which e&#8209;learning strategies are used in parallel with traditional classroom language teaching methods of the four language learning skills. These skills are listening, speaking, reading and writing. The achievements and attitudes of students were compared between the control group and the experimental group to measure the potential of available technology to develop language skills and learner autonomy. The findings from this study show that online practice is directly beneficial to enhance the four language learning skills as well as autonomous learning and learner motivation.

Universities and institutions of higher education are facing economic pressures to sustain large classes, while simultaneously maintaining the quality of the online learning environment (Deming et al, 2015).. Digital learning environments require significant pedagogical shifts on the part of the teacher. This paper is a qualitative examination of the nature of teaching in the digital age, and the significant changes facing teachers in the 21C. The authors describe key features of quality distance pedagogy that were exhibited during 12 weeks of a synchronous undergraduate course held in Adobe Connect. The central research questions are 1. How can problem&#8209;based learning pedagogy enable instructors to form smaller cohesive groups of students that take greater responsibility for their own learning? 2. What strategies can be used by teachers to develop communities of practice and inquiry?  3. How can an instructor in a large virtual class co&#8209;create the level of social capital that is required to build and maintain the relationships that are a necessary condition for a high quality learning experience? and 4. What are the perceptions of teachers about the challenges and benefits of facilitating a high quality problem based learning environment through invisible pedagogy?The research is grounded in literature through the work of Cousins and Bissar (2012), Kaufman (2013), Badge, Saunders and Cann (2012), Flavin (2012) and McNeill, Gosper and Xu (2012). These authors examine how teachers and learners adapt to the digital age. In addition, more recent work by Bowers and Kumar (2015), Hoadley (2016), Deming et al (2015) and Gunduz et al (2016) are examined.In these digital spaces, teachers become facilitators, guides, collaborators and learners themselves, thus making traditional pedagogy virtually invisible.Further, the paper uses qualitative semi&#8209;structured interviews of two assistant professors who instructed the two groups of undergraduate students The teachers identify challenges and successes to using problem based learning as a tool for attaining 21C learning outcomes in digital learning spaces.

Abstract:
The 21st century marks the beginning of digital age with the extensive use of digital media, mobile devices, and Internet resources. Recent studies found that this digital era has expanded the landscape of student experiences, and educational technologies as well as increased the educator’s awareness on embracing technologies to promote effective learning. This has redefined the meaning of effective learning and the approaches in motivating students. Therefore, redesigning the learning environments plays an important role in enhancing the students’ experiences in the university classrooms. In this study, the 21st century class environment is designed by mapping Jonassen’s model and Gagne’s events to employ the constructivist learning approach, organize the information processing, and design the instructions to support effective learning. In order to study student’s perception in the 21st century class environment, this study employed the mixed methods approach, includes conducting exploratory factor analysis on the questionnaire response and the qualitative analysis on students’ comments. The research samples were formed by 300 undergraduate degree students who studied at INTI International University, Malaysia. The exploratory factor analysis has identified four main factors, group learning, motivation, skills development and knowledge transfer. In the discussion, this study presents the key attributes, the main contributors to the attributes and its impact on student learning. For instance, the factor of group learning can be stimulated by emphasizing on the identified key attributes, such as improved work relationship, improved leadership, and refined collaborative learning which enhancing student learning experience as they are keen to attempt different approach, and anticipate changes. This study aims to identify the factors and elaborate the key attributes for supporting the strategies in transforming the university class environment to enhances students’ learning experiences and promote effective learning.

Abstract:
This study is an Information and Computer Technology evaluation of the Blackboard Learning Management System into teaching and learning at an institution of higher education in South Africa. In view of the institution’s objective of developing a context&#8209;driven, transformative, and innovative teaching and learning practices involving the integration of technology, the study sought to classify and evaluate the form and function of teaching and learning innovations on Blackboard. Using a case study research design and a purposive sampling strategy, lecturers making an extensive use of Blackboard in the delivery of their courses were sampled. Blackboard start&#8209;up documents as well as open&#8209;ended questionnaires for lecturers provided qualitative data. Content analysis and the extraction of themes were employed.  The functional pedagogical framework and SAMR models were used as interpretive lenses for the findings. The study concludes that the nature of Blackboard innovations tended to be more superficial at the levels of substitution and augmentation. Limited transformation evidenced by modification and redefinition spelled lack of substantial changes in curriculum design and delivery. With respect to the functions served by Blackboard, the conclusion drawn is that the integration is to a large extent driven by management and efficiency concerns and less by interaction, collaboration and personalisation functions. The study signals non&#8209;realisation of the educational functions spelt in the Blackboard start&#8209;up documents. The study recommends a differentiated approach to Blackboard training by a multi&#8209;disciplinary team.

Abstract:
In Malaysia, traditional teaching is still a common approach among many lecturers. There have been many studies reported its limitations and many lecturers have started to adopt more learner&#8209;centred teaching approach to promote better learner understanding and learner motivation. Throughout this effort, it is noticed there are lecturers who could not be assured and felt uncertain about this transition because they went through traditional teaching environment during their studies.   Due to this, the effort in shifting from traditional teaching to a more learner&#8209;centred teaching has been challenging and hard&#8209;hitting. Nevertheless, educational and multimedia technology has played an important role in creating a more interesting and engaging learning environments for our digital natives in this 21st century. In this research, a framework is to be proposed based on Weimer’s Learner&#8209;Centred Teaching model and through the incorporation of educational technology and multimedia technology in the learning environments. This proposed framework describes how this learner&#8209;centred teaching environment could promote better learner experiences by increasing retention rate and improving learner motivation. This proposed framework is recommended through the triangulation results from pre&#8209;test/ post&#8209;test, learning environments surveys and students’ written comments, which in turn serves as a guideline for lecturers to identify how they could progressively shift to learner&#8209;centred teaching environment.

Abstract:
This article describes the use of Moodle as a suitable platform to support the postgraduate open and distance learning (ODL) courses offered by Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia (USIM). Many USIM postgraduate students who take obligatory courses (e.g., research methodology and data analysis) are taught at different venues to facilitate students’ access to higher education and enhance quality of lifelong learning. Managing this complex teaching network has called for the adaptation of Moodle platform. This approach meets two relevant requirements, (a) to ensure consistency, compliance, and quality of teaching, (b) to reduce educational costs, which largely depend on the number of peripheral venues for teaching activities. This article analyses the functionalities of the Moodle platform and its use among USIM postgraduate students and academics. The data was collected based on content analysis via questionnaire applied to 18 USIM ODL postgraduate students and 4 lecturers. The results show that despite having great potential, Moodle is mainly used as a repository for materials. Moreover, lecturers recognize the importance of the use of other functionalities of this platform in order to promote the success of the teaching and learning process.

Abstract:
Abstract: This paper describes a two&#8209;spiral action research approach (AR) in its analysis of the experience of a British University endeavouring to change and reposition itself in the context of fast pace external change in terms of innovation.  Taking the European Union (EU) 2020 digital competence framework (Ferrari 2013), with its drive to address the huge EU digital skills gap as technological adaptation and use speed up and the call from the UK Government, employers, and students themselves to produce digitally competent graduates Higher Institutions need to consider their proposition. An action research  approach, with its reflective stance, is relevant for complex and policy based studies, we argue, as the framework can encompass mixed methods techniques. Informed in conjunction with a ‘Panel of Experts’, thought&#8209;leaders drawn from industry and academia, and incorporating a strong student voice, we believe the AR approach is key to offering insights and transparency in the quest for change. The transition from an initial top&#8209;down management approach to a kaleidoscopic middle&#8209;out partnership of the executive team with key internal stakeholders, including students, academic staff, librarians, learning technologists and IT specialists offers a new and inclusive approach offering the agility and the synergy that traditional models lack. Results indicate that strong research and technological leadership, building internal alliances with key stakeholders, focusing on the ‘middle out’ and a partnership approach to working with the Students Union all contribute to a transformational and shared  approach to institution&#8209;wide change at a time of complexity and contestation in Higher Education policy.

Using a Mixed Methods Research Design in a Study Investigating the ‘Heads of e&#8209;Learning’ Perspective towards Technology Enhanced Learning
Pages:
pp301&#8209;311
Authors:
Timos Almpanis
Abstract:
Abstract: This paper outlines the research design, methodology and methods employed in research conducted in the context of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and focuses on the Heads of e&#8209;Learning (HeLs) perspective about Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) by campus&#8209;based UK institutions. This paper aims to expand on the research design and the research methodology that was followed as part of this research, making a justified argument for mixed methods approaches in e&#8209;learning contexts. The background of this research and its research questions is outlined first to provide the context of this research. Following a review of the literature on TEL that informed this research, this paper provides an explanation of the researcher’s worldview before discussing the chosen research design. The status of the findings and their generalisability based on the chosen methodology are then discussed. The research findings show that most universities represented in the survey offered various staff development opportunities to their academic staff in the effective use of TEL and that examples of innovative use of technology are evident in some areas in all participating institutions. Staff’s digital skills and competencies coupled with a pedagogical underpinning as well as a supportive institutional culture were found to be the enablers for the effective implementation of TEL, according to the HeLs’ expert informed responses. The paper is summarised and concluded making a case for the adoption of Mixed Methods Research (MMR) in e&#8209;learning settings.

Empirical Data and Emerging Power Critiques: Lessons Learned
Pages:
pp312&#8209;321
Authors:
Caroline Stockman
Abstract:
Abstract: This paper evidences the importance of maintaining a dynamic interpretive stance in e&#8209;learning research. In particular, it shows how a rigorous methodology, tailored to the research question, overlooked the importance of power and knowledge in technology acceptance research for education. It was perhaps the affordance of the mixed methods design, explained in this paper, which allowed for a blind spot to come to the surface, and prompt a renegotiation of the data. Empirical studies on the use of technology in education don’t always take the pervasiveness of power dynamics into account. Yet this study shows how direct and effective they are in a teacher’s decision to use or not use a technology. Using Michel Foucault’s theory as an analytical tool, the findings from an original empirical study are re&#8209;examined. The analysis offers a new understanding of the critical manifestations of a performance culture in UK schooling, which goes hand in hand with a culture of observation and accountability. This is further underlined by the authority of time pressures. Both of these go at the cost of pedagogical considerations, which is arguably the primary concern of educators.  That is where a power critique shows it value, but also its necessity. It traces the breaking points of the system; the moment where it undermines the rationality which it uses as its own justification. We correctly motivate our research choices through methodological paradigms and domain loyalties, but including a power critique suggests a new imperative for e&#8209;learning research. It offers the possibility to question normalised forces and better understand technology acceptance in education. We need to consider this critical position in any research design to continue challenging our theorising about e&#8209;learning.

Title:
An exploration of autonetnography as an eResearch methodology to examine learning and teaching scholarship in Networked Learning
Pages:
pp322&#8209;335
Authors:
Lyz Howard
Abstract:
Abstract: As an experienced face&#8209;to&#8209;face teacher, working in a small Crown Dependency with no Higher Education Institute (HEI) to call its own, the subsequent geographical and professional isolation in the context of Networked Learning (NL), as a sub&#8209;set of eLearning, calls for innovative ways in which to develop self&#8209;reliant methods of professional development. Jones and De Laat (2016, p.43) claim that NL is different from other eLearning sub&#8209;sets, for example, Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) and Computer&#8209;Supported&#8209;Collaborative&#8209;Learning (CSCL) because of its “focus on pedagogy and understanding how social relationships (and networked practices) influence learning rather than having a predominantly technical agenda for change in education”. NL, rather than TEL or CSL, therefore, locates the context for this paper. My intent was to develop a bespoke professional development framework to facilitate independent and self&#8209;directed NL teaching development. To scaffold my professional development autonetnography (ANG) was chosen to facilitate my learning. The concept of ANG was introduced by Kozinets & Kedzior (2009) as an autobiographical extension to the ethnographic genre Netnography defined by Kozinets (2006) as an interpretive research methodology to examine online observations and interactions.  Whilst recent researchers of digital learning claim that has potential to add to a growing body of knowledge that accepts the post&#8209;modern use of self as an insider researcher (Ferreira, 2012; Persdotter, 2013; Mkono, Ruhanen & Markwell, 2015) none have explained how to undertake ANG.  There appears here, to be a theory&#8209;practice gap (Kessels and Korthagen, 1996) and the problem lies within the argument that there is no current theory upon which to practice ANG. This opportunity to examine more closely the subjective and reflexive insider researcher perspective of being an online scholar (as a learner or teacher) would respond to this gap in current eResearch knowledge. This paper uses meta&#8209;ethnography (Noblit & Hare, 1988) as a method to systematically examine methodology relating to autoethnography, with the purpose of working towards developing a framework for undertaking ANG as an emerging eResearch methodology. Seven phases of meta&#8209;ethnography formed the method for synthesising autoethnographic methodological data and translating these into ANG methodological data. Findings from this synthesis are reported through the autoethnographic tripartite scheme of mimesis, poiesis and kinesis (Holman&#8209;Jones, Adams, & Ellis, 2013a). From this synthesis, the autonetnographic “I” framework was developed and forms a methodological basis for future ANG studies to examine teaching and/or learning scholarship in NL and the potential for considering adaptation of ANG for use in eLearning more generally.

A Roadmap to Cope with Common Problems in E&#8209;Learning Research Designs

Abstract:
Abstract: E&#8209;learning research is plenty of difficulties, as also research in education is. Usually, the high number of features involved in e&#8209;learning processes complicates and masks the identification and isolation of the factors which cause the expected benefits, when they exist. At the same time, a bunch of threats are ready to weaken the validity of the research, for example, disregard of previous research, use of small samples, absence of randomization in the assignment to groups, ineffective designs, lack of objectivity in the measuring process, poor descriptions of the research in publications (which implies few possibilities of replication), wrong statistical procedures, inappropriate inference of results, etc. All of these obstacles accumulate and are carried along the whole research, resulting in low quality studies or irrelevant ones. This theoretical paper suggests a roadmap in order to face the most common problems in e&#8209;learning research. The roadmap informs about some cautions which must be considered at each stage of the research and recommendations to increase the validity and reproducibility of results. The roadmap and conclusions included in this paper have been obtained from our experience in educational and e&#8209;learning research, also from our long path as reviewers in key journals of these fields, and from readings of significant research handbooks. This is not a strict guide but a set of milestones on which it is necessary to stop and reflect.

Motivational Gaps and Perceptual Bias of Initial Motivation Additional Indicators of Quality for e&#8209;Learning Courses
Pages:
pp3&#8209;16
Authors:
Rosário Cação
Abstract:
We describe a study on the motivation of trainees in e&#8209;learning&#8209;based professional training and on the effect of their motivation upon the perceptions they build about the quality of the courses. We propose the concepts of perceived motivational gap and real motivational gap as indicators of e&#8209;learning quality, which reflect changes in both perceived and real students' motivation. These indicators help evaluate the changes in the trainees' motivation, as well as the bias that occurs in the perceptions about initial motivation.In the sample analyzed, the real motivational gap was more negative when the perceived motivational gap was negative and not so positive when the perceived motivational gap was positive. We found that there is a perceptual bias on initial motivation when the perceived motivational gap is not null. This means that, for the sample analyzed, the trainees may have “adjusted” their perception regarding the initial motivation as a function of their final motivation, bringing it closer to the latter and supporting their final status. We also show that these gaps help explain how the trainees' perception of quality is affected: the gaps were minimized at higher levels of perceptions of quality and when they were positive, the perception of quality was higher than average.The two proposed conceptual gaps are useful to measure quality in e&#8209;learning and implement specific actions to improve it. The results of our study are useful as they create insights on perceptions of quality in an indirect way, i.e., without asking the trainees to think about what they believe quality is, so that they can quantify it. They also enable training companies to create additional and complementary indicators of quality of e&#8209;learning courses that can help explain changes in perceptions of quality.

Redefining Practice: Challenging Academic and Institutional Traditions With Clinical Distance Learning
Pages:
pp17&#8209;32
Authors:
Laura E Delgaty
Abstract:
With the uptake of distance learning (DL), which has actually been marginal for most academics, teaching contexts, traditional power structures and relationships have been transformed, leaving lecturers potentially disenfranchised. Institutional and cultural change is vital, particularly changes concerning academic roles. The advent of DL has caused role ambiguity; however published literature related to academic roles is confusing and lacks clear guidance. For academics involved in post graduate clinical education, information is even more incomplete. Using a framework of communities, this study is a direct response to these concerns. The aim was to systematically and critically evaluate the implementation of clinical DL in an effort to improve practice.Maintaining a practitioner inquiry methodology, this study investigated the development and delivery of a new DL module. Data collection consisted of documentary analysis of meetings, interviews with staff and students, student evaluations and analytics. Data analysis incorporated both quantitative and qualitative methods to triangulate the research findings.New competencies for academics emerged, including leadership and management. Barriers to staff progress included: ambiguity in roles, lack of leadership and unpreparedness for responsibilities, time, and workload. Student barriers included: time, fear, relevance of learning, isolation and increased autonomy. Explicit planning, organisational support and working within communities were requisite to create a ‘sustaining’ technology.This study contributes to educational practice on two levels. Firstly, by striving for rigour, it demonstrates that practitioner inquiry is a legitimate research approach that is accessible and valuable to teachers. Secondly, it adds to useful and applied knowledge concerning DL practice. Avoiding traditional workload assumptions that are erroneous and inaccurate, this study provides new models of organisational roles and responsibilities. The results challenge the evolutionary nature of academia, suggesting working in communities and new competencies are required whilst traditional roles and culture must be redefined.

An e&#8209;Learning Team’s Life On and Offline: A Collaborative Self&#8209;Ethnography in Postgraduate Education Development
Pages:
pp33&#8209;45
Authors:
Alison Clapp
Abstract:
This paper primarily discusses the methodology of a case study into interactions and working practices of an e&#8209;learning team, on and offline. Although several ethnographies have been published on online learning, there are apparently none involving communities developing courses. This is a unique insight, bringing a new view of course and staff development. The e&#8209;learning team develops courses in the Faculty of Medical Sciences Graduate School in a UK higher education institution. Interactions occur online and offline, the team’s workplace ‘setting’. The ethnography is to inform future staff development by analysing interaction outside the team with the subject specialists, generally time&#8209;poor clinicians and research scientists who have varied experience of e&#8209;learning, but are required to provide course content and to teach their subjects in online distance learning courses. Records kept by team members were enlarged upon via weekly interviews and collated by a team member who developed a narrative, subsequently coded into content themes. The main themes were technology, pedagogy and communication. Conversation analysis provided theories on methods useful in staff development for later action research. Consideration was also given to issues of power within the interactional relationships. The paper discusses challenges and strengths of this collaborative self&#8209;ethnography as a research methodology in this e&#8209;learning setting. It was concluded that collaborative self&#8209;ethnography is a highly suitable research methodology for this type of study.

Abstract:
This paper presents a methodological discussion of the potential and challenges of involving mobile eye tracking technology in studies of knowledge generation and learning in a science centre context. The methodological exploration is based on eye&#8209;tracking studies of audience interaction and knowledge generation in the technology&#8209;enhanced health promotion exhibition PULSE at a science centre in Copenhagen, Denmark. The current study is part of the larger PULSE project, which aims to develop innovative health promotion activities where a science centre exhibition is a key setting. The primary target groups were families with children age 6–12 years and school classes with students from 4th to 6th grade. The main purpose of the study was to understand the methodological potential and challenges mobile eye tracking comprises during the different stages of research on informal e&#8209;learning in a science centre context utilising digital platforms to enhance informal learning and interaction. The paper presents how eye&#8209;tracking methods influence research on: 1) an interventional level: what role eye tracking and eye&#8209;tracking equipment plays in interventions; 2) a data level: what new types of data eye&#8209;tracking methods specifically contribute; and 3) an analytical level: how analysis of eye tracking can supplement and contribute to other analytical approaches. Finally, the article discusses how the methodological approach presented invites consideration of other ways of understanding how users experience technology&#8209;enhanced exhibitions.

Moving Outside the Box: Researching e&#8209;Learning in Disruptive Times

Authors:
Paula Charbonneau-Gowdy
Abstract:
The rise of technology’s influence in a cross&#8209;section of fields within formal education, not to mention in the broader social world, has given rise to new forms in the way we view learning, i.e. what constitutes valid knowledge and how we arrive at that knowledge. Some scholars have claimed that technology is but a tool to support the meaning&#8209;making that lies at the root of knowledge production while others argue that technology is increasingly and inextricably intertwined not just with knowledge construction but with changes to knowledge makers themselves. Regardless which side one stands in this growing debate, it is difficult to deny that the processes we use to research learning supported by technology in order to understand these growing intricacies, have profound implications. In this paper, my aim is to argue and defend a call in the research on ICT for a critical reflective approach to researching technology use. Using examples from qualitative research in e&#8209;learning I have conducted on three continents over 15 years, and in diverse educational contexts, I seek to unravel the means and justification for research approaches that can lead to closing the gap between research and practice. These studies combined with those from a cross&#8209;disciplinary array of fields support the promotion of a research paradigm that examines the socio&#8209;cultural contexts of learning with ICT, at a time that coincides with technology becoming a social networking facilitator. Beyond the examples and justification of the merits and power of qualitative research to uncover the stories that matter in these socially embodied e&#8209;learning contexts, I discuss the methodologically and ethically charged decisions using emerging affordances of technology for analyzing and representing results, including visual ethnography. The implications both for the consumers and producers of research of moving outside the box of established research practices are yet unfathomable but exciting.

Workshops as a Research Methodology

Abstract:
This paper contributes to knowledge on workshops as a research methodology, and specifically on how such workshops pertain to e&#8209;learning. A literature review illustrated that workshops are discussed according to three different perspectives: workshops as a means, workshops as practice, and workshops as a research methodology. Focusing primarily on the latter, this paper presents five studies on upper secondary and higher education teachers’ professional development and on teaching and learning through video conferencing. Through analysis and discussion of these studies’ findings, we argue that workshops provide a platform that can aid researchers in identifying and exploring relevant factors in a given domain by providing means for understanding complex work and knowledge processes that are supported by technology (for example, e&#8209;learning). The approach supports identifying factors that are not obvious to either the participants or the researchers prior to commencing the workshop process. This paper also discusses the facilitator’s different clinical and ethnographic roles and highlights the risks and ethical issues involved during both the workshop process and the workshop data analysis. As such, these collaborative and immersive aspects frame workshops as a research approach that has the potential to advance meaning negotiation between researchers and participants.

Identifying Consistent Variables in a Heterogeneous Data Set: Evaluation of a Web&#8209;Based Pre&#8209;Course in Mathematics

Authors:
Katja Derr
Abstract:
E&#8209;learning has made course evaluation easier in many ways, as a multitude of learner data can be collected and related to student performance. At the same time, open learning environments can be a difficult field for evaluation, with a large variance in participants’ knowledge level, learner behaviour, and commitment. In this study the effectiveness of a mathematics pre&#8209;course administered to four cohorts of prospective students at a technical faculty in Germany was evaluated. Deficits in basic mathematics knowledge are considered one risk factor regarding graduation in STEM&#8209;related subjects, thus the overall goal was to investigate if the pre&#8209;course enabled “at risk” students to improve their starting position. A data analysis was performed, relating students’ preconditions when entering university, their attitude towards mathematics, and their use of learning strategies with further study success. The strongest determinant of first year performance were results in a diagnostic pretest, confirming both the importance of basic mathematics knowledge for academic achievement in engineering and the reliability of the chosen pre&#8209;posttest design. Other outcomes were quite unexpected and demanded deeper analyses. Students who had participated in additional face&#8209;to&#8209;face courses, for example, showed less learning gains than students who had participated in an e&#8209;tutoring version. It also could be observed that meta&#8209;cognitive variables failed to explain successful course participation. Reasons for these outcomes are discussed, suggesting reliability threats and interactions between students’ preconditions and their learner behaviour. A significant and unmoderated impact on students’ learning gains in the pre&#8209;course was found for the number of online test attempts, making this variable a reliable indicator of student engagement. The evaluations show that open learning designs with heterogeneous learner groups can deliver meaningful information, provided that limitations are considered and that external references, like academic grades, are available in order to establish consistency.

The E&#8209;Learning Setting Circle: First Steps Toward Theory Development in E&#8209;Learning Research
Pages:
pp94&#8209;104
Authors:
Marco Rüth

Abstract:
E&#8209;learning projects and related research generate an increasing amount of evidence within and across various disciplines and contexts. The field is very heterogeneous as e&#8209;learning approaches are often characterized by rather unique combinations of situational factors that guide the design and realization of e&#8209;learning in a bottom&#8209;up fashion. Comprehensive theories of e&#8209;learning that allow deductive reasoning and hence a more top&#8209;down strategy are missing so far, but they are highly desirable. In view of the current situation, inductive reasoning is the prevalent way of scientific progress in e&#8209;learning research and the first step toward theory development: individual projects provide the insights necessary to gradually build up comprehensive theories and models. In this context, comparability and generalizability of project results are the keys to success. Here we propose a new model – the E&#8209;Learning Setting Circle – that will promote comparability and generalizability of project results by structuring, standardizing, and guiding e&#8209;learning approaches at the level of a general research methodology. The model comprises three clusters – context setting, structure setting, and content setting – each of which comprises three individual issues that are not necessarily sequential but frequently encountered in e&#8209;learning projects. Two further elements are incorporated: on the one hand, we delineate the central role of objective setting and the assessment of the goal attainment level (guiding element); on the other hand, we highlight the importance of multi&#8209;criteria decision&#8209;making (universal element). Overall, the proposed circular model is a strategic framework intended to foster theory development in the area of e&#8209;learning projects and research.

Title:
Motivational Gaps and Perceptual Bias of Initial Motivation Additional Indicators of Quality for e&#8209;Learning Courses
Pages:
pp3&#8209;16
Authors:
Rosário Cação
Abstract:
We describe a study on the motivation of trainees in e&#8209;learning&#8209;based professional training and on the effect of their motivation upon the perceptions they build about the quality of the courses. We propose the concepts of perceived motivational gap and real motivational gap as indicators of e&#8209;learning quality, which reflect changes in both perceived and real students' motivation. These indicators help evaluate the changes in the trainees' motivation, as well as the bias that occurs in the perceptions about initial motivation.In the sample analyzed, the real motivational gap was more negative when the perceived motivational gap was negative and not so positive when the perceived motivational gap was positive. We found that there is a perceptual bias on initial motivation when the perceived motivational gap is not null. This means that, for the sample analyzed, the trainees may have “adjusted” their perception regarding the initial motivation as a function of their final motivation, bringing it closer to the latter and supporting their final status. We also show that these gaps help explain how the trainees' perception of quality is affected: the gaps were minimized at higher levels of perceptions of quality and when they were positive, the perception of quality was higher than average.The two proposed conceptual gaps are useful to measure quality in e&#8209;learning and implement specific actions to improve it. The results of our study are useful as they create insights on perceptions of quality in an indirect way, i.e., without asking the trainees to think about what they believe quality is, so that they can quantify it. They also enable training companies to create additional and complementary indicators of quality of e&#8209;learning courses that can help explain changes in perceptions of quality.

Title:
Redefining Practice: Challenging Academic and Institutional Traditions With Clinical Distance Learning
Pages:
pp17&#8209;32
Authors:
Laura E Delgaty
Abstract:
With the uptake of distance learning (DL), which has actually been marginal for most academics, teaching contexts, traditional power structures and relationships have been transformed, leaving lecturers potentially disenfranchised. Institutional and cultural change is vital, particularly changes concerning academic roles. The advent of DL has caused role ambiguity; however published literature related to academic roles is confusing and lacks clear guidance. For academics involved in post graduate clinical education, information is even more incomplete. Using a framework of communities, this study is a direct response to these concerns. The aim was to systematically and critically evaluate the implementation of clinical DL in an effort to improve practice.Maintaining a practitioner inquiry methodology, this study investigated the development and delivery of a new DL module. Data collection consisted of documentary analysis of meetings, interviews with staff and students, student evaluations and analytics. Data analysis incorporated both quantitative and qualitative methods to triangulate the research findings.New competencies for academics emerged, including leadership and management. Barriers to staff progress included: ambiguity in roles, lack of leadership and unpreparedness for responsibilities, time, and workload. Student barriers included: time, fear, relevance of learning, isolation and increased autonomy. Explicit planning, organisational support and working within communities were requisite to create a ‘sustaining’ technology.This study contributes to educational practice on two levels. Firstly, by striving for rigour, it demonstrates that practitioner inquiry is a legitimate research approach that is accessible and valuable to teachers. Secondly, it adds to useful and applied knowledge concerning DL practice. Avoiding traditional workload assumptions that are erroneous and inaccurate, this study provides new models of organisational roles and responsibilities. The results challenge the evolutionary nature of academia, suggesting working in communities and new competencies are required whilst traditional roles and culture must be redefined.

An e&#8209;Learning Team’s Life On and Offline: A Collaborative Self&#8209;Ethnography in Postgraduate Education Development
Pages:
pp33&#8209;45
Authors:
Alison Clapp
Abstract:
This paper primarily discusses the methodology of a case study into interactions and working practices of an e&#8209;learning team, on and offline. Although several ethnographies have been published on online learning, there are apparently none involving communities developing courses. This is a unique insight, bringing a new view of course and staff development. The e&#8209;learning team develops courses in the Faculty of Medical Sciences Graduate School in a UK higher education institution. Interactions occur online and offline, the team’s workplace ‘setting’. The ethnography is to inform future staff development by analysing interaction outside the team with the subject specialists, generally time&#8209;poor clinicians and research scientists who have varied experience of e&#8209;learning, but are required to provide course content and to teach their subjects in online distance learning courses. Records kept by team members were enlarged upon via weekly interviews and collated by a team member who developed a narrative, subsequently coded into content themes. The main themes were technology, pedagogy and communication. Conversation analysis provided theories on methods useful in staff development for later action research. Consideration was also given to issues of power within the interactional relationships. The paper discusses challenges and strengths of this collaborative self&#8209;ethnography as a research methodology in this e&#8209;learning setting. It was concluded that collaborative self&#8209;ethnography is a highly suitable research methodology for this type of study.

Abstract:
This paper presents a methodological discussion of the potential and challenges of involving mobile eye tracking technology in studies of knowledge generation and learning in a science centre context. The methodological exploration is based on eye&#8209;tracking studies of audience interaction and knowledge generation in the technology&#8209;enhanced health promotion exhibition PULSE at a science centre in Copenhagen, Denmark. The current study is part of the larger PULSE project, which aims to develop innovative health promotion activities where a science centre exhibition is a key setting. The primary target groups were families with children age 6–12 years and school classes with students from 4th to 6th grade. The main purpose of the study was to understand the methodological potential and challenges mobile eye tracking comprises during the different stages of research on informal e&#8209;learning in a science centre context utilising digital platforms to enhance informal learning and interaction. The paper presents how eye&#8209;tracking methods influence research on: 1) an interventional level: what role eye tracking and eye&#8209;tracking equipment plays in interventions; 2) a data level: what new types of data eye&#8209;tracking methods specifically contribute; and 3) an analytical level: how analysis of eye tracking can supplement and contribute to other analytical approaches. Finally, the article discusses how the methodological approach presented invites consideration of other ways of understanding how users experience technology&#8209;enhanced exhibitions.

Abstract:
Student engagement is key to successful teaching and learning, irrespective of the content and format of the content delivery mechanism. However, engaging students presents a particular challenge in online learning environments. Unlike face&#8209;to&#8209;face courses, online courses present a unique challenge as the only social presence between the faculty and the student is via the Internet. In a recent poll conducted by the authors, 100% of the respondents considered student engagement a challenge regardless of the number of years they have been teaching online. This paper explores various strategies that can be incorporated into the design of online learning courses to foster a high level of student engagement based on multiple pedagogies. In addition, the role of collaborative student engagement tools for the design and delivery of online courses is discussed as well as the role these tools play in creating an atmosphere where students actively participate in learning activities and are contributors to lively discussions. Perspectives on various mechanisms of student engagement that are founded in classic active learning pedagogies and enhanced with new technologies are presented in this paper, including perspectives on the design of courses to facilitate student engagement as well as best practices of design and delivery of online courses. Finally, this paper emphasizes the importance of deliberate course design in the pursuit of actively engaging students in online course settings.

Abstract:
Due to the potential of the Internet and blended learning environment, students, especially L2 learners, are often required to read references available online. A study was conducted to identify the perceptions of L2 learners comprising TESL undergraduates towards TESL&#8209;related hypermedia reading materials and the factors contributing to their reading comprehension. This case study involved eleven third&#8209;year undergraduate TESL students enrolled in a course called ‘Teaching of Reading Skills in an ESL Context’. Data was collected using Think Aloud Protocol, semi&#8209;structured interviews, and reflective notes. The findings of this study revealed various participants’ perceptions regarding hypermedia reading materials. Among the factors that improved their reading comprehension include the design of the hypermedia materials and content in terms of the manner in which information was displayed. The participants highlighted the difficulties associated with reading long hypertexts and expressed preference for texts which come in point&#8209;form format. Other features cited as being helpful in their reading were the inclusion of pictures, tables, diagrams, audio materials, and videos along with the text. Some other features included hyperlinks and glossaries provided by the websites that the students found beneficial in helping them understand the text. Other less favorable aspects of reading hypermedia materials included advertisements on the websites, easy access to social media websites, and poor Internet connection and bandwidth speed. These were reported to affect the reading process in such a way that they distracted the participants’ concentration, and this ultimately affected reading comprehension to a certain degree. It is hoped that these findings could provide insights for course developers in developing or selecting websites to suit their teaching and learning purposes.

Abstract:
This paper presents how virtual containers enhance the implementation of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) subjects as Open Educational Resources (OER). The publication initially summarizes the limitations of delivering open rich learning contents and corresponding assignments to students in college level STEAM areas. The role that virtual containers can play in current distant education is then discussed, starting by reviewing related teaching efforts around the use of legacy virtual machines. We then focus on the superseding container technology and how it can bridge the gap between online students, humble computing resources, teachers and IT specificities. As a practical example, we present an experience carried out at the online School of Engineering & Technology at Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR). Within the context of a subject about Physics for Computing Engineers, we describe the satisfactory evolution from using conventional software distribution methods towards the transition to virtual containers. Thanks to this virtualization approach, the necessary student activities can be implemented, the required software tools can be easily distributed, and the accompanying documentation can be seamlessly presented. The results show how student engagement and satisfaction increased over time, partly because of the easiness introduced by the container technology. Our experience proves that combining containerized educational resources and free and open distribution channels can be one of the cornerstones of a new OER approach in STEAM subjects.

Abstract:
The integration of E&#8209;learning has expanded in a variety of directions to a degree that its successful application is of great importance to all sectors of education and training. E&#8209;learning can offer unquestionable advantages to everyone involved in both the assessment and the knowledge transfer process (Owens and Floyd 2007; Luchoomun, McLuckie and van Wesel 2010; Damyanov and Tsankov 2016). Some of the challenges of e&#8209;learning methods rest in choosing the right platform, and in determining the scope of the selected material as well as the adequacy of its user friendly methodology. Among the features of e&#8209;learning platforms that are applicable to a wider audience is the criterion of multi&#8209;language application. As regards E&#8209;learning in foreign language education, there are three pragmatic and cultural aspects which are often omitted from the e&#8209;learning system: 1) the transfer of idiomatic competence; 2) the acquisition of cultural concepts; and 3) the inclusion of small and endangered languages. This is not the case with the elaboration of the e&#8209;learning platform IPHRAS &#8209; Interphraseologie für Studien&#8209;und Berufsmobile. The proposed paper presents its main achievements and focuses on the methodology for foreign language learning in a multilingual electronic environment. The process is facilitated by the incorporation of thematically structured multiword units (idioms and collocations). Its priority is easy access to a variety of languages, including Greek, Turkish, Romanian, Bulgarian, through more popular languages such as English and German. The degree of translation equivalence of its elements facilitates not only multilingualism, but also the initial phase of mastering the vocabulary of additional languages. The IPHRAS platform was elaborated by an international team of Balkan researchers and language instructors and funded by the European Commission within the Lifelong learning program.

Abstract:
The growing global demand for tertiary education has led to the increased use of e&#8209;learning approaches around the world. Demand has increased most rapidly in low and middle income countries (LMICs), which account for half of the students currently enrolled in higher educational institutions (HEIs). But the implementation of e&#8209;learning programmes in resource&#8209;constrained settings faces many obstacles. This paper explores some of the key issues involved in implementation of e&#8209;learning in HEIs involved in the education of health professionals, given the resource constraints within which many institutions have to function. We present case studies of three such LMIC institutions of varying size and primary purpose. The paper suggests use of appropriate ICT infrastructure, both in terms of hardware and software, combined with effective access and bandwidth management policies is crucial to the successful implementation of e&#8209;learning courses on health within HEIs based in LMICs.

Abstract:
Today’s 21st century students are regarded as ‘digital natives’, who are influenced by digital environments for acquisition of information, communication and interaction. With the emergence of new technologies, educators are encouraged to find meaningful ways of incorporating these technologies into their classrooms. The practice currently in South African classrooms is still the traditional lecture method, which poses limitations on students’ learning due to its frequent lack of interaction and communication between students and educators. As a result, there is a need for educators to adjust their teaching methods and create learning environments that stimulate dialogue and engagement in and outside the classroom. This paper presents results of an evaluation of the effectiveness of the use of Facebook social media as communicative media, Clicker technology as an interactive medium, and Wiley Plus web&#8209;based homework system as an adaptive medium for enhancing learning through interaction and dialogue activities in and outside the first year Physics classroom as described in Laurilland’s framework. Both quantitative and qualitative methods of collecting data were used in this study. A student feedback questionnaire and focus group interviews were carried out to elicit students’ opinions on the effectiveness of the use of these technologies in the first year introductory Engineering Physics course. Quantitative data on student performance was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics, while qualitative data was analysed using inductive strategy. Results showed that the use of Clickers and Facebook facilitated interactions between students and their teacher, in and outside the classroom, which resulted in deep and meaningful collaborative learning of the subject content. This resulted in better student performance in the homework and assignments done on the Wiley Plus web&#8209;based homework system, which may have contributed to the good performance of the students in both mid&#8209;term Examination and Final integrated Summative Assessment (FISA).

Abstract:
Instructional design is an important aspect of the learning experience within formal online courses. One way in which online instructional design may benefit students is by increasing their future behavioral intention to use educational materials. This is important because research has revealed that students’ use of educational resources is strongly connected with academic success. Additionally, higher quality instructional design will increase students’ levels of germane cognitive load, which is a powerful indicator of learning. This study surveyed a group of students (n = 1314) who participated in formal online classes in South Korea to investigate the relationships between instructional design and germane load, germane load and future behavioral intention, as well as instructional design and future behavioral intention. Results showed positive correlation among each of these relationships. Furthermore, a mediation model was used, and results showed that germane load completely mediates the relationship between instructional design and future behavioral intention. These relationships are examined to better understand learning and future behavioral intention in relation to instructional design within online learning environments.

Abstract:
Exploring the challenges and opportunities associated with the concepts of community and communication in online higher education, this paper reconsiders the intention to replicate face&#8209;to&#8209;face learning and teaching strategies in online learning environments. Rather than beginning with the assumption that face&#8209;to&#8209;face education is the prototype for quality, the authors appraise the online learning environment as a unique medium which, by its nature, necessitates unique communication, community&#8209;building, teaching and learning strategies. This paper proposes an in&#8209;depth analysis of the potential unique affordances associated with online learning contexts as existing in their own right. The concepts of community and communication are explored in relation to online Communities of Practice (CoPs). The nature of face&#8209;to&#8209;face and online learning contexts are considered, especially in the light of the possibility of redefining “face&#8209;to&#8209;face” within the online realm, in addition to physical learning contexts. The paper identifies unique ways in which online communication (in the context of learning) is different from face&#8209;to&#8209;face communication, and consequently four ways in which this can be an advantage for students; namely, there is a measure of social egalitarianism, emphasis on verbal/written proficiency, time for reasoned response, and social agency. The paper provides grounding for further research into strategies that forge rich online learning experiences and suggests an empirical study as a next step.

Abstract:
The metrics of self efficacy and self assessment were surveyed and analysed in order to examine the effectiveness of note taking instruction on emotional aspects of participants during a blended learning course. The changes of emotional aspects due to student's individual characteristics were also analysed. Participants were surveyed twice during the course, using the metrics mentioned above, and their emotional and cognitive changes were evaluated. The number of valid participants was 54. Scores of metrics between the two surveys were compared. Though most scores for self&#8209;efficacy and self assessment decreased, this suggests that participants recognised their actual learning situation well. The relationship between the metrics and student's characteristics was examined. To illustrate participant's emotional and cognitive changes, causal analysis was introduced. The relationships between scores for self&#8209;efficacy and self evaluation in the two surveys were analysed and compared. Also, the impact of improvements in note&#8209;taking skills on changes in self&#8209;efficacy and self&#8209;evaluation were examined using causal analyses. These results show that note&#8209;taking activities significantly stimulated the level of self&#8209;efficacy and self&#8209;assessment when the lecturer's instructions were able to improve note&#8209;taking skills factor scores during the course.

Abstract:
Students claim to learn a lot from advising and feedback on assignments. This is one of the results in a survey amongst students at The Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences. Traditionally, advising is mainly a face&#8209;to&#8209;face activity. However, with an increasing number of courses offered online, it is timely to discuss how to conduct advising sessions online and using an online medium. The meeting between the student and advisor contains a number of factors; for example: eye contact, tone of voice and facial mimic. Many subtle features establish the relationship between the advisor and student. The student needs to communicate the assignment and to trust the advisor, at the other hand the advisor needs to be reassured that the student understand and trust the feedback. This paper discusses how written advising sessions can be undertaken using an online medium, and still maintain the roles, the trust and secure the communication.

Abstract:
The methods of geospatial data processing are being continually innovated, and universities that are focused on educating experts in Environmental Science should reflect this reality with an elaborate and purpose&#8209;built modernization of the education process, education content, as well as learning conditions. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have the dominant role in geospatial data processing. GIS education of students in Environmental Science (ES) in master´s degree can be divided into two main approaches &#8209; to teach about GIS and to teach with GIS. Approach “to teach with GIS” is mainly focused on teaching of Landscape Spatial Analysis with use of concrete GIS analytical tools. Students use the tools for solving of concrete problems. They work with real data and methods. The spatial analysis learned can help to manage conflicts of interest within the country, and to assess the impact of human activity on the environment. On the other hand students learn about GIS via tools and methods in concrete GIS software. To achieve higher efficiency in teaching Landscape Spatial Analysis we have created a model of GIS education based on the idea of inquiry&#8209;based learning (IBL). In an effort to get closer to the approach used for real problematic task solving, it is essential to include several interconnected systems into the education. While the Global Positioning System (GPS) Web Map Service (WMS) and Database management systems (DBMS) present the work with geospatial data similarly as GIS, Learning Management System (LMS) represents a valuable information source for students as well as an instrument for communication between teacher and students and among the students themselves during work on student projects. The proposed model can offer support of student´s motivation to learn, increased efficiency of education process and improvement preparation of students for their profession.

Do Authors of Online Electronic Materials for Teaching Mathematics use Their Potential to use Non&#8209;Stereotypical Cultural Settings?
Pages:
pp235&#8209;243
Authors:
Hana Moraová
Abstract:
The paper focuses on the cultural content of online electronic materials developed primarily by Czech in&#8209;service teachers of mathematics for smartboards. The author presents an analysis of these materials with a focus on the cultural settings of word problems they contain. The paper builds on a poster presented on ECEL 2015 conference and a paper presented on ECEL 2016 conference. The question the author asks is how innovative electronic materials are as far as their cultural, non&#8209;mathematical content is concerned. Are these materials a mere conversion of problems from traditional hardcopy textbooks or have its authors gone further, introducing new motives, images and realities? Do they use the potential of the online environment that allows easy updates (unlike hardcopy textbooks that are used without any change for years, even decades)? The author builds on her research in the area of non&#8209;mathematical content of mathematics textbooks (Moraová, 2013) and of problems posed by teacher trainees (Moraová, 2014). The here presented research combines qualitative and quantitative approaches. The author analyses one hundred and seventeen online activities from the website www.veskole.cz. Word problems are classified according to their cultural content and the most frequent images are described and commented upon. The findings of this study are of interest to in&#8209;service mathematics teachers planning to develop an online teaching unit, mathematics educators but also policy makers as not much attention is paid to the cultural contents of mathematics teaching materials.

Teaching Aids and Work With Models in e&#8209;Learning Environments

Abstract:
PISA study has defined several key areas to be paid attention to by teachers. One of these areas is work with models. The term model can be understood very broadly, it can refer to a drawing of a chemical reaction, a plastic model, a permanent mount (taxidermy) to advanced 3D projections. Teachers are no longer confined to teaching materials and aids available physically at schools. Thanks to information technology, models can be included in lessons almost without any limits. However, work with models is very specific due to the simple fact that a model always differs from what it represents. Efficiency of education using ICT can be affected negatively in case that work with complex models requires high level of abstraction which pupils are not capable of (Harrison and Treagust, 2000). Jančaříková (2015) points out that – due to the demands on upper secondary pupils – children must be taught how to relate models to real objects from very early stages. Linking an object to its model – isomorphism is the basis for successful work with models. Work with models thus must be developed systematically and consistently and included into teaching of younger learners. The scope of work with models in natural sciences is gradually increasing. However, the fact that we are able to project models to pupils using information technology does not mean that pupils will be able to understand them. In this paper we want to point out that not enough attention is paid to work with models (not only in the Czech Republic) – methodology of work with models does not exist and is not taught to pre&#8209;service teachers. The paper classifies types of models we come across in lessons, describes basic differences between objects and reality they represent and proposes possible ways of systematic inclusion of models into teaching.

GeoGebra Materials for LMS Moodle Focused Monge on Projection

Authors:
Věra Ferdiánová
Abstract:
“The use of e&#8209;learning and modern technologies is an integral part of teaching descriptive geometry” (Rankowski and Minaruth, 1979). Teachers often create Flash animations, websites and other interactive materials for their students using special tools and software; e.g. Cabri, GeoGebra or Construct 3D (García et al, 2007). There is an option of installing GeoGebra plugin within the frame of LMS Moodle, which results in having two important parts of self&#8209;study in one place. Thus, it might be a solid background for creation of integrated materials, which should support the development of spatial imagination. However, “this is the ability most students lack, which results in having problems with understanding simple tasks in descriptive geometry” (Gittler and Judith, 1998), which also leads to the fact, that Monge projection is not a favourite topic for them. This article continues the paper (Ferdiánová and Poruba, 2016), in which paper models of basic tasks in Monge projection, designed as supportive material for teaching geometry, were presented. The aim of this paper is to introduce interactive materials for Monge projection, which are implemented into LMS Moodle, as well as show results of pilot research of influence of using these materials on students. Students have geometric tasks, anaglyph models and templates for creation of paper models, which were used for better visualisation of geometric relationships in space, at disposal. Outcomes of pilot research questionnaires and tests are processed by basic statistical methods, e.g. Wilcox test. Outcomes of pilot testing influence further changes of usage interactive materials and LMS Moodle in self&#8209;study process.

Abstract:
Developing countries lacking capabilities, funds and human resources are compelled to improve the digital literacy rates of their task force through educational initiatives. This is the case of Tunisia where a stand&#8209;alone in&#8209;service teacher education (Ted) initiative was implemented in 2014 and 2015. The aim of this project, the Tech Age Teacher Project (TATP), was to equip teachers in Tunisia with the technology skills for teaching so that they can dispense teaching of a 21st&#8209;century education quality. Five English language teachers, who benefitted from this initiative, are the focus of this study. The aim was to explore whether and how they are making the transition into the technologically&#8209;challenged schools. Analysis of the TATP documents, data is collected through a short teacher questionnaire and a semi&#8209;structured interview during which teachers give their personal accounts as TAT trainees and their attempts to apply the ideas in real school settings. Results indicated that teachers showed great dedication toward implementing the ideas/skills received in the training and that they strove, as technology&#8209;capable teachers, to integrate technology in their day&#8209;to&#8209;day practice despite the constraints they faced in the schools. Their accounts reveal their rationale and motives for using technology with their students and the strategies they employ to circumvent obstacles, but also show that their success in integrating technology remains restricted by issues of infrastructure, barred access to a technology space, learners' "playful" attitudes, etc. The findings highlight these teachers' resourcefulness and sense of mission as to transforming their learners' learning experience and changing their attitudes towards technology use and to fostering 21st&#8209;century education learning goals. The paper concludes with recommendations for future initiatives to (re)design and (re)orient the goals of the initiative towards supporting these teachers' learning processes as they make the transition as technology&#8209;capable teachers into the technology&#8209;challenged schools. Recommendations are made for the emerging professional community of technology&#8209;capable teachers to build a networked community of practice likely to foster these teachers' reconstruction of their professional knowledge and skills and to facilitate the dissemination of ideas on the integration of technology in education.

Abstract:
This paper investigated students’ achievement for learning American Sign Language (ASL), using two different methods. There were two groups of samples. The first experimental group (Group A) was the game&#8209;based learning for ASL, using Kinect. The second control learning group (Group B) was the traditional face&#8209;to&#8209;face learning method, generally used in sign language skill training for students with hearing impairments. This study was separated into two phases. In Phase I: 3D trajectory matching measurement algorithm, the Euclidean distance algorithm was employed to present the similarity between teacher and student datasets. Then, Phase II: Effectiveness of the Game&#8209;Based Learning system, showed the proposed framework of the game&#8209;based learning for sign language. Moreover, knowledge of sign language together with the corresponding actions were captured from three sign language experts using the knowledge engineering method. Then, the proposed game&#8209;based system would be analysed to provide students immediate feedbacks and suggestions based on the knowledge transfer from ASL experts. In the experiment, the students (N=31) were divided into two groups. The first group, Group A (N=17), learnt with the game&#8209;based learning while the second group, Group B (N=14), learnt with the traditional face to face learning method. The study result showed a significant difference (p

Abstract:
Games have been successfully used in educational settings for many years. Still, it is not known in detail which factors influence the use and effectiveness of educational games. The game environment, its technology, and other game mechanics are factors directly linked to the game itself. The player’s experience with the subject of the game and/or games in general, his or her motivation and expectations towards the gaming experience influence the outcome of a game&#8209;based learning experience. Some of the personal aspects, like age, were already addressed in earlier research. Cultural and gender differences though, were not a main object of study in educational gaming so far. This study started from certain assumptions about differences in game play, related to players’ cultural backgrounds and gender. Literature suggests that gender plays a role when it comes to game performance. This paper introduces outcomes of a study with a so&#8209;called Microgame, a brief game used to raise the awareness of interdependent planning operations. It shows that in this game, gender and culture make a difference in relation to the learning experience of the players, measured by game performance.

Exploring the Relation between the Theory of Multiple Intelligences and Games For the Purpose of Player&#8209;Centred Game Design

Abstract:
A large body of research work demonstrates the importance and effectiveness of adapting a learning game to its players. This process is driven by understanding the differences between individuals in terms of abilities and preferences. One of the rather interesting but least explored approaches for understanding individual differences among learners is Gardner’s theory of Multiple Intelligences (MI). Gardner suggests that people exhibit multiple dimensions of intelligence or abilities. In the literature, it is suggested that people with different types of intellectual strengths (intelligences) often exhibit clear preferences toward specific modalities and types of interaction and content in relation to learning. This raises the question whether this knowledge could be transferred and employed in adapting learning games to players, more in particular for the purpose of improving the game and/or learning experience, as well as the learning outcome of the players. Although various claims regarding the existence of a relationship between MI and games have been made, none of them are substantiated with empirical evidence.This paper presents the results of an empirical study that has led to evidence&#8209;based mappings between the different dimensions of intelligences proposed in MI and the fundamental building blocks of games, i.e. game mechanics. These mappings indicate which game mechanics suit which MI dimensions, and can therefore act as design guidelines when designing games targeting people exhibiting dominance for specific MI dimensions. A tool that visualizes these mappings and facilitates their use in the design of such player&#8209;centred (learning) games is also presented.

Title:
An Approach to Scoring Collaboration in Online Game Environments

Abstract:
With technological advances, it is now possible to use games to capture information&#8209;rich behaviours that reveal processes by which players interact and solve problems. Recent problem&#8209;based games have been designed to assess and record detailed interactions between the problem solver and the game environment, and thereby capture salient solution processes in an unobtrusive way (Zoanetti, 2010; Bennett et al., 2003; Shute & Wang, 2009). The Assessment and Teaching of 21st Century Skills project used an innovative approach to capture these processes through responses (activities and communication patterns) within collaborative games (Griffin & Care, 2015). Game player response patterns are identified as behaviours that are indicative of skills and are captured in real&#8209;time game play within time&#8209;structured log files. The analysis of these log files allows for inferences to be drawn in regard to the efficiency and quality of player performance. A concern with this approach is that game development for this purpose is complex, time consuming and expensive, with unique scoring applied to each game. This paper presents another approach that identifies, across games, common behaviours. A systematic scoring system for assessing player behaviours in games could provide access to useful data not only from new games but from existing games. This paper presents such an approach using collaborative games situated in a problem&#8209;solving context.

Abstract:
Game&#8209;based learning has been a strong emerging trend in the 21st century, but several research studies on game&#8209;based learning reports that the educational potential of games has not been fully realised. Many educational games do not combine learning outcomes with entertaining gameplay. At the same time as there is a tendency to digitise and personalise education by the use of digital games, there still exists a lack of knowledge about efficient educational game design. To identify design factors that are important for players' learning motivation this study has analysed three popular entertainment games that were selected for their  educational values.The aim of the study is to explore, analyse and discuss, if and how motivating factors and intrinsic integration of knowledge in educational games might be related to players' perceived knowledge acquisition. Test players with experience of the selected digital games were recruited from online gaming forums where a questionnaire also was used to collect data. Lepper's and Malone's set of heuristics for intrinsic motivation in interactive learning environments were used in a combination with Habgood's and Ainsworth's theory of intrinsic integration to examine the relationship between these factors in the educational games. Beside the direct acquisition of knowledge from gaming there was also an analysis of the concept of tangential learning. Results from a t&#8209;test showed that tangential learning was significantly more important for two of the tested games. Correlation analysis revealed several relationships between factors, where intrinsic integration was pointed out as particularly interesting for knowledge acquisition and tangential learning. Results showed weak or no relationships for Lepper and Malone factors, but with some tendencies for control, imagination and competition.

Abstract:
Educational video games (EVGs) are gaining momentum as a means of increasing students’ motivation in their learning process. Nevertheless, teachers might face several barriers that dissuade them from using educational video games in their courses. This study analyses factors affecting teachers´ behavioural intention to use educational video games in their courses using a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) approach. The research model is tested via structural equation modelling (SEM) on a sample of 312 teachers in Higher Education institutions. Results suggest that perceived usefulness influences in a direct and positive way teachers’ intention to use educational video games. Results also suggest that perceived ease of use indirectly influence intentions through perceived usefulness. Age was found to moderate the effect of teachers’ perceived ease of use on perceived usefulness of EVGs. Regarding managerial implications, our findings highlight the importance of addressing specific Teacher Training Programmes focusing on teachers’ age and perceived usefulness of EVGs in order to encourage teachers to adopting this educational innovation in their courses. Limitations of the study and future research lines are also addressed.

Open Teaching: a New Way on E&#8209;learning?

Abstract:
Open Teaching is currently considered an ambiguous and polysemic concept but has nevertheless become a growing global trend in ICT&#8209;based education. To identify key issues on the subject, this article presents a study on Open teaching that combines meta&#8209;synthesis and content analysis of research published over the last twenty years in major peer&#8209;reviewed databases. Six main analytical categories emerge from data, conforming six groups of findings. Those findings show that Open Teaching has been associated with various concepts over the years and that there is no consensus on its meaning in the academic community. The current understanding of Open Teaching, that it is merely related to distance education, thwarts important practical and conceptual possibilities by prioritizing access as its main feature and ignoring important “openness” attributes, such as adaptation, sharing, remixing or collaboration. Moreover, the findings note that the most common means to implement Open Teaching as an ICT&#8209;based practice are derived from the use of Open Educational Resources (OER) and via Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) which represents not only a major challenge for active educational practitioners but a new way of conceiving and implementing e&#8209;learning in higher education.

Abstract:
Electronic resources have become a dominant feature of higher education, both traditional and distance learning based. Unlike in the past when universities relied majorly on the physical library and hard copy of books, e&#8209;books accessible through e&#8209;libraries are the dominant features of this century’s institutions of higher learning.  This study investigated pre&#8209;service teacher trainees by distance and the utilization of e&#8209;learning resources. A survey research design was used to carry out the study. One hundred and forty four (144) pre&#8209;service teachers by distance from three institutions offering teacher training programmes by distance in South Africa completed the anonymous web based survey designed to gather data which provide answers to the five (5) research questions in the study. The results revealed a high utilization of e&#8209;resources to learn but a low utilization of e&#8209;resources to teach among the respondents. The study recommends institutional based training on the techniques of accessing and utilizing e&#8209;learning resources for pre&#8209;service teacher trainees in ODL institutions.

Abstract:
The introduction of technologies into the teaching and learning environment has implied changes to the way education plays out in an e&#8209;Environment. Previous research has highlighted the many barriers and challenges in integration technology into teaching and learning. Technology is said to be underutilised. However there are studies that have identified that teachers are using technology in their work. Little is known about the extent of this use of technology. Accordingly less is known about teachers’ e&#8209;Learning practices. This paper seeks to highlight the patterns in teachers’ e&#8209;Learning practices.Using a blend of inductive and deductive techniques data was collected from a sample of teachers known to be using technology in their work. The study was framed by the: (i) Development in use and stages of teaching and learning with technologies (UNESCO) and (ii) Technological skills developmental levels (DoE). The data from the study has highlighted patterns in the use and practice of technology integration in school education. These patterns could be mapped to continuums of use and practice. It has been found that teachers used technology for a variety of purposes: personal, administration, teaching and learning at different frequencies and at varying levels of intensity. Teachers were found to use technology for e&#8209;Teaching and e&#8209;Learning progressively and in ways that was aligned to their comfort zones. The way teachers’ used technology was found to be progressive from simple to innovative.

Abstract:
The U.S. defense industry spends billions of dollars each year developing defense systems to keep the nation and allies secure.  However, the failure rate of system development is notoriously high.   Even when development efforts do succeed, they often do so with cost overruns and compromises in system performance.  As a result, large amounts of money are wasted in defense acquisition, leaving the nation both poorer and less secure than it could be.Though this problem is certainly multi&#8209;faceted, one way to approach the problem is to provide better systems engineering education to engineers.  Systems engineering skills, generally considered to be key to the successful development of large scale systems, often require many years to acquire.  However, recent research investigates the theory that these years can be reduced through the use of simulation software.This paper describes Project Robot, a defense systems engineering simulator designed to facilitate the acquisition of systems engineering skills at an increased rate.  Project Robot was the co&#8209;winner of the 2010 Experience Accelerator international systems engineering simulator competition held at Stevens Institute of Technology, NJ.  The development of this simulator is a first step towards the design and development of experience accelerating simulations and software games that push the boundaries of engineering education to the next level using modern computer software techniques.  The paper introduces the concepts of systems engineering and systems thinking, then discusses the Project Robot game concept, design, theory, and implementation, including detailed screen captures.  The paper concludes with a discussion of the future of Project Robot and related research efforts to improve systems engineering education through simulation.

M.H.Mirzamohammadi
Abstract:
The present research aimed to investigate the feasibility of e&#8209;learning implementation in an Iranian comprehensive university (included medical and non&#8209;medical fields) to provide appropriate solutions in this regard. To achieve this objective, seven research questions were formed. Surveying method was applied for data collection in this study. From the results, the readiness of the Iranian university to implement e&#8209;learning was moderate to low. This means that the Iranian university is not prepared for this type of learning. Accordingly, five factors were evaluated of which three factors: human, infrastructural, and cultural factors were in moderate to low level, and two factors: pedagogical and support, were at a low level. Ten basic strategies for successful implementation of e&#8209;learning were extracted at the Iranian university based on the studied five factors and they were presented according to the knowledge and research in the field of e&#8209;learning in the world and in Iran. Some of these consisted of holding training courses at the university level, considering a special place for e&#8209;learning in the university strategic plan, developing a mechanism for monitoring the activities of teaching and research in e&#8209;learning environment for students and faculty, and allocating and spending an appropriate budget.

Abstract:
Gamification is the use of game design elements in non&#8209;game contexts and it is gaining momentum in a wide range of areas including education. Despite increasing academic research exploring the use of gamification in education little is known about teachers’ main drivers and barriers to using gamification in their courses. Using a phenomenology approach, 16 online structured interviews were conducted in order to explore the main drivers that encourage teachers serving in Higher Education institutions to using gamification in their courses. The main barriers that prevent teachers from using gamification were also analysed. Four main drivers (attention&#8209;motivation, entertainment, interactivity, and easiness to learn) and four main barriers (lack of resources, students’ apathy, subject fit, and classroom dynamics) were identified. Results suggest that teachers perceive the use of gamification both as beneficial but also as a potential risk for classroom atmosphere. Managerial recommendations for managers of Higher Education institutions, limitations of the study, and future research lines are also addressed.

Abstract:
In South Africa, the Western Cape government (WCG)’s current broadband strategy aims to ensure that all schools will be connected to broadband service within a reasonable time&#8209;frame. According to the WCG integration of ICTs and the broadband will remove the digital divide and enhance curriculum delivery in schools.  To achieve this, sensible long&#8209;term planning must be in place to ensure that subject advisors are adequately trained and equipped to participate in the connected schools environment and effectively assist teachers integrate digital resources into classrooms. The aim of this paper is to explore how subject advisors perceive of their preparedness to embrace new technologies for their advisory job; to ensure effective teaching and learning.  A qualitative research approach was used; randomly selected education districts in the Western Cape Province provided subject advisors to be participants in the study. Results show that most subject advisors perceive their complex knowledge of how to effectively integrate ICTs into curriculum delivery as inadequate hence are hesitant to advise teachers on effective technology integration into classrooms.

Abstract:
Storytelling plays a vital role to impart a nation’s tradition, cultural beliefs and history to future generation. It is frequently used for the purpose of sharing or exchanging information as it enables the messages to be conveyed to the audience easily. Storytelling acts as a tool of human social interaction and is commonly used in education for learning, explaining and entertaining. Due to the learning effectiveness brought up by storytelling, this study is aimed to compare and differentiate the feasibility of traditional storytelling and multimedia storytelling in motivating and leveraging the non&#8209;native novices’ learning of Chinese idioms. A total of 83 non&#8209;native novices who have attended the Chinese as Foreign Language Course in a local private university of Malaysia were selected as the research sample and divided into two groups. 43 participants were placed in the experimental group and studied the Chinese idioms with a developed multimedia storytelling prototype (MSP), whereas the other 40 participants in the conventional teaching group learned the new knowledge through traditional storytelling. A Chinese idiom test and survey questionnaires were distributed to the non&#8209;native novices to examine their learning achievement and preferences towards the learning approaches. Results showed that the students in the experimental group scored higher and had greater satisfaction towards the Chinese idiom learning than the learners from the conventional group.

Abstract:
This paper explores the design, development and evaluation of an early childhood literacy iPad application, focusing on the English Alphabet, called ‘A to Z Safari’ trialled in Australian classrooms. A to Z Safari was designed to assist students in the early years of schooling with learning the alphabet and building on their knowledge of letter&#8209;sounds. This paper details the process that led to the design and development of A to Z Safari and evaluates the success of the application (also known as 'app'), using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), from a classroom trial in 2015. Quantitative data from the app statistics gathered on student use, and qualitative interviews with classroom teachers explores how students and teachers received A to Z Safari. It was found that the design of A to Z Safari exhibited ease of use and usefulness for the target cohort in regards to gameplay and teacher support, however a number of updates need to be made to the app’s functionality to satisfy future, larger scale use. Suggestions for those designing similar apps for use in classroom environments have been provided.

Abstract:
The more the students get experienced with technologies, the more the need for tertiary education systems to adopt innovative pedagogical strategies for accommodating different learning needs. Depending on students’ prior experience with computer&#8209;based tools, they may have different degrees of familiarity with new technologies. At University of Rwanda (UR), for example, the familiarity and experience with technology for incoming students is not clearly known. Universities need to understand this phenomenon for efficient education planning and management. Therefore, this study aims to understand the degree of familiarity with technology for first&#8209;year students at the University of Rwanda. Accessibility, ownership, usage and previous computer&#8209;based training are used in this study’ conceptual framework as factors that determine the degree of familiarity with technology. Firstly, results indicate that the majority of participants are not familiar with technology and never had any previous exposure to eLearning systems. Secondly, regarding the digital tools, while smartphones are the most accessed, owned and used tools by respondents, they rarely or never used them for learning activities. Thirdly, findings portrayed a heterogeneous technology experience with a substantial variation of access, use, ownership and previous training on new technologies among the sample. Strategies for improving experience and confidence with technology, for first&#8209;year students, are recommended for this institution. This will prepare new students for early technology uptake and readiness while empowering them to develop appropriate competencies and skills for the digital age. Further studies in the area of experience with technology are also proposed.

A Literature Review of the Factors Influencing E&#8209;Learning and Blended Learning in Relation to Learning Outcome, Student Satisfaction and Engagement

Abstract:
In higher education, e&#8209;learning is gaining more and more impact, especially in the format of blended learning, and this new kind of traditional teaching and learning can be practiced in many ways. Several studies have compared face&#8209;to&#8209;face teaching to online learning and/or blended learning in order to try to define which of the formats provides, e.g., the highest learning outcome, creates the most satisfied students or has the highest rate of course completion. However, these studies often show that teaching and learning are influenced by more than teaching format alone. Many factors play significant roles, and this literature review will look further into some of them.The review has a special interest in professional bachelor education and teacher training, and it focusses on factors that influence learning experiences in e&#8209;learning, online learning and blended learning. Thus, the research question of the review is as follows: Which factors are found to influence e&#8209;learning and blended learning in relation to learning outcome, student satisfaction and engagement in collaboration in higher education and particularly in professional education? The findings from the research papers included in the review show that among the many factors some seem to dominate more: educator presence in online settings, interactions between students, teachers and content, and designed connections between online and offline activities as well as between campus&#8209;related and practice&#8209;related activities. The article thus points in the direction of some significant factors, but it also discusses and questions the relevance of research focusing on comparisons between individual formats of e&#8209;learning, online learning, blended learning or "traditional" face&#8209;to&#8209;face teaching and learning. Teaching and learning are complex and are influenced by more than just the teaching format. The review is based on systematic database searches conducted in January 2017, and it includes 44 peer reviewed articles and papers published between 2014 and 2017.

Beyond Stalemate: Seeking Solutions to Challenges in Online and Blended Learning Programs
Pages:
pp56&#8209;66
Authors:
Paula Charbonneau-Gowdy
Abstract:
Concerned calls for more empirical research in the area of fully or blended online learning approaches have yet to be heeded. The concern is not unwarranted given that most higher learning institutions worldwide are moving increasingly to partial or complete online course offerings. Our own work in this area has been directed at uncovering challenges in Virtual Learning Environments (VLE’s), particularly those related to participatory issues that are being recognized in educational scholarship from a sociocultural perspective as the essence of successful learning, regardless of the field. The high stakes involved in learners´ proactive and critical participation in knowledge building through social interaction online, as opposed to passive assimilation, are closely connected to effective programs and their desired outcomes. We have argued that understanding the barriers that prevent these participatory practices involves a multifaceted perspective, including the voices of learners, and importantly, teaching practitioners. The significant quantitative and qualitative data we have generated in the different phases of our longitudinal inquiry using case study methodology have revealed disturbing challenges in the programs. These issues are primarily rooted in the degree of active participation on the part of many learners, especially in essential social interactive practices and this despite the commitment, enthusiasm and support of instructors for the VLE modality. Yet without significant student engagement and responsive participation not only are learning goals jeopardized, but so too is the underlying cost structure that often is assumed to support such programs. We are left with seeking a way forward. To do so, in this paper, we apply the investigative work we have done to emerging frameworks for evaluating these online programs. Our aim is to uncover a clear and evidenced&#8209;based argument for solutions to offer to key stakeholders and concrete steps they can take for improving their blended modality program offerings. The results of this exercise we believe provide an accessible roadmap for action for the large&#8209;scale online program in our investigation and new insight for online learning more broadly.

Navigational Acts and Discourse: Fostering Learner Agency in Computer&#8209;Assisted Language Learning

pp67&#8209;76
Authors:

Elena Barbera
Abstract:
Fostering learner agency is a primary goal of Integrative Computer Assisted Language Learning, a type of CALL (Warschauer, 1996) that encompasses networked learning and multimedia, including hypermedia. Although navigation has been a focus of attention in some more established CALL scenarios such as Intelligent Computer Assisted Language learning (ICALL) systems in second language acquisition (SLA) research, much less focus has been on more emerging CALL scenarios such as augmented reality, amongst others. Therefore, if learner agency is to be fostered, identifying how it manifests is important.  This study focuses on ‘directional agency’ (Knight, Barberà and Appel, 2017) which is agency exercised in relation to navigational acts during language learning tasks. Using our own case study data as a starting point (where learners carry out navigation as part of the tasks), the paper draws attention to the somatic acts of navigation while using spoken language as part of the multimodal experiences learners can face. A specific literature review was carried out on other current and emerging CALL scenarios that were considered as cases in order to survey the presence of intentional navigational acts and talk, explore and understand it as a phenomenon in the field and to refine directional agency as a construct. Results suggest that directional agency is present across other CALL scenarios and task types; directional agency can be shared across learners and technological features; there are multiple forms of navigation including embodied navigation and whole or partial human body navigation that can occurr in the same task. Navigational acts can accompany learner&#8209;learner talk and they can also form part of learner&#8209;computer ‘talk’. Learners and computers can act as “semiotic initiators and responders” (Coffin and Donohue, 2014), resembling sequential turn&#8209;taking of talk so that both learners and digital technologies can be understood as potential actors in the task discourse.

Abstract:
Abstract: The thesis component of a degree program is vital since the quality of it contributes to the quality of the whole degree. Maintaining the quality of the degree programs and handling the constantly increasing numbers of students entering higher education simultaneously is a challenge for many higher educational institutions. This paper presents a study of how ICT can be used to improve the quality and effectiveness of the thesis projects at Bachelors and Masters Levels.  Further, how the blended model of supervision supports solving the issues of managing supervisor time efficiently and providing a quality guidance for thesis students are also explored. Supervisors’ perceptions of the ICT enabled thesis process are captured via interviews. Statistics about the completed theses and the user log data of the ICT system are triangulated to complement supervisor perceptions. Results revealed that the supervisors take advantage of the functions in the system to support improving the quality and the quantity of the theses, and the blended supervision model adapted in the thesis process support the supervisors to have a better collaboration with the students.

Abstract:
The objective of the research was to determine the effect that a metacognitive scaffolding for Web information searches exercises on the development of school students, through a general chemistry course in a blended learning modality. One hundred and four students from a school of the city of Bogotá D.C.&#8209;Colombia participated in the study. The research followed a quasi&#8209;experimental design with a pretest and posttest. Three tenth&#8209;grade groups, previously established, worked with a b&#8209;learning environment with three versions: the first group worked with a fixed scaffolding, the second with an optional scaffolding, and the third group interacted with a b&#8209;learning environment without any type of scaffolding whatsoever. The Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (MAI) test was used to measure metacognitive abilities before and after data treatment. To analyze the data, a Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) was conducted, which showed that the fixed scaffolding favors the development of metacognitive abilities, especially those related to procedural knowledge, planning, organization, monitoring, and evaluation. This tool, possibly based on the analysis and reflection of their own performance in task development, allowed students to consolidate structured strategies in Web information searches. In contrast, the use of the optional scaffolding did not exhibit the expected results since it was not used by a high percentage of students. These findings, among others, are discussed in the study.

Abstract:
A technology supported environment in the educational context has been identified as a useful work space with the potential to deepen the learning experience. This study focuses on ways of using it for the development of reflection as a key teaching competence within initial teacher training. It is based on the premise that enriched reflection conducted in a technology supported environment will result in more a specific, more profound and thus deeper learning experience of student teachers. The purpose of this study was to measure the level of depth of the reflection conducted in a regular higher education ELT methodology course after a microteaching session and to compare it with the reflection student teachers provided after their experience had been enriched by other classmates´ suggestions within VLE. The study was conducted over 2 semesters and the research sample consisted of 52 undergraduate students. Non&#8209;probability sampling was applied, namely convenience sampling. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used including content analysis and semi&#8209;structured focus&#8209;group interviews. To increase the internal validity and objectivity in coding the responses and data interpretation multiple researchers were used. The results of the current study suggest that enriched reflection provided student teachers with such a depth of stimuli that their approach towards their own reflection demonstrated a significant difference in comparison with regular reflection conducted in face to face learning.

Abstract:
Educational technology (ed tech) coaches can help teachers and students integrate iPad affordances into their teaching and learning. A brief overview of affordance theory is provided. While investigating the under&#8209;researched practices of ed tech coaches, the authors identified iPad affordances and tabulated these, revealing links between the iPad’s technological capabilities, technological affordances and pedagogical affordances. Nine iPad technological capabilities, such as the camera, were aligned with some of their technological affordances, such as taking a photo. These were matched to some pedagogical affordances, such as taking a photo for educational purposes. Finally, different categories in the table were combined into six broad strands unveiling how ed tech coaches use them to change teacher pedagogy with benefits for teachers, students and parents. Ed tech coaches often naturally build teachers’ TPACK, mostly through the SAMR model. Specifically, they change teachers’ pedagogy by focusing on polysynchronous teaching and learning; digital, transformed learning; student ownership of learning with teachers as facilitators; students as teachers of content and technology; teachers’ triple agendas of content elaboration, academic argument, and digital citizenship; and student creativity.

Abstract:
As the power of Learning Management System (LMS) in supporting classroom instruction has been observed in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), only few has been documented in military environment using this kind of learning technology. This paper is the first attempt to investigate the satisfaction of air force officers on the use of Squadron Officer Course Virtual Classroom (SOCVC) in the Philippines. The popular Modular Object&#8209;Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment (MOODLE) was used to implement the SOCVC. A total of 47 Philippine Air Force (PAF) officers enrolled in the SOC participated in this study. Satisfaction in terms of learner interface, learning community, content and usefulness on the use of SOCVC was obtained using a questionnaire. The respondents are seen comfortable and satisfied with the use of the virtual classroom. Profile variables used in the study when taken separately do not show significant difference as to the respondents’ satisfaction on the use of the virtual classroom. The findings oppose what are already established pertaining to the variables that affect the use of Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) in civilian setting.

Abstract:
The revolution in technology has led to new approaches toward open and distance learning, particularly in the form of e&#8209;learning. E&#8209;learning governs the system of modern education by using Information and Communication Technology (ICT). There are different design approaches and interpretations of e&#8209;learning, primarily involving variations in instructional strategies and pedagogical models employed with the technology. These innovations offer compelling opportunities to educational institutions, students and faculty alike, yet they have also posed formidable challenges for e&#8209;learning.  This is especially the case in the developing countries. This paper engages the concept and aims of e&#8209;learning with regard to the issues in the developing countries. The next part of the paper presents the need of e&#8209;learning in Pakistan and describes the major institutes offering e&#8209;learning and distance education as an alternate mode of education. The paper also elaborates major challenges of e&#8209;learning and explores the influencing factors for the adoption of e&#8209;learning in Pakistan. The important factors are investigated in terms of available ICT infrastructure and other country specific parameters. The paper also presents results of a survey that was conducted to evaluate students’ preferences regarding e&#8209;learning. The survey result demonstrates a strong preference for e&#8209;learning by the students. The paper concludes by presenting a generalized model of e&#8209;learning that can fulfill the needs of leaners under available technology infrastructure.

Abstract:
This explanatory sequential study investigated secondary school principals’ perceptions on barriers regarding the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) integration in a developing country, Indonesia. For the quantitative phase, we administered a survey instrument to 250 Indonesian secondary school principals. The survey instrument was developed based on previous related literature validated through content validity and piloted before being distributed. Following the quantitative process, three Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with 30 participants were conducted to obtain more in&#8209;depth information. Each FGD was attended by 10 participants. The findings revealed that the most highly identified barriers are teachers’ knowledge of ICT, funding for ICT, traditional teaching style, professional development, as well as district and school culture. Recommendations are offered for the improvement of technology integration for educational purpose.

Abstract:
In recent years, research using learning analytics to predict learning outcomes has begun to increase. This emerging field of research advocates the use of readily&#8209;available data to inform teaching and learning. The current case study adopts a learning analytics approach to evaluate the online learning package of an academic English course in a university in Hong Kong. This study aims to (1) explore the completion pattern of use of the online learning package by students in a generic undergraduate academic skills course; and (2) predict student outcomes based on their online behaviour patterns. Over three academic years, the study examined usage logs for 7000+ students that were available on the university’s learning management system. Student assessment component scores, online activity completion rates, and online behavioural patterns were identified and examined using descriptive analysis, bivariate correlation analysis, and multiple regression analysis. The findings reveal insights into different online learning behavioural patterns that would benefit blended course designers. For instance, some students started using the online learning package early in the semester but fulfilled only the minimum required online work, whereas others greatly exceeded the basic requirement and continued doing activities in the online package even after the semester had finished. The relationship between learning activities in the online package and assessment component grades was found to be weak but meaningful. A regression model was developed drawing on the completion rates to predict overall student scores, and this model successfully identified several specific factors, such as total number of attempts and performance in individual online learning activities, as predictors of the final course grade.

Abstract:
Use and development of applications for smartphones (so&#8209;called ‘apps’) continue to rise, and it comes as no surprise that language learning apps (such as Google Translate) are immensely popular among the younger generation. But, do these apps actual help students learn a language and, if so, how is apps usage influenced by the proficiency of the language learner?  Our research focused on the use of apps related to language learning in two major Korean universities. Koreans are known to be high&#8209;tech users and avid language learners, and Korea can therefore provide a good model for how education and technology intersect. We asked students studying German, Swahili, Hausa, and Zulu to inform us about the role that smartphone apps play in their language learning, both at home and in a formal education setting (e.g., classroom). Results showed that one important determiner for how apps were used was language proficiency. We further found an interaction effect between proficiency in English and the other languages, which directly impacted app use. Our findings suggest that these rather sophisticated digital and language learning students make sophisticated choices of apps based on knowledge of apps and the language learning task at hand.

Abstract:
With the increasing strategic importance of Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) in higher education, this paper offers an innovative approach to advancing discussions and practice around MOOC learning design, in the context of staff development. The study provides a deeper understanding of staff (academic and learning technologists') experience when designing MOOCs, through the evaluation of a novel MOOC design mapping framework (MDMF) at one higher education institution. The MDMF was developed to enhance the MOOC design process for staff involved, providing dedicated, tailored support in this area. This study considers and contributes to the literature on learning design, differences between face&#8209;to&#8209;face and online learning and the role played by academic staff and learning technologists in the design of MOOCs. The study is based on rich qualitative data drawn from 12 semi&#8209;structured interviews with nine academics and three learning technologists who used the framework for constructing MOOCs. This study evaluates: (1) how the framework was used and supported; (2) benefits of the framework to support good practice in learning design and the design process; and (3) limitations of the framework. We also considered suggested enhancements to the framework. The study highlighted new areas that could influence the design process, such as the importance of the learning technologist as a facilitator of the MDMF, the benefits of the visual aspects of the framework, technological challenges, and users’ level of digital literacy.

Abstract:
The use of dynamic geometry computer software (DGCS) is important in educational environment, and it is more advantageous for learning mathematics comprehensively. This study examined the importance of dynamic geometry computer software on learners’ performance in geometry. A quasi experimental, non&#8209;equivalent control group was used. The instrument used in this study was geometry achievement mathematics test (GMAT) that comprised 15 multiple choices items. The GMAT was administered to 87 grade nine learners in two secondary schools in Tshwane south district, Gauteng Province South Africa. One school was used as experimental group and the second school was used as the control group. Data analysis employed the use of the statistical t&#8209;test independent sample. The result of the study shows that using DGCS is important in geometry whereby it improves the performance of learners. In addition, the results show that the software affects the female learners’ mathematics performances more positively than the male learners. Hence, the results of this study showed that there is great potential in using the DGCS (GeoGebra) to teach secondary schools mathematics. The study recommends that the use of technology in teaching and learning of mathematics should be a priority in the schools.

Abstract:
Life&#8209;long learning is currently being embraced as a central process that could disrupt traditional educational paths. Apparently, the (ideal) type of learning often promoted is deep and meaningful learning, though it is not always required to be so. Deep learning goes beyond superficial knowledge assimilation of unlinked facts; it aims at developing deep disciplinary understanding, transformative knowledge, personal meaning, emotional intelligence, critical thinking, creativity and metacognitive skills. Meaningful learning occurs when learning is active, constructive, intentional, authentic, and cooperative. Technology enhanced teaching and learning methods should prove their potential to transform life&#8209;long learning provision and facilitate the achievement of deep and meaningful learning. In the context of distance education in life&#8209;long learning, one important challenge is the design of versatile quality assurance strategies for e&#8209;training. Based on the experiences in distance lifelong learning programmes in the University of Patras’ Educational Center for Life&#8209;Long Learning (KEDIVIM) the authors present how the principles and attributes of deep and meaningful learning can be combined with project management in practice and be incorporated in an e&#8209;Learning quality strategy. We present i) the methods used to assess the quality of the e&#8209;Learning programmes, ii) key findings of the evaluation process and iii) first research evaluation results on the quality of learning. This research study on learning process quality was conducted by using an online questionnaire, which aimed at estimating the level of participants’ satisfaction while using interactive learning methods such as collaborative learning. Some results of the evaluation indicate that the e&#8209;Learning quality strategy led to e&#8209;Learning programmes that used active learning methods to achieve high learners’ satisfaction towards deep and meaningful learning.

Abstract:
In the traditional lab setting, it is reasonably straightforward to monitor student learning and provide ongoing feedback. Such formative assessments can help students identify their strengths and weaknesses, and assist faculty to recognize where students are struggling and address problems immediately. But in an online virtual lab setting, formative assessment has challenges that go beyond space&#8209;time synchrony of online classroom. As we see increased enrollment in online courses, learning science needs to address the problem of formative assessment in online laboratory sessions. We developed a student team learning monitor (STLM module) in an electronic health record system to measure student engagement and actualize the social constructivist approach of Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL). Using iterative Plan&#8209;Do&#8209;Study&#8209;Act cycles in two undergraduate courses over a period of two years, we identified critical components that are required for online implementation of POGIL. We reviewed published research on POGIL classroom implementations for the last ten years and identified some common elements that affect learning gains. We present the critical components that are necessary for implementing POGIL in online lab settings, and refer to this as Cyber POGIL. Incorporating these critical components are required to determine when, how and the circumstances under which Cyber POGIL may be successfully implemented. We recommend that more online tools be developed for POGIL classrooms, which evolve from just providing synchronous communication to improved task monitoring and assistive feedback.

Abstract:
Pre&#8209;service teachers frequently express negative prejudices towards science and the methodologies traditionally used during their training. Gamification is a booming technology based on combining the psychological aspects, mechanics and dynamics of a game in non&#8209;ludic environments. The use of gamification has shown good outcomes in terms of increasing students´ motivation towards the sciences. In this study, new laboratory practices were developed under the umbrella of gamification methodology for pre&#8209;service teachers. The general objectives were to eliminate negative prejudices, fear and rejection attitudes towards science, to foster the conceptual and procedural learning of science among students and to provide students with real&#8209;life examples and an experience of applying gamification themselves. First, the theoretical basis of the main components and dynamics of gamification in the Education context are summarized. Secondly, their application in a specific subject from the curriculum for the Teaching Training in Primary Education degree (Didactics of Natural Science (DNS), 3rd year) are presented. The methodology was applied twice in laboratory practice in two consecutive academic years: 2017/2018 (5 groups, 150 students ) and 2018/2019 (6 groups, 183 students) . The steps, dynamics, components and the tools used for the gamification experience are described (i.e. Kahoot, Class Dojo). Several pre and post&#8209;tests were carried out to explore: (i) the students’ relationship with games; (ii) their preferred role as players; (iii) their assessment of the different elements involved in the gamification methodology; (iv) their motivation towards science laboratories attitude and (v) their  self&#8209;perception with regards to their newly acquired skills to put gamification into practice in their professional future.

Exploring the Potential of the Learning Designer as a Teacher Support Tool

Abstract:
This paper reports on a study carried out with pre&#8209;service teachers who first developed a course by designing it in a Learning Design (LD) tool and then implemented it as a course in Moodle. The research explores the potential of the Learning Designer, the LD tool utilized in the study, by addressing three aspects of the LD tool’s added value for teachers as designers: a) the development of a learning design, b) the reflection on a design and c) the usefulness of the LD process using an LD tool towards the implementation of a design in a Learning Management System (LMS). The findings suggest that the graphical representation of a learning design provided by the LD tool supports designers to structure learning activities. The components of a learning design incorporated in the LD tool such as the learning outcomes, the type of a learning activity according to a typology and how learners are organized scaffold the articulation of the pedagogy of a learning design. Moreover, the pre&#8209;service teachers requested more components e.g. for organizing technology&#8209;enhanced learning and more customizable features e.g. for defining and combining activity types.  All means of design analysis, especially the graphical ones trigger the designers’ reflection on the nature of the activities included in a learning design and provoke them to improve it. The pre&#8209;service teachers perceived as beneficial the LD process in the Learning Designer towards considering components of the learning design which are applicable in its implementation as a course in an LMS. Nevertheless, difficulties were reported concerning non&#8209;matching and missing components leading to the reconsideration of aspects of the original design during the implementation. The conclusions drawn from the study’s findings reveal the potential of the Learning Designer to support teachers as designers and are of value both to researchers involved with developing LD tools and to practitioners interested in harnessing an LD tool to promote LD practices.

Title:
Driving High Inclination to Complete Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs): Motivation and Engagement Factors for Learners

Abstract:
Today, online learning is prospering from the widely available and easily accessible connection to the Web. Massive open online course (MOOC) platforms such as Coursera, edX, and Udemy have made available several thousands of short courses at several difficulty levels in a wide variety of disciplines, ranging from business, computer science to literature, for learners to select from. Learners who are looking to earn credentials for career advancement or personal interest would find MOOCs attractive not only because of the time and place flexibility these courses offer, but also because of the free enrollment or the very small certificate fee upon completion, as well as the emergent recognition these courses are receiving for their high quality learning delivery from leading educational institutions. Learners who enroll in a MOOC would typically need to participate in various learning activities and complete a few assessment tasks to complete the course. However, it has been commonly reported that the completion rates of MOOCs are low. Based on the common notion that when learners are more motivated to learn, they are likely to better engage in learning and have a higher likelihood to complete a MOOC, this study adopted the Motivation and Engagement Scale (MES) by Martin (2007, 2009) to collect responses from university students to examine whether positive motivation resulted in positive engagement; whether negative motivation resulted in negative engagement; and how positive or negative engagement swayed learners’ inclination to complete a MOOC if they were to enroll in one. Findings show that there was a statistically significant positive relationship between positive motivation and positive engagement, between negative motivation and negative engagement, and between positive engagement and inclination to complete a MOOC. However, the relationship between negative engagement and inclination to complete a MOOC was statistically not significant. Findings of this study can be useful to MOOC providers and learners in their effort to develop strategies to increase completion rates of MOOCs.

3&#8209;M Model for Uncovering the Impact of Multi&#8209;level Identity Issues on Learners’ Social Interactive Engagement Online

Abstract:
Abstract: A growing trend in higher education institutions (HE) to move course offerings to Blended Learning (BL) modes is challenging many of our traditional views and practices of teaching and learning. Part of the problem is that many of those working within these institutions at the macro, meso and micro levels have stubbornly resisted abandoning the view that knowledge is imparted by the institution and that knowledge is consumed by students. Advances in technology have upturned this positionality as learners and institutions alike realize that roles are evolving in the process of education. Tracking the scholarship on BL, for example, reveals a major issue preventing successful learning outcomes is reticence on the part of learners to be socially interactive and engaged online. Through the lens of socialcultural and identity theories and a conceptualization of engagement being composed of behavioural, emotional and cognitive components, this paper aims to respond to a call for greater insight into this pressing issue. With findings from a recent qualitative longitudinal study of a BL program in a large private&#8209;for&#8209;profit university in Chile we unravel the complex social psychological aspects that contribute to learners’ willingness, or unwillingness, to engage in interacting with others and with content online – an essential determinant of successful learning and quality BL programs. A critical discussion of the findings from multiple qualitative data sources reveals that the general lack of undergraduate students’ incentive to develop agency and adopt empowered learner identities characteristic of active participators online, is strongly influenced by the assumed or imposed identities of teachers, academic leaders and institutional decision makers that create a climate that fails to nurture community building in these contexts. Abundant evidence suggests a model for BL in HE that could lead to decisive, strategic and coordinated action at each level and measurable improvement in student online learning engagement and outcomes.

Abstract:
Abstract: Educational practices are constantly adjusting to technological advances, in order to improve their effectiveness in delivering knowledge and preparing students for  the challenges of modern digital society. Electronic games and augmented reality environments are two such media that can shape powerful modes of interactive and immersive experiences. Audio games in particular, i.e. electronic games that utilise data sonification and audio interaction techniques to express all narrative and gameplay content, have been proven to enhance players’ skills, such as concentration, memory, fantasy, emotional response, perception, data management and cooperation. However, despite the promising research findings reported in literature, there has been no systematic approach in integrating systems based on audio interaction into formal education. This article suggests that audio games can be designed and implemented for the delivery of targeted curricula through an engaging learning experience, whereas fusing audio game mechanics into new interactive technologies, such as augmented reality environments, will further enhance the students’ immersiveness in the learning process. Towards establishing the theoretical framework for the design of educational audio games, as well as educational augmented reality audio games, the authors review existing approaches and argue that the inherent features of both audio interaction and augmented reality systems agree with the official educational goals formulated by the Greek Ministry of Education and the International Baccalaureate Institution. Then, they discuss four original projects in terms of sound and mechanics design to demonstrate that audio games can address a wide range of subjects, adopt cross&#8209;curricular strategies, facilitate complex modes of interaction, and realise creative, collaborative and inclusive learning activities.

A Use Case of the Application of Advanced Gaming and Immersion Technologies for Professional Training: The GAMEPHARM Training Environment for Physiotherapists
Pages:

Abstract:
Immersive technologies are gaining momentum in professional training.  Advanced AR/VR and gaming technologies allow for authentic learning experiences that are close to real&#8209;life conditions, problems, and applications, something that can revolutionise fields like medical training, which traditionally relied on textbook&#8209;based theoretical education and clinical placements. The present paper discusses the application of advanced gaming and immersion technologies for the continuous training of physiotherapists. Presently, this professional group remains largely underserved by online training services. The paper argues that the inherent complexity of physical therapy training could be served effectively by immersive learning innovations and professionals could benefit greatly.  The paper applies the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) to design a suitable training solution for the promotion of authentic, comprehensive learning. Our analysis targets and consolidates the findings from three distinct pillars: (a) the requirements of the application area in question; (b) the current state&#8209;of&#8209;the&#8209;art and emerging directions in game&#8209;based professional education and training; and (c) existing applications of game&#8209;based learning in the field of healthcare. Subsequently, the paper consolidates the findings to produce the system requirements and presents the design of a prototype training environment for physiotherapists that builds on advanced gaming technologies. Within the proposed system design, augmented reality modules are embedded alongside the game simulation and virtual world environment to provide participants with an authentic simulated game scenario in which to immerse themselves.

Abstract:
This paper presents the formulated ‘play&#8209;to&#8209;engage’ model for indigenous community engagement that incorporates factors in cultural protocols and game design thinking. The hybrid model of the participatory co&#8209;creation model was formulated in the study that had been rolled out in two rural primary schools in West Borneo. These schools are located in remote villages, away from urban amenities, and technological affordances and resources are limited. There are more than twenty culturally&#8209;diversed indigenous tribes in Borneo. Although it is a known fact that indigenous cultures, including those in Borneo, have many cultural protocols and distinctive custom practices, it is still a challenge for researchers who work with such communities to understand, adhere to and follow the cultural protocols. The model looks at incorporating gameplay and culture protocols to drive community engagement. Since play is universal, the creation of a trustworthy partnership between the community and researchers was established through the use of play during the engagement process. Narratives captured in the study represented reflection, problem solving and creativity in the interactions with the indigenous communities, based on the developed indicators of the ‘play&#8209;to&#8209;engage’ model.

Abstract:
This article discusses the application of game design thinking as a learning process for scaffolding co&#8209;creativity in Higher Education based on the GameChangers initiative (gamify.org.uk) part&#8209;funded by the Higher Education Funding Council of England (HEFCE).  Taking into account the relationship between play, technology and learning, the game design thinking approach fully embraces and accommodates for the creation and development of games of any typology (board games, card games, digital games, etc.)  and playful solutions (gamified products) as freely chosen by the learners, aligning with the importance of autonomy, relatedness and purpose in motivating learners to be deeply engaged in the process. Through this process, learners are expected to gain valuable knowledge in creative and collaborative problem solving and experience game design and development process towards addressing real challenges and opportunities in their communities. The focus of the process is on the creative process rather than the end products/solutions produced by the learners. The paper will specifically discuss the methodology and findings from an experimental module developed based on the approach involving four cohorts of Level two undergraduate students (n=122, 2017&#8209;2019). The students came from the different schools and faculties at Coventry University, UK. Based on the qualitative feedback and reflections collected through the Module Evaluation Questionnaire (MEQ) and the final reflection pieces, the co&#8209;creative process inspired by play and games demonstrates that through the process, students discover the importance of elements such as empathy, purpose, meaning, art, creativity and teamwork in their learning regardless of the specific disciplines they are pursuing.

Abstract:
We consider game design as a sociocultural and knowledge modelling activity, engaging participants in the design of a scenario and a game universe based on a real or imaginary socio&#8209;historical context, where characters can introduce life narratives and interaction that display either known social realities or entirely new ones. In this research, participants of the co&#8209;creation activity are Malaysian students who were working in groups to design game&#8209;based learning resources for rural school children. After the co&#8209;creativity activity, the students were invited to answer the co&#8209;creativity scale, an adapted version of the Assessment Scale of Creative Collaboration (ASCC), combining both the co&#8209;creativity factors and learners’ experiences on their interests, and difficulties they faced during the co&#8209;creativity process. The preliminary results showed a high diversity on the participants’ attitudes towards collaboration, especially related to their preferences towards individual or collaborative work.

The Gameplay Loop Methodology as a Tool for Educational Game Design
Pages:
pp207&#8209;221
Authors:
André Czauderna
Emmanuel Guardiola
Abstract:
The field of game design for educational content lacks a focus on methodologies that merge gameplay and learning. Existing methodologies typically fall short in three ways: they neglect the unfolding of gameplay through players’ actions over a short period of time as a significant unit of analysis; they lack a common consideration of game and learning mechanics; and they falsely separate the acts of playing and learning. This paper recommends the gameplay loop methodology as a valuable tool for educational game design, as it addresses these major shortcomings. Furthermore, this paper outlines how this methodology can be supported by knowledge from subject&#8209;specific didactics—considering both the curriculum and its mediation (contributed by experts from educational practice) as well as methods of player&#8209;centered design—in order to ensure the appropriateness of learning objectives and techniques of mediation in the context of a particular field of knowledge, the game’s appeal to its target group, and the effectiveness of the learning mechanics. A case study of the design and production phases of Antura and the Letters, a literacy game for Arabic refugee children, illustrates the uses of the gameplay loop methodology situated in the described broader approach to educational game design. Finally, this paper explains the results of an impact study revealing that the approach indeed provides the opportunity to merge playing and learning.

Abstract:
In this paper, we present the project, Community Drive, as well as the theoretical and empirical background on which the project is based. Through technical and humanistic collaboration, the project aims to create models that allow children and young people to participate in overcoming future challenges in cities by becoming active and contributing participants in research and development efforts. Further, the project contributes knowledge about community&#8209;driven game tools, user&#8209;driven big data and the Internet of Things and their connection with intelligent and socially responsible urban development. The project is conducted in cooperation with the city of Copenhagen, local schools and Aalborg University. Community Drive involves students, aged 10–13, attending schools in deprived neighbourhoods near Aalborg University Copenhagen in southern Copenhagen. This area is characterised by a high rate of unemployment, low income and residents with little or no education. As a result, resources have been allocated for reconditioning the subsidised housing in this area. In this paper, we discuss the ways in which Community Drive, initiated in May 2018, is based on the results of pilot projects conducted from 2014 to 2017. Overall, these studies showed that tasking students with changing their living conditions by redesigning their neighbourhoods is a strong motivational factor. During the redesign process, students were able to construct game&#8209;based models of various residents’ needs and argue for redesigns based on their knowledge about the area and the ability of certain designs to fulfil the needs of various groups of residents living in the area. We also present initial results from collaboration workshops between schools and professional external local partners. These results show that three themes are central for the collaboration process:  building local contact, meaningful local ownership and real challenges and applicable solutions.

Abstract:
The aim of this case study was to evaluate whether there had been educational changes and if so, in which phases of implementation and institutionalization in three African higher education institutions. The changes were evaluated from the point&#8209;of&#8209;view of trainees in the field of e&#8209;learning and library services during the project conducted in 2013&#8209;2015. Written texts and visual material were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The enthusiasm and mutual pedagogical understanding of the academic and support service staff were the key factors promoting the changes in the integration of e&#8209;learning and modern library services into everyday practices in these higher education institutions. The provision of suitable training and pedagogic skills to the academics and the support service staff made it possible dovetail these concepts to suit their home institution and provide them with a common language and value base that supported student learning.

Designing Questions for Research Design and Design Research in e&#8209;Learning
Pages:
pp13&#8209;24
Authors:
Johannes C. Cronje
Abstract:
This paper presents a model for developing research questions that are aligned to research aims for research design in e&#8209;learning. The model is proposed as a solution to the on&#8209;going problem of heterogeneity of research problems. The model is based on Burrell and Morgan’s four social paradigms, and integrates four research aims, namely, explore, explain, develop and describe; four design positions, namely, formalist, populist, functionalist and conventionist; and four pursuits of (hu)mankind, namely, virtue, value, power and knowledge. Four of Roode’s (1993) research questions are mapped onto each of the consolidated paradigms. The feasibility of the model was tested against eight papers in previous issues of this journal. Two questions drove the study: what are the paradigms in which the selected articles can be classified, and how are these paradigms aligned to the research aims and research questions? The model was found to be useful in aligning the implied research aims and research questions of the selected papers. The model is proposed as a useful tool for supervisors and novice researchers to assist with the development of integrated research aims and research questions. Further research will include the development of generic question stems that can be used as the first few words of the questions that correspond to each aim.

Medical Student Perceptions of Integration of a Customized Cloud Based Learning Operating System into Problem Based Learning Tutorials

Abstract:
Since its inception, the College of Medicine and Medical Sciences (CMMS) at the Arabian Gulf University (AGU) has adopted the problem based (PBL) pedagogy in Medicine relying on paper&#8209;based trigger material. However, delivery of such paper&#8209;based triggers during tutorial sessions was not optimal to promote medical student interactivity and engagement within tutorial sessions. As involvement of multimedia resources and tools in PBL are more valuable than simple print textual modes of learning and can have a positive impact on learning and knowledge integration, we aimed to digitize all our trigger material. Over the past three years CMMS has integrated after customization to PBL standards, the cloud&#8209;based operating system, UNIO into its problem&#8209;based learning (PBL) curriculum. The aim of UNIO integration was to digitize text triggers and enhance the quality of visual triggers in order to improve medical student interactivity and engagement within tutorial sessions. UNIO electronic platform was customized from a teacher&#8209;centered design to fit a PBL pedagogy. It was utilized to link student and tutor hardware within a group together for promoting interaction and collaborative learning. The effect of this teaching approach was evaluated from student responses to an in&#8209;house validated survey at the end of the fifth PBL module. Customization and integration of UNIO within the PBL curriculum resulted in an entirely paperless learning process. It created an integrated PBL system combining conventional text trigger in a digital form with digital media such as images, videos and other multimedia, while maintaining face&#8209;to&#8209;face setup. It also provided online and off &#8209;live access to content embedded at campus and open access to open source content online to both tutors and students. Results of the student satisfaction survey pointed to a predominantly neutral attitude towards integration of UNIO within our PBL tutorial sessions, but the item related to effectiveness of media triggers within UNIO received favorable responses from students. Further evaluation for a longer term is necessary for additional student feedback. Other forms of evaluation may be required in the aim of improvement and for justification of subsequent implementation of UNIO within our PBL curriculum.

Abstract:
The Studentische Poliklinik is Germany’s first student&#8209;run free clinic. Prior to fulfilling clinical obligations there, students must complete an extensive peer&#8209;assisted learning program (PAL). Due to capacity constraints, a web&#8209;based learning program involving virtual patients has been launched. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of Virtual Patient Learning (VPL) vs. PAL in the acquisition of basic medical knowledge and skills. Forty undergraduate medical students (m=9; f=31) in their third year were randomly assigned to either the PAL (n=20), or VPL (n=20). Short&#8209;term (after each seminar) and long&#8209;term learning retention (after completion of the electives) was measured using a validated theoretical test. Objective structured clinical examinations (OSCE) were used to assess practical knowledge.  Additionally, the course itself was evaluated. Differences in theoretical knowledge between students in the PAL and VPL existed over the short term (VPL median = 100%; PAL median = 80; p = 0.006), but not over the long term (VPL = 94.17; PAL = 95.62 %; p = 0.617). An assessment of practical skills showed no differences in OSCE scores between the two different groups (VPL = 79.30 %; PAL = 80.26 %; p = 0.141). Students assessed their learning experience and the comprehensibility of seminars as either “very good” or “good”. Basic medical knowledge and skills can be taught as effectively using VPL as PAL. Given the cost&#8209;effectiveness, high reproducibility and freedom of time and place, VPL should be performed more often when teaching family medicine in student&#8209;run free clinics. Ultimately, this may result in enhanced treatment quality and patient satisfaction.

Abstract:
This study embarked on an in&#8209;depth content analysis of the information literacy environment in the South African education sector. The review of literature encompasses a comprehensive critical analysis of available appropriate and contemporary literature, which further expounds the research problem. This research adopted the qualitative method of data collection; hence, policy documents, conference proceedings and journal articles about the subject matter were analytically evaluated to identify whether there is a research gap that may have remained unanswered in previous studies. The study emphasises various ICT tools and techniques that will promote e&#8209;learning in South African educational sector; this was done in recognition of its essential role. South Africa struggles with challenges associated with the digital divide, a result of the inability of many to access ICT tools capable of enhancing their performance, particularly in a racially divided country such as South Africa, where a separate educational development policy was pursued during the apartheid era, in favour of the white minority. The trends in information literacy and essential issues regarding information literacy skills in South Africa are highlighted. The challenges associated with information literacy in South Africa are presented, and different opportunities in information literacy are also discussed. The paper concludes with the gaps and options in information literacy in South Africa. Finally, this paper offers a comprehensive review of the information literacy development in the South African education sector, which constitutes an essential perspective in the understanding of the global information literacy development

Abstract:
Educational games are now seen as effective learning tools. However, there is a gap in the literature regarding the core dimensions of Game&#8209;based learning (GBL) for comprehensive design, analysis, and evaluation due to inconsistent use of elements. The literature on GBL reports an extensive diversity of elements used for the design and evaluation of GBL without any categorization of micro and macro&#8209;level elements. Hardly any studies systematically decompose these aspects to derivate factors/sub&#8209;factors, obstructing identification of any clear pattern. The problem is not the scarcity of GBL research but inconsistency in terminology, scope, definition, and usage of elements leading to the absence of a holistic view of GBL for effective design and evaluation. This study bridges the gap by outlining terminology and scope with four conceptual levels and then systematically categorizing GBL elements by scope, definition, and usage. The methodology used is directed content analysis of GBL literature collected through a previous systematic literature review. Dimensionalization of GBL and further decomposition into factor/sub&#8209;factors based on theoretical constructs, has resulted in a consistent and clear pattern delineating the structure of the educational game design, analysis, and evaluation. Further codifying metrics and mapping the relationship among GBL dimensions deduce into a conceptual framework (called LEAGUÊ) that facilitates greater insight into the process of learning with educational games, where to focus and what to evaluate. The LEAGUÊ framework can be applied for the analysis, design and evaluation of learning games. The framework is put in practice by utilizing the framework components (dimensions, factors/sub&#8209;factors and relations) to develop three items: 1) an analysis instrument, 2)a card&#8209;based ideation and design toolkit, and 3) an evaluation guide that can assist educational game designers, researchers, educators and evaluators for the analysis, design and evaluation of learning games respectively. This paper exemplifies the application of framework for the analysis of learning games using the analysis instrument (developed using LEAGUÊ framework) with one case study as an example.

Abstract:
Digital and network society learning happens in new, timeless and borderless spaces. Such society members are always connected and online, sharing and co&#8209;creating knowledge, and their learning needs serve as the biggest driving forces for higher education curriculum change. Open online learning methodology seems to be the best&#8209;suited way to implement this change, in order to meet the needs of digital and network society. This research aims to investigate why and when open online learning is relevant for digital and network society and how open online learning supports curriculum change in higher education to meet the learning needs of digital and network society members. Theoretical research findings are discussed to: a) define the characteristics of digital and networked society, b) identify emerging ways of learning of a digital and networked society, and explain why open online learning is best suited for their needs, c) discuss the gap between the new ways of learning and higher education curricula and how open online learning is relevant for its change. Empirical research is based on global experts’ semi&#8209;structured interviews. The results of the research demonstrate that open online learning should serve as a solution for curriculum change in higher education to respond to digital and network society learning needs. Higher education curricula should change to ensure better flexibility, recognition of non&#8209;formal learning in formal curricula, better collaboration and exchange of people with diverse cultural and social experiences. Assessment and recognition of prior learning in the formal curricula of universities could be one of realistic scenarios for faster adaptation and introduction of more diversified learning paths. The research findings support the need to change the pedagogical approach from teacher&#8209;centred into a learner &#8209; centred, small&#8209;group orientated, multi&#8209;dimensional model of teaching, which raise further challenges and research dilemmas for academic community, in order to integrate important elements of change into university practices.

Abstract:
Current economy is driven by innovation and knowledge. Sharing economy is a new perspective on economics that impulses a new economy based on trust. In this article, the key components of global education business, based on the analysis of different types of business cases such as edX, Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, and Codecademy are established.For this research we carried out a systematic literature review based on different cases to highlight some of the main advantages of  the models of global education services based on sharing economy, as a result, we found out that the main components of the learning platform business model in sharing economy are related to the online cash concept, shared resources, shared knowledge access, networking collaboration, analysis based on big data, joint consumption, rather than ownership while the government loses monopolies of knowledge. Our claim is that global education will be supported by a collaborative consumption model based on the online cash concept, shared resources, and shared knowledge access.

Title:
Towards a New Definition of Blended Learning
Pages:
pp114&#8209;121
Authors:
Johannes Cronje
Abstract:
Most current definitions of blended learning refer to a blend of online and face&#8209;to&#8209;face instruction. It seems that few authors notice the irony that the definition of blended learning does not include the concept of learning at all. The problem with these definitions is that they are devoid of theory and thus lead to trial&#8209;and&#8209;error research. This paper argues that the definition of blended learning should be built around learning theory and should refer to a blend of direct instruction and learning&#8209;by&#8209;doing. The paper reports on research conducted to validate a model that puts behavioural and constructivist learning at right angles and considers if the two can occur simultaneously. The model is then placed in the context of a framework of knowledge management and from there a definition is derived that includes context, theory, methodology and technology.

Abstract:
Although xMOOCs have shown benefits due to their accessibility to expert knowledge, the quality of their pedagogical proposal remains contested. It has not yet been proven that online education’s learner&#8209;learner interaction practices in xMOOCs generate an improvement in the quality of learning and academic achievement. Peer feedback is a practice that can enhance learning in an environment with diverse student profiles and limited instructor participation. The present mixed methods study was devoted to identifying the perceptions of xMOOC participants regarding learner&#8209;learner interaction and feedback practices. In the Energy Saving course on MexicoX platform, 1,176 participants answered an initial survey, 486 participants answered a final survey and 14 participants were interviewed after completing the course. Results show that most of the participants are willing to interact with their peers and participate in peer feedback activities. Although, in practice its value for summative assessment is an important factor that may predict involvement. It is found that diversity of expertise level is not an obstacle for participants to interact. Rather, participants consider that they may benefit from diversity by assessing their peer assignments and learning different alternatives and strategies in which a problem can be solved. Further, it is identified that peer assessment activities are more adequate for providing feedback than discussion forums, since the first promotes an environment in which participants can observe the performance of their peers showed in a more complex assignment. The findings of this study allow us to analyse inherent and external factors that configure learner&#8209;learner interaction and that affect peer feedback in xMOOCs. It is concluded that more research is needed in order to understand the effect of some factors that may affect peer interaction and peer feedback in xMOOCs and to propose better strategies to improve peer feedback effectiveness.

Highlighting E&#8209;learning Adoption Challenges using data Analysis Techniques: University of Kufa as a Case Study

Abstract:
Electronic learning (e&#8209;learning) plays a significant role in improving the efficiency of the education process. However, in many cases in developing countries, technology transfer without consideration of technology acceptance factors has limited the impact of e&#8209;learning and the expected outcome of the education process. Therefore, this shift in learning method has been met with low enthusiasm from academic staff and students owing to its low perceived usefulness and perceived ease&#8209;of&#8209;use. The University of Kufa (UoK) in Iraq is considered a good case study because it has implemented the e&#8209;learning platform since 2013. The UoK platform is based on open&#8209;source Moodle owing to the latter’s advantages, such as low implementation cost, open community for support and continuous update and development. To identify and evaluate the challenges, this study uses a questionnaire survey that targets the level of adoption, implementation, familiarity and technology acceptance of staff and students. A total of 242 educators participate in the survey, and the data are subsequently analysed. Important information is extracted using data mining techniques, namely clustering and decision trees. One of the main crucial factors extracted from the analysis results is the perception that social media is easier to use compared with a dedicated e&#8209;learning platform such as Moodle. This factor may also discourage educators/learners from adopting an offered e&#8209;learning platform, regardless of actual usefulness, motivation and training programs. Therefore, this paper offers practical information regarding the main issues and a guideline to fully utilise e&#8209;learning for policy makers and e&#8209;learning developers, particularly in newly established institutions or developing countries.

e&#8209;Learning Challenges Faced by Universities in Kenya: A Literature Review
Pages:
pp150&#8209;161
Authors:
Rachael Njeri Kibuku

Abstract:
Some institutions of higher education in Kenya have adopted e&#8209;Learning with the aim of coping with the increased demand for university education and to widen access to university training and education. Though there are advantages that accrue from adopting e&#8209;Learning; its implementation and provision has not been smooth sailing. It has had to contend with certain national, organisational, technical and social challenges that undermine its successful implementation. This paper therefore aims to present a literature review of the challenges faced in the implementation and provision of e&#8209;Learning in universities in Kenya. The scoping review method was used to identify and analyze the literature of the e&#8209;Learning challenges. Some of the challenges revealed include: lack of adequate e&#8209;Learning policies, inadequate Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure, the ever evolving technologies, lack of technical and pedagogical competencies and training for e&#8209;tutors and e&#8209;learners, lack of an e&#8209;Learning theory to underpin the e&#8209;Learning practice, budgetary constraints and sustainability issues, negative perceptions towards e&#8209;Learning, quality issues, domination of e&#8209;Learning aims by technology and market forces and lack of collaboration among the e&#8209;Learning participants.  These challenges need to be addressed to minimise their impact on implementation and delivery of e&#8209;Learning initiatives in institutions of higher education in Kenya. This analysis of the e&#8209;Learning challenges forms the basis for the ongoing research that seeks to explore and establish possible strategies to address some of these challenges.

Abstract:
Thanks to the combination of face&#8209;to&#8209;face and online learning which involve the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), blended learning has become a popular approach to support learning in higher education. The main purpose of this study is to identify the teaching and instructional design approaches adopted by lecturers within blended learning environments, and to analyse their effects on students’ self&#8209;directed learning. The sample involves 18 lecturers and their undergraduate students (n= 294) undertaking a blended course in one French university. This research utilised a mixed method approach for data collection, including questionnaires and observations. Firstly, lecturers were invited to declare their teaching approaches and the configuration of their blended learning environments by completing two online questionnaires. Secondly, both face&#8209;to&#8209;face and online observations were conducted with the lecturers to identify the specificity of their instructional design activities. A pre&#8209;post questionnaire was also used to measure students’ self&#8209;directed learning level. Data collection took place over a period of 6 months during the academic year 2017&#8209;2018. The results show that lecturers who adopt student&#8209;centred teaching approaches are not necessarily designing their blended learning courses as a student&#8209;centred learning environment. Also, the results reveal that students' self&#8209;directed learning is significantly developed only in three out of seven student&#8209;centred blended learning courses. Additionally, the results show that lecturers of the students who improved their self&#8209;directed level provided online peer review and online forum discussion activities. The findings indicate that further research is needed both to validate the direct relationship between these kinds of pedagogical activities and the self&#8209;directed learning, and to determine how blended learning environments can better support collaboration and interaction.

Abstract:
As countless regional, national, and international accrediting bodies continue to employ student engagement measures as mechanisms for quality assurance, universities become more intent on achieving this important gauge of student success.  Specifically, the growth in enrollment in distance learning programs adds a unique level of complexity leading researchers to search for ways to increase engagement in the online course environment.  Organizations continue to value teamwork and many instructors have incorporated group work into their online courses to teach students this important skill.  The present study examines the impact of student engagement on group satisfaction.  Furthermore, this research places student engagement at the center of a structural equation model to determine both predictors and outcomes of this important element of student learning.  Specifically, this analysis examines whether students’ perceptions of computer self&#8209;efficacy impact student engagement and group satisfaction in online business courses.  Our findings indicate that computer self&#8209;efficacy leads to student engagement and, further, that student engagement influences group satisfaction.  Importantly, the relationship between student engagement and group satisfaction is mediated by group expectations.  Discussions   of findings can be utilized to understand the factors that lead to student engagement and its outcomes in online courses.

Abstract:
Institutions considering online and blended learning (OBL) face the challenge of strategically adopting OBL to develop, implement, monitor, assess and improve the quality of programmes and courses. The principles of continuous quality improvement (CQI) allow this challenge to be addressed. Effective CQI management implies that quality assurance and quality improvement follow and inform each other as part of a continuous cycle. Scholars report however, that quality management of OBL usually focuses on assurance. The purpose of this paper is to provide a state of the art approach for effective CQI management which allows practitioners to achieve coherence between quality assurance and improvement of OBL. In this conceptual paper we link and integrate work across fields to address the challenge of achieving coherence between quality assurance and improvement. We discuss research in the context of CQI that uncovers features of OBL that prevent practitioners from achieving coherence. The conceptual model for effective CQI of OBL integrates data based decision&#8209;making. The conceptual model provides a foundation for research on the effectiveness of this CQI management approach in the context of OBL. The quality management approach supports practitioners during the entire CQI&#8209;cycle to foster dialogue and consultation between all stakeholders in the institution in order to strategically develop assess and improve the quality of OBL programmes and courses. The originality of the model lies in making explicit data&#8209;based decision making as a driver for effective CQI management in the context of OBL.

Abstract:
Digital games have been successfully applied for the treatment mental health problems such as stress disorders, traumatic disorders, or hyperactivity syndromes. Specifically the treatment of anxiety traits and anxiety disorders such as phobias have been in the focus of game&#8209;based treatments in the past. A societal challenge that is increasing in recent times is media&#8209;induced fears in young children. While tailored game&#8209;based treatments existing for schoolchildren, tailored and theoretically sound solutions for children below the age of eight are sparse and so is the available body of empirical research in this direction. In this paper, we present a game&#8209;based training app (MARTY) for teaching young children to cope with their fears. The training is based on standard techniques for anxiety reduction such as breathing techniques and cognitive strategies. We investigated quantitative effects, measured by physiological values such as heart rate and skin resistance (EDA), and qualitative aspects of the MARTY app based on 17 four to six year olds. Overall, we found significant effects of the training on EDA values, as indicators for the arousal and anxiety level of children. No significant differences were found for heart rates. A key finding is that the training effects are positively correlated with the general anxiety level of children, as reported by their parents. The MARTY app may be a promising tool to guide and support parents and young children in reducing fears and anxieties.

Abstract:
This paper presents the design process of a Danish educational virtual reality (VR) application for alcohol prevention. Denmark is one on the countries in Europe with the highest alcohol consumption among adolescents. Alcohol abuse is a risk factor for a variety of diseases and contributes as a significant factor to motor vehicle accidents. The application offers first&#8209;hand experiences with alcohol in a safe environment. This is done by simulating a party situation using 125 different 360&#8209;degree movie sequences and displaying it in a virtual reality headset. The users create their own experience through a choose your own adventure game experience. The experience is designed to acquire skills for recognizing and handling peer pressure, which has been found to be one of the main reasons for drinking initiation. These skills are acquired though experimental learning. The application is a product of a co&#8209;design process involving  10 students (aged 18&#8209;28) studying film making and game design at Askov Folk High School (a special kind of Danish boarding school without exams for young adults), Denmark, their teachers, alcohol experts from social services and researchers with expertise within health promotion, social marketing, VR, interaction design and game development. Additionally, 35 students from Askov Boarding School (aged 15&#8209;17) participated as actors and extras. This article contributes to research within development of 360&#8209;degree video applications for experimental learning with a practical example. The iterative design process of the application, containing exploration of key concepts, concept design, prototype design, pre&#8209;usability testing, innovation design and usability test is described, as well as our reflections on virtual experimental learning in the application.

Abstract:
Games are a great source of entertainment and are used by people of all ages; they motivate and engage people and affect their behavior. Therefore, games have been widely studied in many non&#8209;game contexts. Education is one of those areas where gamified, and game&#8209;based learning strategies have been implemented and explored. To engage and motivate students to quiz each other, and as a side effect, build a question bank, as well as to study the gaming and learning behavior of students, we used a peer&#8209;quizzing game called "Tower of Questions" (ToQ). The game uses some themes and mechanics found in tower defense (TD) games. The students received points for posing and answering the questions in the game in the form of gems. Students played the game with pseudonyms for one academic term and were told not to disclose their identities to anyone. We conducted a 3&#8209;month long study for two consecutive years in the same first&#8209;year undergraduate computer science course.  In this paper, we present the findings from our studies using ToQ, specifically findings related to the students’ self&#8209;monitoring and quizzing activities based on the game logs and two self&#8209;reported surveys from data collected in the second year of the study.

Abstract:
Knowledge in Computer Science (CS) is essential, and companies have increased their demands for CS professionals. Despite this, many jobs remain vacant. Furthermore, computational thinking (CT) skills are required in all contexts of problem solving. A further serious problem arises from the gender disparity in technology related ﬁelds. Even if tech companies want to hire women in technology, the number of women who enter these fields is remarkably low. In high schools with no technical focus, most teenagers acquire only low&#8209;level skills in CS. The consequences are misleading preconceptions about the fundamental ideas of CS and stereotype&#8209;based expectations. Consequently, many teenagers exclude computing from their career path. In this paper, two promising concepts to overcome these challenges are presented. In 2018, a voluntary gamified lecture “Design your own app”, held at the University of Graz for students of all degree programs, was introduced. The course attracted over 200 students and received positive evaluations. This led to the second concept. In January 2019, a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) with the title “Get FIT in Computer Science” was designed and launched in August 2019 on the platform iMooX.at with the goal to provide a basic introduction to different concepts of CS, including programming and the application of game design strategies. The MOOC was accompanied by an offline lecture, following the principles of flipped classroom and inverse blended learning. For evaluation purposes, we collected data at three stages: 1) during the MOOC, 2) during the offline lecture, and 3) two months after the lecture. The results showed that the MOOC framework was a promising approach to support and motivate at least a certain group of first&#8209;semester students, especially those who had no prior knowledge in CS.

Abstract:
This paper presents empirical findings from a qualitative study on Minecraft as a mathematical tool and learning environment. Even though Minecraft has been used for several years in classrooms around the world, there is a lack of detailed empirical studies of how students learn subject&#8209;related content by working with the game. This study is based on a design experiment with an inquiry&#8209;based teaching unit for fifth graders, which focused on using the coordinate system embedded in Minecraft, as a means to navigate and explore the game in order to solve mathematical problems. Based on student interviews, we explore how the students experienced and switched to new perspectives on mathematical knowledge through their participation in the teaching unit. Using thematic analysis, we explore data from six group interviews. The theoretical framework is based on domain theory, dialogical theory and notions of students’ mathematical agency. The key analytical findings regard the students’ experience of the coordinate system as part of both the academic domain of mathematics and their everyday domain of playing Minecraft, how they actively use the coordinate system to improve play in Minecraft and how they experience new ways of participating in mathematics. The article concludes by offering design principles for the future use of computer games in mathematics education.

Abstract:
Blended learning is a hybrid of traditional face&#8209;to&#8209;face and different types of online learning services. Blended learning offers synchronous and asynchronous learning experiences that combine the conveniences of online courses while maintaining in&#8209;person contact. Blended learning addresses the needs of students who are unable to attend classes entirely, but who nonetheless demand opportunities for personal interaction. The appropriate instructional content design becomes one of the crucial components to support the success of blended learning activities. This study proposed the development and practical use of document&#8209;based rich and interactive content in EPUB3 to provide an exciting instructional content model. EPUB3 is a digital publishing standard with prosperous features and flexible implementation that is widely accepted in academic and industry. The EPUB3 digital book content was integrated into a Moodle learning management system to support synchronous and asynchronous blended learning environments. A questionnaire was applied to find out the learners' responses and involved 155 undergraduate students at The State University of Malang, Indonesia. The questionnaire results showed the developed content model was feasible and suitable to be implemented in a blended learning environment. Students seem interested and enthusiastic about being involved in various learning activities that add new experiences.

Abstract:
An e&#8209;Learning project has been rolled out in Gauteng schools in an attempt to improve the quality of educationand move towards paperless classrooms. The purpose of this study was to investigate the challenges faced by Tshwane SouthSecondary Schools associated with the implementation of the e&#8209;Learning project with a view to suggest possible solutions.The study followed a qualitative research approach with a case study research design. The study population consisted ofteachers, school management team (SMT), and learners. Purposive sampling was used to select three teachers, six learnersand three school management team members of the schools’ e&#8209;Learning committees. Data was collected through individualsemi&#8209;structure interviews and focus group interview. The Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluationmodel (ADDIE model) was used to provide a theoretical perspective on how instructional designers, training developers, andeducators should design and develop a program such as e&#8209;Learning. The data was analysed using a thematic approach. Thestudy found that teachers were not adequately trained prior to the implementation of e&#8209;Learning, which impacted negativelyon the project. Teachers had difficulty in operating the smartboards and accessing the learning resources that has beenloaded in the smartboards which affected the implementation of the project. The study concluded that poor planning on thesite of Department of Basic Education has resulted into challenges that hampered the implementation of e&#8209;Learning. Thestudy recommends extensive training of both learners and teachers in the use of e&#8209;Learning.

Abstract:
The mission of today’s universities is to prepare the students properly to live and work in the 21st century. International research demonstrates the positive impact of using iPads in teaching. Successful deploying of mobile learning (m&#8209;learning) is not a matter of accident, but depends on users’ acceptance of the technology. The purpose of this article is to create a mobile learning adoption pre&#8209;model tailored to the needs of a private university. To achieve this goal, valued adoption models were analyzed and, on their basis, the new model was created. The pre&#8209;model has been tested with a questionnaire. A paper&#8209;based survey was conducted among 640 students representing 25 countries. The questionnaire was grouped into sections: specifications of mobile devices owned by students and mobile internet access, expectation from mobile education application and attitudes towards current and future use of mobile devices in education. We computed all data with The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences – IBM SPSS Statistics version 25. The results of the research showed that the students from a central&#8209;eastern European University are technologically ready for mobile learning. Moreover, there appears to be no cause for concern regarding students from post&#8209;Soviet countries with respect to their competency to meet the demands of modern teaching in the form of mobile learning. Students have shown that they have clearly defined expectations for educational materials for mobile devices, which will be a challenge for the university when creating m&#8209;learning materials. Furthermore, students must feel the university's support in using mobile applications. That is why the teachers face a serious task: teachers must be prepared to show students the benefits of mobile learning, so they not only need to be trained but also convinced that it is worth using mobile learning.

Abstract:
Cognitive presence sustains the learning community through intellectual discourse. Previous studies have explored cognitive presence using mainly quantitative measures in relation to students’ perceived learning. This study adopts a mixed&#8209;method approach to investigate students’ perception of cognitive presence, its relationship with academic performance, and its manifestation in blended learning courses in selected Tanzanian universities. The study adds empirical evidence about the emerging blended learning courses. A total of 351 students were involved in the study. The findings show that students reported a high cognitive presence (mean = 3.9, SD = .51). Furthermore, cognitive presence predicted student performance. Qualitative data show that students explored information through interaction in group discussions and presentations, with the main push being questions from instructors (teaching presence). Students integrated and applied their knowledge by discussing among themselves, teaching others, and practicing what they had learned. Nevertheless, lack of prompts for feedback, time constraints and lack of confidence were linked with low levels of cognitive presence. The study concludes that students experience high cognitive presence, which predicts their academic performance. The findings imply that cognitive presence tends to influence student performance, regardless of the varying levels of its manifestation.

Abstract:
Academic writing in higher education involves acculturation of discourse characterised by new and unfamiliar social, cultural and academic conventions which remain a huge challenge for instructors and students worldwide. This study aimed at investigating the use of Blackboard Collaborated&#8209;Based Instruction to improve academic writing skills of second language writers. Drawing from Vygotsky’s sociocultural framework, this study is premised on online collaborative writing tasks which encourage peer feedback and the exchange of ideas that gives sense of an audience larger than one consisting only of the teacher. Data were collected through metacognitive reflective interview of eight first&#8209;year students registered for a Bachelor of Education degree programme. The findings show that Blackboard Collaborated&#8209;Based Instruction provided second language writers with an online learning community in which they collaborate and help each other in editing, revising, and improving their academic essay through peer feedback. The findings also provide an insight into how learning academic writing skills is facilitated by scaffolding between peers wherein Blackboard Collaborated&#8209;Based Instruction serves as a mediator in students’ development of academic writing.

Abstract:
Changing trends in educational technology are one of the driving forces behind many of the new educational strategies Higher Education Institutions are introducing. These changes are frequently justified with the “digital native” nature of the current generation of students who have been surrounded by digital technology from the moment they were born and are expected to also feel comfortable to use and adopt technological tools for their learning purposes. There have been many studies trying to assess the veracity of this assumption, but we still do not have enough data to confirm or deny this willingness and aptitude or even assess if students benefit from a technologically supported approach to learning. More studies are therefore necessary, in particular in subject areas that are not so connected to the technology, like humanities, economics, and social sciences, where students cannot be expected to be so proficient in the use of those tools and therefore their technology adoption process might be dependent of other variables. This article intends to contribute to this effort by presenting a study that uses the UTAUT model to assess which variables influence the use and adoption of educational technologies’ tools by Higher Education Marketing students. The result showed that, for these students, Social Influence (or Social Factors) was the most relevant variable to determine their Behavioural Intention.

Do Healthcare Metadata Models Designed for Web Publishing Meet the Accreditation Standards? A Case Study in the Healthcare and Medical Education

pp356&#8209;369
Authors:
Reem Alfayez
Abstract:
This article reports comparison results from studying the alignment of selected metadata models, used to manage E&#8209;Learning Materials (ELM) in the medicine and healthcare education, against the accreditation standards of the European Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (EACCME). The study aims to (1) illustrate the variety of application profiles developed as metadata models in that field, (2) identify the alignment of the metadata models with the criteria set by the EACCME. This study com¬pared several application profiles, developed based on established metadata standards, using an evaluation matrix created using the accreditation criteria set by the EACCME. Further technical criteria were added to compare between the metadata models and their alignment with the new techniques used for publishing data online. Such techniques aid in the searchabililty and discovery of online content via the internet. Therefore, the use of XML and RDF technologies combined with the use of ontologies and controlled vocabulary was emphasized in the implementation of many metadata models. One limitation faced during conducting this research was the poor documentation of the methodology for designing the metadata models. Despite this, it is apparent that the EACCME criteria can work as best practices guidelines for describing the content of digital libraries with medical and healthcare content in order to be accredited later on. The study showed that the medicine and healthcare educational content requires specialized metadata models that consider having specific properties such as clinical history and expiry time of its material shown in some of the application profiles. Further research should be conducted to evaluate the completeness and conformity of applying the application profiles in digital libraries and online repositories to the standards’ guidelines.

Spaces of Joint Inquiry Through Visual Facilitation and Representations in Higher Education: An Exploratory case study
Pages:
pp373&#8209;386
Authors:
Heidi Hautopp
Stine Ejsing-Duun
Abstract:
This study investigates how the use of visual facilitation and representations, e.g. visualisations and video productions, combined with peer&#8209;feedback sessions can create exploratory approaches to game design in online teaching. The article analyses an iterative game development process in an online learning context. The empirical data is primarily based on an explorative case study of “Games for change”; a course held in 2018 in which master students from the international Nordic Visual Studies and Art Education (NoVA) design games that address issues in society. Throughout the course, the students from universities in Finland, Sweden and Denmark engaged in a cross&#8209;cultural collaboration across campuses. The purpose of the study was to explore how to establish an online space for joint design inquiry in the context of ‘games for change’ across time and space as well as cultural and professional barriers. The data used for analysis includes teaching observations, videos of play sessions, photos and visual representations, students’ reflection papers and students’ written and oral evaluations after completion of the course. The analysis is based on different problem&#8209;based learning (PBL) activities; lectures, video instructions, presentation&#8209; and feedback sessions, reflexive exercises and students’ self&#8209;directed design and learning processes in groups. As part of the game course, teachers presented game theory and exercises through videos and visualisations to support the students’ iterative game design processes. The analysis of the PBL activities shows that teachers’ video instructions relating theoretical game concepts to the students’ actual group work supported the introduction to the game field as well as their design processes. The balance between the value of video instructions with specific feedback and teachers’ time for preparation is a relevant issue for further exploration in online teaching. Moreover, findings show that the students’ visualisations and video productions exemplifying game situations created a visible reference point for further discussions in feedback sessions across campuses, which guided game development. Thus, the combination of inquiry approaches, critical game theory and design processes combined with students’ visualisations and video productions provides  interesting connections for bridging gaps between cultures and professions, e.g. in art and games. By the rich and visual descriptions of PBL activities, student work and reflective evaluations, the exploratory case study can function as inspiration for applying similar approaches to new local contexts in higher education.

Building Creative Critical Online Learning Communities through Digital Moments
Pages:
pp387&#8209;396
Authors:
Wendy Barber
Abstract:
This paper is a mixed methods case study measuring student perceptions of a pedagogical strategy called “Digital Moments” (DM) for developing creative interactive online learning communities. The theoretical framework within which this resides is the Fully Online Learning Community (FOLC) model (vanOostveen et al, 2016), based on a foundation of problem&#8209;based learning, cognitive and social presence, and learner&#8209;centred pedagogies.The article reviews a specific teaching strategy for increasing social presence and student engagement through the use of creative and artistic expression in problem&#8209;based learning spaces. Using “Digital Moments” as a way to build inclusion in two synchronous graduate online courses, the author describes how the teaching strategy increased student participation, developed student ownership of learning, and encouraged collaborative processes between participants. This teaching strategy makes a significant contribution to digital pedagogy. Although the growth of online learning is quite substantial, our ability to develop online communities that inspire critical and creative thinking has not kept pace. Traditional teacher&#8209;centred learning environments do not meet the needs of students in today’s Fourth Industrial Revolution. As such, the FOLC model provides an online learning community model that removes traditional teacher&#8209;learner roles, allows the instructor to act as a facilitator and challenges learners to co&#8209;design and co&#8209;create the learning process. Within this digital space, collaborative disruption is encouraged, and, in fact necessary for the types of critical and creative thinking to emerge that are central to the FOLC model. Digital Moments, is one example of a pedagogical strategy that enables learners to co&#8209;create and own the digital learning space, within a fully online learning community.

Learning Analytics in Flipped Classrooms: A Scoping Review
Pages:
pp397&#8209;409
Authors:

Evangelia Triantafyllou
Abstract:
The Flipped Classroom (FC) is an instruction method, where the traditional lecture and homework sessions are inverted. Online material is given to students in order to gain necessary knowledge before class, while class time is devoted to application of this knowledge and reflection. The hypothesis is that there could be deep and creative discussions when teacher and students physically meet, which has known a significant surge of popularity in the past decade. A marked recent trend in the FC is the increased use of Learning Analytics (LA) to support the development of the FC and students’ reflexive learning. The aim of this paper is to investigate the literature on applications of LA in FCs, and to determine the best practices and needs for technological development supporting LA in the FC by means of a scoping review. This literature review revealed that there is potential in using LA in the FC, especially as a means to predict students’ learning outcome and to support adaptive learning and improvement on the curriculum. However, further long&#8209;term studies and development is necessary to encourage self&#8209;directed learning in students and to develop the whole of the FC for a more diverse population of students. We anticipate an increased and expanded use of LA to come, with focus on predictive and prescriptive analytics providing more adaptive learning experience. We also anticipate that LA will expand beyond data mining to correlate student performance and online engagement with the aim to include a wider range of possibilities of interventions and adaptation of the learning experience.

Abstract:
To have sustainable societies, we need to accelerate the energy transition towards clean energy solutions, however, awareness and understanding of the process as well as intentions to change behaviors are still limited, especially among young people. An optimal balance considering the point of view from all parties involved is out of sight without a focus on social structures and a dialogue among all parties. In this context, universities have a critical role to play: these institutions build capacity through the development of new knowledge, new understanding and new insights, and can therefore provide effective solutions to complex societal challenges. In search of innovative approaches to reach young people, whose communicative paradigm has become more interactive and participatory, the use of serious gaming in formal education is gaining attention among scholars and practitioners: they can foster skills and abilities, contribute to content development of complex issues by integrating insights from different disciplines, and permit learning experiences that are not possible in real life. In this paper, we introduce “We&#8209;Energy Game”, a serious game that address the urgency and complexities in the provision of affordable energy from renewable sources for an entire town. During the game, players negotiate, from their respective roles, which energy source they want to employ and on which location, with the goal to make a village or city energy neutral. Then, we present findings from a pretest and posttest completed by a hundred university students in The Netherlands to analyze the effects of the game on players awareness, understanding and efficacy beliefs. Results reveal positive outcomes on all variables.

Abstract:
This study investigated the possible factors that predict e&#8209;learning integration into the teaching and learning of science subjects among preservice science teachers. A unified e&#8209;learning integration model was developed in which factors such as attitude, intention, skill and flow experience served as precursors of e&#8209;learning integration. This was done to help close the gap that no previous studies have developed a structural model to statistically explain the interactions among the most influential factors in various technology integration models. The survey method was used to gather data from 100 preservice science teachers and partial least square structural equation modelling technique was applied for structural path analysis and testing of the developed model. Results revealed a good model fit and hypotheses formulated in this study were faithfully supported. The results also revealed that all factors investigated were found to be significant predictors of e&#8209;learning integration with skill standing out as the most significant and strongest factor that predicts the integration of e&#8209;learning by preservice science teachers.

Abstract:
Digitally mediated role plays indicate potential for collaboration, social exchange of information and knowledge as well as motivation for learning beyond classroom time. These elements are critical for ESL learners’ development of language and argumentative writing practices. The aim of this research project was to investigate how students’ engagement with and participation in online role play collaborative arguments shaped their literacy practices, and influenced their beliefs and thinking regarding particular societal issue. This qualitative research project based on a larger ethnographic case study and tools of action research investigated students’ interactions and experiences before, during and after the online role play. The study involved 20 ESL pre&#8209;service students at one university in Uganda and was conducted in both the real and online spaces. The real space involved face&#8209;to&#8209;face sessions aimed at building students’ confidence in using blogs for online role play. While the online space involved non&#8209;participant observations to gain understanding of the social dynamics of students’ engagement in online role play, and the opportunities for students to engage in literacy practices related to online argumentative compositions. The study findings indicated that engagement in online role play using blog platform provided a rich environment for learners to exercise their creativity, orchestrate multiple ways of meaning&#8209;making and build tactical relations for purposes of collective action. Furthermore, the use of online role play collaborative arguments facilitated a shift from “ascribed” to “achieved” identities where students did not only become aware that they were dealing with issues larger than individual perspectives, associated with school, family, culture and the legal system, but also that there need for them to take part in the civic action.

Abstract:
Video is a rich medium that conveys more social cues than text. Use of video in an online discussion forum therefore has the potential to increase social presence in online learning environments. This experimental study compared a group using video for a portion of the required discussion posts to a group using only text in an online undergraduate course. While there was a correlation between perceived social presence and satisfaction with the course, there were no significant differences in perceived social presence or course satisfaction between the two groups. Open&#8209;ended comments revealed a mix of positive and negative reactions to the use of video. This study highlights the need for continuing research on the use of video in online discussion forums to assess the benefits of video relative to its possible negative effect on “anytime, anywhere” flexibility

: Education authorities in Norway endorse online courses for in&#8209;service teachers to raise education standards and to promote digital competence. Naturally, these offerings present teachers with opportunities to integrate new theoretical perspectives and their professional experience in an online learning community. The inquiry into one's professional practice, enhanced by critical reflection in a group of fellow professionals, is considered essential for a lifelong learning practitioner, however, the emerging examples of instructional design tend to prioritise content delivery rather than professional discourse. In this paper, we demonstrate how the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework could be adopted to transform learning design, which prioritises the delivery of individual assignments, into a more collaborative learning experience. Using the CoI instructional design principles and the associated questionnaire, we have investigated student perceptions of learning via an online course and formulated recommendations about how the course design can be refined to promote learning in the community. Despite the modest evidence, this investigation can serve as an example of how a concrete learning design can be improved based on this validated e&#8209;learning model.

Abstract:
Academic dishonesty in higher education is a perverse problem affecting institutions of learning in many countries across the globe.  More alarmingly, numerous studies have pointed to increasing rates of cheating and plagiarism over the past few decades offering a wide array of explanations and theories for this trend.  A relatively new feature of both higher education and the discussion of academic dishonesty involves the growing market for online education.  Within the last decade, online education has become a permanent fixture increasing its reach in education markets throughout the world.  The trend of online education is seen as bringing with it a new set of opportunities and challenges related to academic dishonesty.  With high rates of cheating already a well&#8209;documented problem in the traditional (face&#8209;to&#8209;face) learning environment, it is important to analyze how online education factors into this scenario.  The goal of this paper is to provide the reader with a critical analysis of the current literature on academic dishonesty in online education and to propose areas for future research where gaps in the literature exist.

Abstract:
This paper reports on a study that integrated two instant messaging applications (Moya Messenger App and WhatsApp) and a myUnisa’s online discussion forum (ODF), and utilised them as tools to support student learning at an open and distance e&#8209;learning university in South Africa. The participants in this study were 41 undergraduate education students enrolled for an undergraduate English Studies module. Employing a case study research design, the study utilised voluntary sampling to select its participants, and set out to answer three research questions. Data were collected through the three afore&#8209;mentioned tools. To this effect, the study made the following observations. First, both the instructor and students were able to engage in asynchronous and synchronous scaffolding using Moya Messenger App. This included engaging in features of scaffolding such as orientation, coaching, conceptual scaffolding and meta&#8209;cognitive scaffolding, largely by the instructor. Second, the instructor used Moya Messener App to engage in presence teaching, while students utilised it to engage in presence learning. Third, students utilised WhatsApp to produce short synchronous formal essays based on a compare and contrast essay writing activity. Fourth and last, students used myUnisa’s ODF to produce meta&#8209;content reflective writing about the module.

Abstract:
: Flipped learning has become a popular approach for supporting higher education, but less is known about  its link with the learners’ emotions, which are known to play an important role in  science education. The main purpose of this study is to analyse the effects of the flipped learning approach on students’ learning emotions. This research utilised a quasi&#8209;experimental design with  two data collection time points (pre&#8209; and post&#8209;study).  The sample involved 65 students from the science track in one Saudi university. The participants were distributed into two groups, taught by the traditional and the flipped learning methods respectively. Data collection took place over a period of 4 study weeks. The results show that the flipped mode group had obtained higher learning emotions mean score compared to its traditional counterpart, and they showed improvement in learning emotions mean score over the period of the study. The findings indicate that further study is needed both to validate the current study in a different context , and also to determine how the flipped learning environment can better support students’ interactions and their emotions.

Students’ Creativity in Virtual vs. Classroom Courses on the Basis of Their Personality Traits: A Prediction Study
Pages:
pp525&#8209;536
Authors:
Yasamin Abedini
Abstract:
The present study aims to compare the creativity of students in virtual and classroom courses at University of Isfahan and study its prediction based on the personality traits of these students. The statistical population of the study consisted of all faculty members and students at University of Isfahan in academic year 2017&#8209;2018. Among them, 150 subjects were selected using Morgan Table and random sampling method. The data collection was done through Abedi’s Creativity Questionnaire (1993) and Costa and McCrae Personality Questionnaire (1992). Data were analyzed by T&#8209;test for independent groups, Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis. Results show that there is a significant difference in creativity scores of students attending virtual courses and those attending classroom courses, as well as between female and male students. However, the relationship between personality traits and creativity was significantly stronger among classroom students than the virtual students, and these traits were better predictors of creativity in classroom students than in virtual students. Based on findings, it can be concluded that more usage of the information and communication technologies such as internet, wireless networks, cell phone, etc.(ICTs) by virtual students not only increases their creativity, but also, as an important environmental and intrapersonal factor, affects the relationship between personality traits and creativity among these students and weakens it. This finding shows the great role of acquisitive&#8209;digital factors in students’ creativity.

Title:
EFL Learners’ Perspectives on the use of Smartphones in Higher Education Settings in Slovakia

Abstract:
MALL (Mobile assisted language learning) affords new opportunities for EFL (English as a foreign language) learners and teachers. Research on MALL is still in its infancy in Slovakia, and this paper attempts to fill in this gap by examining students’ perception and attitudes towards the use of smartphones for the purposes of learning and practicing English. The target population of this study constituted of the Slovak university EFL learners whose major was Teacher Training of English Language and Literature (n = 77) at a Slovak university. The research method employed to achieve the objectives of this study was a 5&#8209;point Likert scale questionnaire, comprising of two sets of statements: general and out&#8209;of&#8209;the&#8209;classroom statements with a total of 29 items. The research results for both sets of statements imply that the participants display moderately positive attitudes towards smartphones in the context of EFL learning. However, the findings also reveal some issues surrounding the perception and potential use of smartphones such as the inability to plan students’ language learning appropriately and effectively, general underuse of smartphone apps, or problems related to practicing speaking skills. The results further suggest the immediate need to develop and enhance the awareness of smartphones and their potential in the process of teaching and learning English so that the EFL learners can utilize considerable opportunities these smart devices offer. Finally, the limitations of this study are recognized, and it is emphasized that conducting further research in this area is urgently needed.

Abstract:
In a flipped classroom, students engage in active learning during class time and have individual information&#8209;transmission outside class time. University students need to complete the pre/post&#8209;class activities to fully benefit from flipped classroom. It is important that teachers adopt practical methods including teacher&#8209;student out&#8209;of&#8209;classroom communication (OCC) to help students manage their time effectively and stay on task. This research examines the practice of OOC in a flipped first&#8209;year postgraduate Business Law course at an Australian university that comprises a large overseas student cohort. By means of a questionnaire, the researcher collected data about student perceptions of OCC, their motives for engaging in OCC, and the change of the motives in a flipped classroom. Student demographics, online participation, and academic performance data were exported from the university database. The student answers, participation, and performance were measured and compared with t&#8209;tests. The preliminary results show that in a flipped classroom, students were more motivated to engage in OCC. Moreover, the short&#8209;term online participation improved for the students who were communicated by the teacher outside classroom. However, an analysis of the data indicated no statistically significant difference in students’ academic performance. In the concluding sections of this paper, the limitations of this study are acknowledged, followed by several recommendations for future research.

Title:
The Level of ICT Infrastructure as a Factor of ICT Integration in Greek High School Science Teaching

pp562&#8209;574
Authors:
Charalampos Apostolou
Abstract:
This paper examines the extent to which the level of technological equipment affects the integration of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in Greek high school science teaching. The limited ICT infrastructure environment, with only one computer&#8209;projector system available and access to the internet (“PC&#8209;VP” environment), is compared to the high level ICT environment (“1:1” environment) where, in addition to the computer&#8209;projector system, each student has access to a computer and the internet. It is a study relying on a relatively small dataset derived from student answers to a questionnaire aiming to determine the degree to which some of the “expected” ICT benefits reach the students.  The level of ICT integration is judged by the degree to which the ICT benefits reach the students.  That is, the more the ICT benefits reach the students, the better – or the greater &#8209; the ICT integration is.  The participants were eighty&#8209;nine, 14&#8209;year&#8209;old students who belonged in four different classes and the teacher who taught Physics in those classes. The SPSS non&#8209;parametric "Man&#8209;Whitney U Test" test was used to compare the statistical distributions of student answers. The results show that, when the applied teaching approach is used, the ICT integration is equally successful in both environments. This questions the idea of investing in “1:1" environments in the Greek public schools where less student centered and inquiry oriented teaching approaches are the norm.  It also highlights the importance of the specific teaching approach as an ICT integration tool in “PC&#8209;VP” environments that still exist in most Greek schools.
