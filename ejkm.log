Authors:
Patricia Carrillo
Abstract:
A number of organisations have recognised the importance of managing their organisation knowledge in a more structured manner. However, the question arises as to how to evaluate the benefits of a Knowledge Management (KM) strategy and its associated initiatives on the performance of the organisation. This paper presents a framework for the assessment of the likely impact of KM and discusses findings from an evaluation workshop held to critique the framework.

KM as a Chemin Faisant: The Valtech Experience
Pages:
pp13&#8209;22
Authors:
Daniele Chauvel
Charles Despres
Abstract:
Valtech is a Paris&#8209;based consulting firm established in 1993 and devoted to e&#8209;business technologies. The company was initially structured as a distributor of new information technologies to the French and European market, which secondarily provided training in the use of its products. Valtech now positions itself as a pure knowledge&#8209;transfer firm that instructs clients in the strategic use and development of cutting&#8209;edge electronic technologies. Valtech organized itself according to KM principles in 1993, but only became aware of KM as a formal organizing framework in 1998. While the adoption of KM is often "pushed" onto companies by the academic or consulting communities, Valtech pulled itself toward KM organizing logics by the New Age of business it defined for itself. It is in this way an excellent example of strategic commitment and organizational design from a KM perspective. It is also relatively unique in that most of the literature records KM adoption from a "push" rather than a "pull" perspective.

Reconsidering the tacit&#8209;explicit distinction — A move toward functional (tacit) knowledge management
Pages:
pp23&#8209;32
Authors:
Cynthia Jimes
James Lucardie
Abstract:
To move beyond the technology focus and adequately embrace knowledge, organisations need a working conceptualisation of knowledge. Within the literature, the dominant conceptualisation converges around the acknowledgement of tacit and explicit types distinctly. This paper argues that a more fundamental approach is necessary. The functional view is a theory on the nature of knowledge that serves as a promising alternative. By placing knowledge within the context of goals and formalisation possibilities, it can help transform organisations from information&#8209;intensive to truly knowledge&#8209;based.

Authors:
Jason Kirk
Ana Vasconcelos
Abstract:
This paper looks into the consultancy processes and professional practices of management consultants and of technology consultants from a knowledge management perspective.   The process of consultancy in both cases was characterised by the following categories drawn from the analysis of interviews: boundaries, actors, process and information. The findings for each type of consultancy were synthesized into two different narratives. Considerable differences in the way they operate were identified in terms of: the definition of the context of the problem and risk assessment; negotiation through the client system and the use of language and vocabulary in the consultancy process, leading to the development of different professional discourses and different approaches to the facilitation of organisational learning

Right Questions to Capture Knowledge

Authors:
Theresia Olsson Neve
Abstract:
Existing tools that are used to support the process of transferring tacit knowledge into explicit . knowledge do not support the affection of individuals and their knowledge, but rather data and information processing. A more personalised view of knowledge is required, and a toolbox has been constructed in order to increase the individual's capacity to describe hisher own situation within organisations. This is assumed to motivate the person to contribute with knowledge. An empirical investigation of a prototypical nature has been conducted. The empirical results are positive for eliciting knowledge.

Developing an Instrument for Knowledge Management Project Evaluation
Pages:

Authors:
Zuhair Iftikhar
Abstract:
Many knowledge management (KM) projects have been initiated, some of which have been successes but many have been failures. Measuring the success or failure of KM initiatives is not easy, and in order to do so some kind of measurement process has to be available. There are three points at which evaluation of KM projects can, and should be, done: (1) when deciding whether to start and where to focus, (2) once under way, following up on a project and making adjustments if needed, and (3) when completed, to evaluate the project outcomes.  This paper concentrates on the first two areas by developing a general instrument for evaluation of KM projects.

Kaushik V. Pandya
Abstract:
In order for companies to remain competitive they must be able to utilise their knowledge of customers, products, services and resources. This can be instilled in the culture of the organisation, and this becomes paramount when the organisation deals in international markets. This research paper focuses on five main attributes, most pertinent to this study, of culture (identified by Terpstra and Sarathy, and by Gesteland). These attributes are technology and material culture, religion, language, education, and business ethics. The primary data comprised of interviews from six different e&#8209;Businesses.

Abstract:
Case studies of knowledge management practices are often conducted in organizations where the aim is to manage knowledge for future operational improvements. What about knowledge management for organizations with limited life&#8209;spans that are preparing for closure? Such organizations are not common but can benefit from knowledge management strategy. This case study concerns the knowledge management strategy of an organization that is preparing for its final phase of operations. We facilitated two group workshops with senior managers to scope a strategy, following which the organization initiated a set of projects to implement the resulting actions. This paper reviews their implemented actions against those designed in the workshop to shed light on knowledge management in this uncommon situation.

Authors:
Mark Sharratt

Abstract:
Information Technology is no longer regarded solely as a repository within knowledge management but also as a collaborative tool. This change of role gives rise to online communities (OLCs), which extend the loci of existing communities of practice. To leverage the potential of these communities, organisations must understand the mechanisms underpinning members' decisions to share knowledge and expertise within the community. This paper discusses existing research and develops a theoretical model of factors that affect knowledge sharing in OLCs. The aim is to increase our understanding of the antecedents to knowledge&#8209;sharing in OLCs.

Visual Tools within MaKE — A Knowledge Management Method

Authors:

Hanifa Shah
Abstract:
This paper focuses on the practical significance of visual tools in Knowledge Management (KM) and Information Systems (IS) development in the context of the development of MaKE, a KM method.  Visual tools are used extensively in KM and IS. However, this paper identifies a dilemma in the use of visual tools and examines how this dilemma was addressed during the development of some visual tools in MaKE. A brief description of MaKE is provided before visual tools are presented and discussed. The visual tools are called the Knowledge Targets Pyramid, Knowledge Tree, Knowledge Block, and the Linking Overview which are used to help present outcomes. They were reviewed and analysed in workshops in a major UK Fast Moving Consumer Goods manufacturer.   The authors suggest that the findings of this research are relevant to visual tools used as part of KM methods and frameworks and that if certain guidelines are borne in mind, visual tools are very helpful for understanding and communicating, in a short time frame, relatively complex phenomena. Within the context of MaKE the Knowledge Targets Pyramid, Knowledge Block, and the Linking Overview do this more effectively than the Knowledge Tree.

Lise Desmarais
Abstract:
This article proposes a Knowledge Networking approach to the development of Workplace Health & Safety Knowledge in order to overcome the limits and obstacles associated with the more traditional linear model of Knowledge Transfer in organisations. The province of Québec has developed a Network approach to managing workplace health and safety that is highly regarded by health & safety practitioners and researchers throughout Canada. Its research arm, the Robert Sauvé Research Institute on Workplace Health & Safety (IRSST) also uses a Knowledge Network approach to guide its research agenda. The success of those network initiatives has led the Eastern Canada Research Consortium on Workplace Health & Safety to create a Knowledge Transfer Research Laboratory (KTLab) to support research on the transfer of WHS best practices develop in Québec and elsewhere to Atlantic Canada using a networking approach.

Facilitating Organisational Sustainability Through Expert Investment Systems

Authors:
Carol Royal
Farhad Daneshgar
Loretta O'Donnell
Abstract:
This paper uses literature from the fields of organisational sustainability and human capital, which have demonstrated a link between sustainable human capital and the financial performance of the firm, to argue that securities analysts need to be able to systematically analyse human capital in order to provide transparent and well&#8209;informed investment recommendations. It is the function of securities analysts to attempt to predict the future financial performance of firms within an industry sector. Models for this analysis have traditionally been heavily quantitative, relying on mathematical models of future earnings forecasts, based on published annual financial statements from listed companies. Securities analysts' quantitative modeling methods are directly underpinned by qualifications and certification processes that encourage demonstrated skills in quantitative methods. The authors provide an opportunity for securities analysts to systematically gain insights on the human capital of firms using a future expert system, called Human Capital Analyser (HCA), whose general characteristics are also outlined in the conclusion of this article. This expert system will help bridge the knowledge gap in the work of securities analysts.

The effect of Managerial Power and Relational Trust on the Skills and Traits of Knowledge Acquisition: Evidence from the United Arab Emirates

Authors:
John D. Politis
Abstract:
Many organisations have recognised that knowledge is the most important resource in today's economy. Although knowledge management is seen as central to process and product innovation and improvement, to executive decision making and to organisational adaptation and renewal, little is known on the effect of managerial power and relational trust on the traits and skills of knowledge acquisition. A survey of 140 first line managers was conducted to investigate the relationship between managerial power, relational trust and knowledge acquisition attributes. Results indicate that most, but not all, of the managerial power dimensions enable employees' knowledge acquisition. Moreover, the findings show that relational (interpersonal) trust had a negative effect on the skills and traits of knowledge acquisition. It was also found that the dimensions of managerial power provided statistically significant additional predictive power, after having statistically controlled for the predictive effects of interpersonal trust.

Abstract:
One area of omission in knowledge intensive studies is within higher educationresearch where there is the virtuous circle of teaching, research and consulting professional work. Using a model adapted from Handzic (2001) and a survey modified from Arthur Andersen (1998) the perceived importance and perceived implementation to faculty members is explored. The discrepancy between results of the two forced the researchers to confront their own biases. Guidance was sought from ethnographic accounts which allowed allows the researcher to state personal feelings in a confessional accompaniment to the formal findings.

A New Insight into the Valuation of Start&#8209;ups: Bridging the Intellectual Capital Gap in Venture Capital Appraisals
Pages:
pp75&#8209;88
Authors:
Blanca María Martins Rodríguez
Abstract:
The emergence of a New Economy has brought consensus to the idea that innovation skills and capabilities are the main drivers of a firm's wealth generation capacity. The principal role that venture capital played in boosting American economic productivity and growth during the 1990s, fuelling innovation and the creation of new firms is well known. However, the huge number of bankruptcies among high&#8209;tech companies in 2000 generated general distrust in financial markets worldwide. In particular, it caused great reluctance to invest in start&#8209;up companies and led investors and academics to question and take an in&#8209;depth look at existing valuation procedures.   Building upon the concept of competitiveness of Man et al. (2002) and the premise that a firm's success is the result of appropriate strategy formulation and implementation (Grant, 2002), the present paper develops the start&#8209;up general valuation model (SGVM) as a first step to improving the investment appraisal of start&#8209;up companies and promoting a more effective allocation of resources in the economy.

Abstract:
Business Process Redesign (BPR) helps rethinking a process in order to enhance its performance. Practitioners have been developing methodologies to support BPR implementation. However, most methodologies lack actual guidance on deriving a process design threatening the success of BPR. In this paper, we suggest the use of a case&#8209;based reasoning technique (CBR) to support solving new problems by adapting previously successful solutions to similar problems to support redesigning new business processes by adapting previously successful redesign to similar business process. An implementation framework for BPR and the CBR's cyclical process are used as a knowledge management technical support to serve for the effective reuses of redesign methods as a knowledge creation and sharing mechanism.

Determinants of Successful Knowledge Management Programs

Authors:

Abstract:
The main objective of this paper is to investigate and identify the main determinants of successful knowledge management (KM) programs. We draw upon the institutional theory and the theory of technology assimilation to develop an integrative model of KM success that clarifies the role of information technology (IT) in relation to other important KM infrastructural capabilities and to KM process capabilities. We argue that the role of IT cannot be studied in isolation and that the effect of IT on KM success is fully mediated by KM process capabilities. The research model is tested with a survey study involving 191 KM practitioners. The empirical results provided strong support for the model. In addition to its theoretical contributions, this study also presents important practical implications through the identification of specific infrastructural capabilities leading to KM success.

Towards Process Modelling in 'Knowledge Management' Work

Authors:
John Kawalek
Diane Hart
Abstract:
This paper draws from the experience of undertaking what has been termed 'knowledge management' work, and outlines the approach being taken, which has focused on the conceptual design of human processes. This paper presents a way of thinking about knowledge management as a set of processes involving (for example) (i) the human process to which human knowledge is applied (e.g. an 'operation' of some sort), (ii) the human process in which knowledge is encouraged to be developed (e.g. a course of study, application of techniques, thinking, reflection etc), (iii) a process of reviewing a the experience in problematic situation in order that learning can be derived (e.g. an 'after action review'), (iv) the integration of all the above processes which is in some way 'managed' and 'co&#8209;ordinated' through the process of undertaking work as a 'knowledge manager'. The approach being taken assumes that it is the processes that are being managed, rather than the knowledge per se. The paper outlines the approach taken which draws upon the experiences, difficulties and anxieties of taking responsibility for a knowledge management initiative associated with the EU funded MEDFORIST project.

Authors:
Dawn Jutla
Abstract:
Building knowledge management (KM) infrastructure involves reuse and refocus of several existing infrastructure components, and awareness around future visions and conditions of infrastructure. We present a community perspective using a staircase metaphor for conceptualizing government supported KM infrastructure and services. Additionally we illustrate a model for government's role in providing and leveraging infrastructure components from all tiers of government. With examples, we build a case for adding diffusion of innovation characteristics, and features from innovation networks analysis in KM infrastructure. Observability and trialability are important to knowledge acquisition, while compatibility are central to knowledge application, packaging, and creation. Ease of use, and perceived usefulness affects knowledge use in all its forms.

Abstract:
This paper describes three building blocks of a technological Knowledge Management (KM) system that provides all relevant and practical means of supporting KM and thus differentiates itself from existing KM tools in goal and approach, as they usually deal with a limited range only. The three blocks described within this paper are: a virtual information pool, which utilizes Enterprise Application Integration (EAI), a single and central user interface providing ubiquitous access, and mechanisms to enrich the available data, essentially based on Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining techniques.

Abstract:
The Internet is enabling a new economy based on the networking of human knowledge. While the benefits of using I.T. to connect people to people and people to information within a business are commonly understood, much less is known about the advantages of well&#8209;managed partnerships across corporate boundaries. Building on the findings of a recent study of knowledge creating collaborations (Gadman and Cooper 2003), and the growing interest in Open Source Software development communities, (Von Hipple and Von Krogh 2003), (Cole and Lee 2003), this paper addresses the importance of selecting the most appropriate collaborative strategy to meet business needs and the challenges of managing relationships which often span organizational cultures and boundaries. The findings are relevant to any company that depends on the free flow of ideas among smart people and provides a lens through which we can learn and discover new and creative possibilities for the future.

Abstract:
This paper addresses knowledge management assumptions and development visions in the following types of organisations: organic product&#8209;focused and organic service&#8209;focused organisations, mechanistic bureaucratic and mechanistic product&#8209;focused organisations that represent different models of value creation. These types of organisations are identified and examined in relation to the changing knowledge management context of the transition economy in Estonia. Knowledge management priorities assessed by representatives of 95 organisations are then discussed in the qualitative research and learning framework.

Developing Systems to Support Organisational Learning in Product Development Organisations
Pages:
pp167&#8209;180
Authors:
Brian Donnellan
Abstract:
There are aspects of New Product Development (NPD) business processes that pose particularly difficult challenges to Organizational Learning systems. Short product and process life cycles compress the available time window for recouping the expenses associated with product development. Cross&#8209;functional collaboration in product development organizations requires the merging of knowledge from diverse disciplinary and personal skills&#8209;based perspectives. Cross&#8209;institutional collaboration leads a requirement for knowledge to be combined from participants across multiple collaborating organizations. Transient existence in teams and high turnover results in a reduction in organizational knowledge unless there is a repository for knowledge rather than a dependence on knowledge which is situated in the minds of individuals.  High rates of change in turbulent industries, such as electronics, motivates participants in NPD processes to effectively overcome these Organizational Learning challenges. The potential payoff includes time saved by not repeating mistakes and reuse of knowledge that leads to successful products and processes. IS research has paid little attention to NPD processes despite the fact that some IS appears to have the potential to have an impact in that area.   Recent research completed by these researchers in Analog Devices Inc identified Organizational Learning challenges encountered by engineering teams in product development. This paper will report on these challenges and will describe how systems were developed to support organizational learning to support the product development process.

Abstract:
The new economy not only poses challenges, but also offers opportunities for both private and public sectors alike. To meet the challenges and take the opportunities, government must take active initiatives to adopt new management tools, techniques and philosophies of the private sector and adapt to its circumstance. Knowledge management (KM) is such an area that needs to be further explored and exploited for its full benefits to be reaped.

Title:
The Impact of Question Structure when Sharing Knowledge
Pages:
pp189&#8209;196
Authors:
Heather Bircham
Abstract:
This paper investigates how the structure of a question may hinder or assist in the knowledge sharing process. It presents a theoretical framework that posits the notion that the structure of the question asked of the source may have an effect on the recipient's attitude toward the knowledge received. Question structure is examined from the perspective of knowledge articulation and attitude toward the knowledge received is considered from the position of relevance and value of the knowledge to the recipient's decision&#8209;making processes.

Abstract:
The transfer of knowledge between groups of individuals of different levels of expertise and orientation is discussed with reference to the manner in which knowledge is disseminated using the specialist language of a given domain. A prototype system that allows access to knowledge at these different levels, through the automatic construction of keyword indexes, is outlined. The controversial relationship between knowledge and language is the basis of arguments in this paper.

Title:
In Search of an Intellectual Capital General Theory
Pages:
pp213&#8209;226
Authors:
José María Viedma Martí
Abstract:
The development of intellectual capital theory has been guided by the ideas and thoughts of a handful of influential practitioners, including Karl Erik Sveiby (1997), RS Kaplan (Kaplan and Norton, 1992) and Leif Edvinson (Edvinson and Malone, 1997). These pioneers established the basis of the "intellectual capital standard theory". In the present paper the assumptions and principles that support the standard theory (the prevailing paradigm) are discussed. The paper then introduces other models and methodologies as alternatives to the standard theorysuch as the "IC Accounting System" (Mouritsen et al., 2001), the "Value Explorer" (Andriessen and Tissen, 2000) and the "Intellectual Capital Benchmarking System (ICBS)" (Viedma, 2001)and examines the foundations and principles on which the alternative new theory (the 'new paradigm') is based. Finally, the paper attempts to synthesise both of these theoretical approaches with other new views and contributions, and tries to develop the basis for a first general theory of intellectual capital.

IMPaKT: A Framework for Linking Knowledge Management to Business Performance
Pages:

Authors:

Abstract:
A number of organisations have recognised the importance of managing their organisation knowledge in a more structured manner. However, the question arises as to how to evaluate the benefits of a Knowledge Management (KM) strategy and its associated initiatives on the performance of the organisation. This paper presents a framework for the assessment of the likely impact of KM and discusses findings from an evaluation workshop held to critique the framework.

KM as a Chemin Faisant: The Valtech Experience
Pages:
pp13&#8209;22
Authors:
Daniele Chauvel
Charles Despres
Abstract:
Valtech is a Paris&#8209;based consulting firm established in 1993 and devoted to e&#8209;business technologies. The company was initially structured as a distributor of new information technologies to the French and European market, which secondarily provided training in the use of its products. Valtech now positions itself as a pure knowledge&#8209;transfer firm that instructs clients in the strategic use and development of cutting&#8209;edge electronic technologies. Valtech organized itself according to KM principles in 1993, but only became aware of KM as a formal organizing framework in 1998. While the adoption of KM is often "pushed" onto companies by the academic or consulting communities, Valtech pulled itself toward KM organizing logics by the New Age of business it defined for itself. It is in this way an excellent example of strategic commitment and organizational design from a KM perspective. It is also relatively unique in that most of the literature records KM adoption from a "push" rather than a "pull" perspective.

Reconsidering the tacit&amp#8209;explicit distinction — A move toward functional (tacit) knowledge management
Pages:
pp23&#8209;32
Authors:
Cynthia Jimes
James Lucardie
Abstract:
To move beyond the technology focus and adequately embrace knowledge, organisations need a working conceptualisation of knowledge. Within the literature, the dominant conceptualisation converges around the acknowledgement of tacit and explicit types distinctly. This paper argues that a more fundamental approach is necessary. The functional view is a theory on the nature of knowledge that serves as a promising alternative. By placing knowledge within the context of goals and formalisation possibilities, it can help transform organisations from information&#8209;intensive to truly knowledge&#8209;based.

Authors:
Jason Kirk
Ana Vasconcelos
Abstract:
This paper looks into the consultancy processes and professional practices of management consultants and of technology consultants from a knowledge management perspective.   The process of consultancy in both cases was characterised by the following categories drawn from the analysis of interviews: boundaries, actors, process and information. The findings for each type of consultancy were synthesized into two different narratives. Considerable differences in the way they operate were identified in terms of: the definition of the context of the problem and risk assessment; negotiation through the client system and the use of language and vocabulary in the consultancy process, leading to the development of different professional discourses and different approaches to the facilitation of organisational learning

Authors:

Abstract:
Existing tools that are used to support the process of transferring tacit knowledge into explicit . knowledge do not support the affection of individuals and their knowledge, but rather data and information processing. A more personalised view of knowledge is required, and a toolbox has been constructed in order to increase the individual's capacity to describe hisher own situation within organisations. This is assumed to motivate the person to contribute with knowledge. An empirical investigation of a prototypical nature has been conducted. The empirical results are positive for eliciting knowledge.

Developing an Instrument for Knowledge Management Project Evaluation

Authors:
Zuhair Iftikhar
Abstract:
Many knowledge management (KM) projects have been initiated, some of which have been successes but many have been failures. Measuring the success or failure of KM initiatives is not easy, and in order to do so some kind of measurement process has to be available. There are three points at which evaluation of KM projects can, and should be, done: (1) when deciding whether to start and where to focus, (2) once under way, following up on a project and making adjustments if needed, and (3) when completed, to evaluate the project outcomes.  This paper concentrates on the first two areas by developing a general instrument for evaluation of KM projects.

Abstract:
Due to an evolution of business models compatible with networked economy, office — environments of this age need effective support for collaboration among office workers. This article demonstrates that existing Extended Office Systems (EOS) are not specifically designed to maintain awareness and knowledge&#8209;sharing requirements of the collaborating actors of many of today's networked office environments. Using an awareness framework for sharing of contextual knowledge in collaborative business processes, this article provides general design directives for a Collaboration&#8209; Aware EOS (CAEOS) system that facilitates sharing of the contextual knowledge among office workers in networked offices. In order to assess its effectiveness, this framework is applied to a network management case study with the aim of identifying the awareness requirements of the actors within that process. The results confirm effectiveness of the framework. The components of the framework, that is the process model and the awareness model, are then used as analytical tools as input to the design of CAEOS for achieving its collaborating goals. It is suggested that the process model component of the framework to constitute foundation for the knowledge&#8209;base component of the CAEOS, whereas the awareness model of the framework to constitute foundation for the inference engine of the CAEOS'.

Abstract:
This paper presents a 2x2 matrix which focuses on individual knowledge and knowledge sharing. There is a vast amount of literature that has acknowledged that the management of knowledge is an important strategic and tactical approach to improve organizational performance. Knowledge sharing between individuals in an organization has also been recognized as a sound strategy to increase the value of the knowledge within a firm. The model presented in this paper proposes a typology of individuals that contributes to the literature both from an academic as well as a practitioner perspective; it extends the literature on knowledge management, and provides suggestions on how to aid individuals adopt a more desirable behavior that is conducive to firm survival.

Abstract:
Business Process Redesign (BPR) is undertaken to achieve order&#8209;of&#8209;magnitude improvements over 'old' form of the organisation. Practitioners in the academia and business world have developed a number of methodologies to support this competitive restructuring that forms the current focus of concern, many of which have not been successful. This paper suggests the use of Data Mining (DM) as a technique to support the process of redesigning a business by extracting the much&#8209;needed knowledge hidden in large volumes of data maintained by the organization through the DM models.

Abstract:
The objective of this study was to empirically examine through an industry survey, the impact of socialisation on organisational creativity. The results of the study show a strong and significant positive relationship between informal as well as organised forms of socialisation and creativity. The results also indicate that informal socialisation had a stronger positive effect on creativity than organised socialisation. These findings confirm the value of socialisation in innovative organisations, and suggest the need for strategies that would provide for its encouragement.

The Influence of Technical, Social and Structural Factors on the Effective use of Information in a Policing Environment
Pages:

Authors:

Abstract:
Throughout the world, police services are increasingly adopting a proactive, intelligence&#8209;led approach to crime management. These services operate within environments characterized by firm hierarchy, the command and control paradigm and high social sensitivity. The implementation of strategies for the exploitation of knowledge and information within such environments reveals particular insights into organizational knowledge management. Understanding these issues may be of great value, particularly as despite the commitment to intelligence led policing, the outcomes to date have not met expectations. This paper proposes that social and political issues have the ability to influence knowledge management strategy by drawing upon Pan and Scarbrough's socio&#8209;technical model to show the progression of the intelligence&#8209;led policing philosophy over the past decade.

The paper shows the Knowledge Value Chain (KVC) would be the best means of expressing the environment and quality condition into corporation rather than the normal value chain and the former is thus becoming more important and significant method of implementation. The Knowledge Value Chain (KVC) will be worked as a model of the knowledge management framework. In a sense, KVC will provide more details how being incorporated with the environmental factors to success the corporation requirements. Eventually, KVC will also discuss how it enabled the corporation improve and develop the most competitive advantage position. As such, it will be widely used worldwide in future as an effective means of corporation management and sustainable development.

Abstract:
This paper draws on an exploration of continuity management (CM) in a large Irish semi&#8209;state organisation in transition. Drawing on interviews with ten of the senior management team, findings are presented in terms of intellectual capital, replacement strategy, information sources, knowledge transfer to successors, tacit knowledge, CM systems, and barriers to CM implementation. There is a clear consensus in favour of introducing a CM systembut also clear recognition of the barriers, such barriers perceived to be mainly cultural.

Abstract:
This article addresses the problem of how technology adds value to an overall KM solution. It presents the core problem of KM as matching contexts using knowledge attributes and defines KM technology as that which manages knowledge attributes. The paper illustrates this by analyzing several positive and negative examples of technologies and presents two challenges for knowledge management as a field. The requirement for KM technology to manage knowledge attributes can be applied in designing effective KM solutions, selecting KM products, devising a proper KM strategy, and controlling investments in KM. The definition of KM technology also provides a focus for research to bridge gaps in technology that currently limit the widespread use of knowledge attributes.

Transformational and Transactional Leadership Predictors of the 'Stimulant' Determinants to Creativity in Organisational Work Environments

Authors:
John D. Politis
Abstract:
This paper examines the relationship between the leadership dimensions associated with Bass's (1985) model, and the 'stimulant' and 'obstacle' determinants of the work environment for creativity. There are three major findings in this research. First, the relationship between transformational and transactional leadership and the 'stimulant' determinants of the work environment for creativity is significant and positive. Second, the 'obstacle' determinants of the work environment for creativity are negatively related with both transactional and transformational leadership. Finally, transformational leadership is more strongly correlated than transactional leadership with the 'stimulant' determinants of the work environment for creativity. Thus, transformational leadership is an increasingly important aspect in today's organisations in creating a corporate culture and the work environment that stimulates employees' creativity and innovation.

The Midas Touch in Knowledge Management Projects — Beware, Your Wish Could Come True

Pär Mårtensson
Abstract:
Like king Midas, the champion of a Knowledge Management (KM) initiative might find herself in an awkward situation because the wish came true. Successful KM initiatives can lead to problems. The case study presented in this article details how a consulting company attempted to support its dispersed staff of consultants through the introduction of a web&#8209;based KM portal. The application became popular — too popular in the sense that it led to a deterioration of certain types of knowledge exchange. It achieved the intended goals, but created unforeseen problems. In the article we explore KM practices and explore the role of contexts for IT&#8209;mediated KM. It is suggested that the need to view IT&#8209;mediated KM in various wider contexts is even more important than in many other forms of IS implementation. The KM activities are not only related to identifiable tasks and work processes, but also to social interaction, learning and other dynamic processes in the organisation.

Abstract:
This paper contributes to the body of literature on knowledge sharing through insight into the relationship between the format of questions asked of individuals who are sources of knowledge and the attitudes of those that have been given the opportunity to cognitively integrate this knowledge into their own knowledge base. Aspects of the theoretical model proposed by Bircham (2003) are empirically evaluated, with results supporting the model.

To shape practice act on theories

Authors:

Abstract:
Practice based studies have provided rich descriptions of knowledge dynamics. On the other hand, they led to conceptualizations that question the possibility to view knowledge as a resource that can be oriented and shaped by managers. From this perspective, questions such as why an existing community has developed, or how to enable the emergence of a new community, are still unanswered. Such weaknesses are rooted in a tendency to ignore the cognitive motivations (theories) that lead actors to behave in a particular way. As a consequence, we propose that social practice can be explained as the outcome of interlocking cognitive theories and, moreover, that to shape practice, we need to act on theories.

Abstract:
Contrary to the "one&#8209;fits&#8209;all" approach used in the literature on how to sustain virtual communities of practice (VCoPs), this paper advocates that successful management practices should be contingent upon their basic characteristics. More specifically, this study of eight virtual communities of practice investigates how the actions taken by the communities' leadership teams may influence their success. The results show that decisions regarding the operational leadership of a VCoP are crucial elements to counteract the challenges arising from its structuring characteristics. Among those decisions, the choice and availability of a leader and the support of a coach are shown to be crucial.

A Conceptualization of Knowledge Management Practices Through Knowledge, Awareness and Meaning
Pages:

Authors:
Nathan Nifco
Abstract:
Knowledge management practices are based primarily in conceptual frameworks that are responsible for the design and development of methodologies and technologies that can provide some common ground in the way people use and manage knowledge in an organization. These conceptual frameworks are often derived from integrated perspectives that are influences not by one but multiple disciplines and practices. Can a knowledge management framework be useful and practical when is based on the universal constructs for knowledge, awareness and meaning? Operational definitions for these constructs were designed within a recent research study that was conducted by reviewing and analyzing 180 relevant sources from a variety of disciplines and practices including psychology, cognition and the cognitive sciences, human and organizational development, complexity theory and physics, computer science and artificial intelligence, philosophy, neuroscience and biology, mathematics and statistics. The operational definitions obtained from the research process were combined with general principles that were formulated in order to explore a potential model that may integrate and apply the three constructs of knowledge, awareness and meaning with the view of facilitating the conceptualization of knowledge management practices. The research presents the multiple perspectives from various disciplines on knowledge, awareness, meaning, thinking methods and organic models and at the same time provides a conceptual framework to determine the effectiveness of knowledge management practices with the purpose of integrating the know what, the know how and the know why of managing knowledge.

Title:
The Impact of Stories

Abstract:
Stories intrigue the field of Knowledge Management. Employing stories in both personnel and stakeholders communication is currently being recommended in several best practice guides on effective knowledge transfer and leadership communication. The aims of this article are to present further understanding of the impact of stories, and assess which kind of communication tasks stories are most apt for by considering stories as a medium. This allows for the examination of stories through two interlinked theories: Social Presence Theory and Media Richness Theory. These are found to be limited indicators of media effectiveness and it is suggested that elements of the theories should be broadened to make both theories useful for assessing core media effectiveness, although it is recommended that they be combined with other modes of evaluation to achieve thorough assessment of media impact.

Abstract:
This study analyzed the communication between a national rowing team and their 'virtual coach' over a period of 18 months. An exploratory analysis of 1500+ emails provided insight into how the coach successfully leveraged ubiquitous information technology to build a high performance team. Zaccaro's (2002) framework of functional leadership and Weick and Robert's (1993) framework of collective mind were applied to understand the coach's approach for developing a non&#8209;traditional semi&#8209; virtual team; the primary role of Coach was likened to that of "sense&#8209;giver" given the charge of developing a "collective mind." This study works to illustrate how ubiquitous technology like e&#8209;mails can be strategically used in the development of a high performing semi&#8209;virtual team.

Abstract:
We are not only in a new millennium, but also in a new era: the knowledge era. Sustainable competitive advantage is dependent on building and exploiting core competencies. The resource&#8209;based view (RBV) of the firm defines a strategic asset as one that is rare, valuable, imperfectly imitable and non&#8209;substitutable. Knowledge is seen as a strategic asset with the potential to be a source of competitive advantage for an organization. In this paper, we provide a model that examines how and why knowledge management (KM) can be used to create competitive advantage from the RBV of the firm.

Knowledge Generation in Developing Countries: A Theoretical Framework for Exploring Dynamic Learning in High&#8209;technology Firms
Pages:
pp87&#8209;96
Authors:
Dinar Kale

Abstract:
In the case of events such as fundamental regulatory reforms or radical technological advances, firms have to undertake discontinuous or dynamic learning. Such learning involves the generation of new capacity through the acquisition of new knowledge and the combination of it with the firm's existing accumulated knowledge. In developing countries the challenge for firms to develop new competencies through dynamic learning is more complex due to political and economic complexities. This paper discusses the limitations of existing frameworks for analysing the process aspect of transformation and proposes a theoretical framework with which to explore dynamic learning in firms from developing countries. The proposed theoretical framework is based on a constructivist approach to organisational knowledge and uses the concept of absorptive capacity. The responses of large pharmaceutical firms to biotechnological change are used to illustrate the areas under investigation. The theoretical framework is used to explore the responses of Indian pharmaceutical firms to changes in patent law required by that country's accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The cases show that the theoretical framework is comprehensive and useful for exploring firm level knowledge processes within firms from developing countries. However a broader analysis of firm&#8209;level learning in developing countries should include an analysis of the institutional environment as this plays an important role in creating environment for firm based learning.

Knowledge Creation and Sharing in a Project Team: An Organizational Analysis Based on the Concept of Organizational Relation
Pages:
pp97&#8209;106
Authors:
Piero Migliarese
Saverino Verteramo
Abstract:
In today's competitive arena, knowledge and intellectual assets management seems to be the best answer when looking to gain a competitive edge. Furthermore, traditional approaches to knowledge management based on a "single company perspective" are becoming limited; more frequently the problem is to manage "inter&#8209;organizational "collaborations, projects and temporary structures. It is thus necessary to rethink some organizational topics (organizational structures design, personnel involvement and motivation mechanisms etc.) and to review them by introducing suitable and effective modifications with respect to specific knowledge processes. This paper takes the "Organizational Relational Approach" into consideration and applies a method for describing and interpreting the interactions among organizational actors&#8209; also belonging to different organizations&#8209; defined as Organizational Relations (OR): the method analyses these relations according to several distinct dimensions: the goals of the OR and the level of sharing for the organizational actors; the organizational rules regulating the behaviour of actors within the OR; the technological and organizational tools supporting the OR; the cultural background associated to the OR. Only when all four dimensions are highly developed is it possible to qualify the existing organizational relations as "rich "or, in this context, as "knowledge intensive" relations. The paper applies the Organizational Relations method of analysis to a successful case study of knowledge transfer from the aerospace field to the health care field. We examined the joint research project carried out by the ASI,&#8209;Italian Space Agency&#8209; Ferrari DTM and two Italian Orthopaedics Departments. This project has led to the industrial production of an innovative external bone&#8209;setting device. This analysis explains the key factors for success and the effectiveness of the managerial decisions that were adopted. Empirical findings derived from the case study analysis on one hand and results obtained from the application of the Organizational Relational Method on the other have been found to be convergent and this constitutes a good validation of the method used.

Abstract:
The aim of this paper is to discuss which factors can be seen essentially affecting a company's learning ability through its organizational receptivity in inter&#8209;organizational knowledge transfer. This will be done by developing a typology of the factors affecting company's organizational receptivity (and absorptive capacity) of new knowledge in inter&#8209;organizational knowledge transfer. Yet, only after the pre&#8209;conditions for the cooperation are created, it is the individuals' abilities and the organizational culture that can essentially affect the outcome.

Abstract:
Following the biological behaviour of a tree and its growth system, this paper proposes a model of valuation of the Intellectual Capital of an organization based on a variation of the classical Lotka&#8209;Volterra equations system. The proposed model explains the growth of an organization as a consequence of its Intellectual Capital (increment of the surface of the roots), its Knowledge (the consumption of nutritious) and its Learning (fertility of the floor). And based on the proposed model, an example with real data is given.

Abstract:
Emerging as one of the most important corporate assets, there is evidence that, in some developed countries, the impact of knowledge capital in the GDP now surpasses the fixed capital. This paper uses quantitative data to broadly qualify the impact of the two main building blocks in the knowledge management integration process: information and communication technologies (ICT) and Education. The data analysis suggests that by providing efficient network platforms, knowledge can be captured, transformed and disseminated to individuals, groups and organisations. Investment in ICT seems to enable to connect people and support knowledge sharing and interpersonal interaction and therefore facilitate knowledge management processes and strategies. A case&#8209;study of Portugal is used to illustrate the conclusions drawn.

The growing phenomenon of Social Software seems to provide an opportunity to complement the top&#8209;down approach based on central knowledge repositories with tools that are simpler, smarter and more flexible. This article in&#8209; cludes a brief description of the main categories of Social Software â€” weblogs, wikis and social networking sites â€” fol&#8209; lowed by an analysis of their utilisation in relation to the five core Knowledge Management activities of the Knowledge Management taxonomy proposed by Despres & Chauvel in 1999. Examples that illustrate the support Social Software could provide for knowledge management are presented. Finally, some of the problems that hinder the usage of Social Software tools, together with some of the latest developments and trends in the field are mentioned.

Abstract:
Intellectual capital has been described as intangible assets that may be used as a source of sustainable com&#8209; petitive advantage. However, intellectual capital components have to interact, to create value. Previous studies demon&#8209; strate that intellectual capital is positively and significantly associated with organizational performance. Our aim is to con&#8209; solidate these findings, examining the inter&#8209;relationships and the interaction effects among intellectual capital compo&#8209; nents and organizational performance, in the Portuguese banking context.

Complexity Theory and Knowledge Management Application

Authors:

Abstract:
This article traces the development of complexity theories and proposes a Complexity Representation Model (CRM) for management processes. The purpose here was to translate key elements of complexities theories (e.g. self organisation, adaption, co&#8209;evolution, chaos) into a recognisable form and relate these to management practice (particu&#8209; larly knowledge management and learning).  A further Complexity Application Model (CAM) is offered that shows the relationship between the formal and informal aspects of the management environment and the CRM. It models an active environment that should learn and adapt to minor perturbations and major schisms. It is a conceptual guide as to the "ideal" management system, one that self&#8209; organises, learns, adapts and evolves with its environment. The application of the CAM is discussed in terms of practical methods and processes that can be used to manage and encourage managers to feel they are in control of a complex adaptive management system.

Lighting up 'Blind Spots' while Measuring Knowledge Capital

Authors:

Abstract:
Practical experiences in developing and introducing performance measurements systems for measuring and managing knowledge capital have shown that these instruments do not sufficiently fulfil the expectations of their users. Some authors even point out that the fundamental understanding of methodological and conceptual issues is inade&#8209;quate. Therefore, we suggest that instead of creating further new instruments, an explanation of how and when Perform&#8209;ance Measurement Systems (PMS) become effective is necessary. We argue that highlighting their potential production of "blind spots" and comprehending the use of PMS more reflexively will bring more sustainable effects. As a result, the concept of First and Second Order Reflection of PMS is introduced.

Abstract:
This paper describes a Process Framework for an Interoperable Semantic Enterprise Environment (PF&#8209;ISEE) for conceptualising knowledge by coupling business process activities and the Knowledge Transfer Cycle. The PF&#8209;ISEE is triggered by an activity and starts the Knowledge Transfer Cycle. The Knowledge Transfer Cycle provides six core concepts with methods, tools and templates to create, manipulate, store and retrieve information. Within the Knowledge Transfer Cycle, special methods are applied in the context of knowledge intensive business process activities with a rep&#8209; resentation model that can be a global, role depended or an application inherited concept representation. The paper in&#8209; troduces the main advantages and challenges of each core concept and explains its position in the Knowledge Transfer Cycle. Furthermore, it is shown how the PF&#8209;ISEE can be part of an Enterprise Semantic Web in order to integrate se&#8209; mantic tools and technologies in standard enterprise applications.

This paper reports research to investigate how tourist organisations based in Africa acquire, disseminate and apply knowledge through their websites. Interactivity is the key to put information into context to become knowledge. A survey found there are some interactive knowledge&#8209;transfer tools provided on the websites of African tourist organisa&#8209; tions, but only on the few, fully&#8209;fledged e&#8209;commerce websites was knowledge transfer being effectively utilised. The au&#8209; thors recommend that organisations incorporate more tools to acquire and apply knowledge as it is fundamental for e&#8209; commerce success.

This paper contributes to our understanding of knowledge creation by developing a comprehensive model of the knowledge creating process in organisational work teams. It subsequently synthesises contemporary theory across research streams to develop hypotheses relating to three factors capable of facilitating the knowledge development process â€” cognitive diversity, transactional memory and open&#8209;mindedness norms. In combination, the conceptual ration&#8209; ale and empirical support act to substantiate three key relationships in the knowledge creation process.

Abstract:
Business intelligence (BI) is a managerial concept and tool that is used to help organisations to manage busi&#8209;ness information and to make effective decisions. Measurement of BI is generally considered an important issue but at the same time it is considered difficult to carry out in practice. There is also a lack of research on the topic. The paper describes the current knowledge regarding the measurement of BI and makes a contribution on the currently small amount of empirical knowledge on the topic. The research is implemented by means of a literature review and action research.

Abstract:
Interorganizational and social relationships can be seen as part of the intellectual capital of a firm. Existing frameworks of intellectual capital, however, fail to address how relationships should be managed to generate more intellectual capital. Drawing on the interaction approach and the fields of intellectual capital and knowledge management, this paper develops a framework for managing relationships. The framework is illustrated with a case study. It is also noted that firms can improve relationship management and thus generate more intellectual capital.

Abstract:
The shared use of specialist terminology amongst the members of a community of practice is explored as evidence for the existence of the concept of terminology is described â€” this method uses both univariate analysis, specifically frequency distribution of single and compound words, and multivariate statistical analysis, particularly factor analysis. The results show that terminology sharing may act as a metric for knowledge sharing and knowledge diffusion among different (sub&#8209;) communities. The case study chosen to demonstrate the efficacy of the terminology&#8209;sharing method is drawn from breast cancer care, where texts produced for and by the three main components of the community are examined â€” namely the experts, the professionals and the patients. The shared use of specialist terminology amongst the members of a community of practice is explored as evidence for the existence of the concept of communal lexicon. A computer&#8209;based method of investigating the extent of terminology is described â€” this method uses both univariate analysis, specifically frequency distribution of single and compound words, and multivariate statistical analysis, particularly factor analysis. The results show that terminology sharing may act as a metric for knowledge sharing and knowledge diffusion among different (sub&#8209;) communities. The case study chosen to demonstrate the efficacy of the terminology&#8209;sharing method is drawn from cancer care â€” especially breast cancer care, where texts produced for and by the three main components of the community are examined â€” namely the experts, the professionals and the patients.

Knowledge Sharing Practices: Analysis of a Global Scandinavian Consulting Company

Authors:

Abstract:
In a knowledge economy landscape, successful global consulting firms are the ones putting focus on effectively and efficiently organising and managing the highly distributed diversified knowledge in the organisation. In order to sustain their competitive advantage, knowledge&#8209;companies need to harness knowledge and to analyse knowledge sharing mechanisms and learning in the whole organisation. Knowledge sharing in global firms is a not only a cross&#8209;department process but it should also take place within the same department. It is well recognised that the knowledge sharing mechanism is a highly complex process to put in place and to promote in the organisation. The primary goal of our research is to empirically investigate knowledge sharing and learning mechanisms within a global consulting company. The phenomenology discipline has guided our research methodology because it is the most appropriate approach for coping with the social complexity of management and business. Our research approach intends to make social sense from the knowledge sharing practices and observations conducted in order to understand how and what is shared.

Abstract:
This paper presents recent research findings on the effects of organizational knowledge management (KM) context on KM practices. Data were collected at a large Canadian law firm via a Web&#8209;based survey instrument from over 400 participants comprising professional and support staff working in various office locations. The purpose of the study was to gain insight on the antecedents of knowledge management behaviors in organizations. A theoretical model explicating the impact of an organization's KM environment on both organizational and individual KM behaviors was developed and tested using structural equation modeling techniques. The moderating effects of age, biological sex, job category, and years spent in the organization were also examined. Results indicate that an organization's knowledge management environment impacts on both organizational as well as personal knowledge management behaviors. Furthermore, we show that organizational KM behavior also influences personal KM behavior, thus acting as a mediator between the overarching organizational knowledge management policies and practices and the employees' individual practices. Based on this empirical evidence, recommendations are suggested for organizations wishing to institutionalize knowledge management initiatives in their firms.

Abstract:
Knowledge transfer is no longer reducible to classical solutions such as face&#8209;to&#8209;face training, technical education or tutoring. Knowledge to be transferred is professional knowledge (Business Knowledge). It involves the whole Knowledge Capital within an organization. Identifying the knowledge components that are worthwhile transferring is not an easy task. This is the problem addressed in this paper.

Knowledge Management Methodologies

Abstract:
Knowledge management (KM) research and practice embraces a wide range of activities and interests. The KM domain covers, on the one hand, technological interventions that aim to support knowledge dissemination and, on the other hand, to appreciation of social approaches that bring people together to share their experiences. The former represents an earlier bias in the field while the latter is more indicative of the current emphasis. Such a shift in emphasis has called for a shift in the way that the research and practice is undertaken; this paper focuses on research activities and asserts the appropriateness of a particular methodology for todays knowledge management research.  This paper will firstly consider the range of research methodologies that have been employed in knowledge management research. It will move on to consider the use of one particular research methodology, ethnography, as a framework for understanding the more personal elements of knowledge. It is contended that use of ethnography, which emphasises observation within a compact cultural setting, offers a potentially ideal method of undertaking research in knowledge management because it concentrates on a community and in the provision of descriptions of how members of the community interact with each other. Utilisation of ethnography as a research method sits comfortably with theories of knowledge, which acknowledge the tacit element of knowledge and its experiential embeddedness; ethnography is therefore put forward as a meaningful methodology for contemporary knowledge management research.

Effects of Knowledge Representation on Knowledge Acquisition and Problem Solving

Authors:

Abstract:
The way knowledge is represented influences the effectiveness with which that knowledge can be shared and reconstructed. Of particular interest to this study is the hypertext knowledge representation. Based on the schema theory, we propose a model explaining the effect of the hypertext knowledge representation on the user's problem solving performance.  The sophistication of the knowledge structure that the user can construct from the hypertext knowledge representation is proposed as an intervening variable mediating the effect of hypertext on the problem solving performance. According to our model, the hypertext representation of the "collective schemata" of a group of experts allows the user to acquire a more complex and better integrated knowledge structure that is more similar to the experts' than does a linear representation. The model further hypothesizes that the complexity, integration and degree of similarity of an individual's schemata to that of domain experts in turn improves significantly the individual's problem solving performance. Compared to the linear representation, the hypertext representation of expert knowledge is expected to improve the quality of problem solving in the organization through the facilitation of the acquisition of more sophisticated knowledge structures by the users. A field experiment was used to verify the hypotheses of our model. This research demonstrates the important role of hypertext knowledge representation in supporting knowledge construction and problem solving.

Abstract:
Over the last decade we have seen the emergence of an economy in which the digital component has become a constant presence in all areas of knowledge. In the digital world, characterised and dominated by a complex connectivity, value assumes a complex meaning, which is strongly distinct from that used in the traditional economy. There are new business concepts, new strategies based on innovation, new mechanisms to create value, and a new need â€” to build methodologies and metrics that can measure and reflect it.

Abstract:
The purpose of this article is to analyze how knowledge creation within production process verification units within companies and knowledge transfer between product development and production units are affected by the use of virtual prototypes. The analysis shows that the use of virtual prototypes has a negative effect on knowledge creation and transfer. However, increased degrees of acceptance regarding the new method combined with improved technical level are anticipated to reduce these negative effects.

Abstract:
At a time when there is a lot of debate as to what 'knowledge' means in organisations MaKE First Steps provides a practical way of addressing the issue in organisations. It is a practical approach for collaboratively defining knowledge in organisations in such a way that the definition that is created fits an organisation's needs, context and preferences. This paper describes and explains how the process works, how it was tested in a commercial environment and the results of that research. This work is highly relevant to both academics and practitioners, and the author argues that this is an excellent way for employees in organisations to commence knowledge management (KM) practically.

Authors:
Maria Solitander
Abstract:
The aim of this paper is to analyze different strategies for protecting knowledge in interorganisational collaborative relationships, based on intellectual capital (IC) theory. Previous research has stressed the need for the flows between structural, human and relational capital to work properly, i.e. that the firm has a broad bandwidth of communication. Firms involved in interorganisational collaborative relationships need to be able to manage the IC flows in order to make the communication run smoothly, while limiting involuntary leakage of strategically important knowledge. The paper examines the strategies aimed at keeping the balance between sharing and protecting knowledge identified in a multinational firm with extensive experience of close collaboration with partners that are partly also competitors.

Knowledge Cooperation in Online Communities: a Duality of Participation and Cultivation

Abstract:
This paper is an attempt to answer the question "How to design for engagement in community&#8209;oriented knowledge management?" In order to do this we need an approach that has its primary focus on distinguishing, balancing, connecting and negotiating between knowledge in its two fundamental dimensions: individual and social. The concept of "knowledge cooperation" that we have defined as the participative cultivation of knowledge in a voluntary, informal social group", is our proposal for fulfilling the previously mentioned requirements. After introducing this definition of "knowledge cooperation" with its background in community&#8209;oriented knowledge management, we will explain and give reasons for its constitutive elements and their unique combination in our approach. On this basis we will then describe the two coupled learning loops (participation and cultivation) which in our conception characterise the dynamics of knowledge cooperation and argue for the importance of looking at participation and cultivation as an interacting duality. Our main message is that the duality of participation and cultivation that constitutes our model of knowledge cooperation allows us both a better understanding of knowledge processes in an online community and to design active, dynamic, healthy communities where cultivating knowledge and participation in cultivating that knowledge mutually activates and sustains each other.

Alternative Accounting to Manage Intellectual Capital
Pages:

Authors:
GyÃ¶rgy Boda
Peter SzlÃ¡vik
Abstract:
The connection of intangible assets to cash flow generation is a major management issue. In addition, a majority of the investment is made in the intangible capital items. This paper intends to present an approach that supports the continuous measurement of intangible assets and allows an extended value based management framework that considers both tangible and intangible elements.  The value of a company includes significant elements that are not described by the generally accepted accounting methods such as relationship capital, organizational capital, and knowledge and competence of employees. These elements are possible to be presented in an expanded balance sheet.  We face challenges when we try to quantify the elements for a concrete date or when we intend to capture the exact changes throughout a certain period. Based on generally accepted accounting standards, the investment into intellectual assets is mostly handled as cost. This cost is accountable against the revenue of the period therefore decreasing the period's profit. This approach does not allow the carrying forward of any cost element for future periods, even in the case of a long term cost.  If we reconsider our cost management framework and the costs that serve the development or replacement of intellectual capital items we manage as capital expenditures in intellectual capital items and not as a period's expense, we could build up a ground&#8209;up approach to the handling of intellectual capital items. This approach results in the compilation of two balance sheets and profit & loss accounts that are alternative versions of each other. The visualization of intellectual assets and intellectual capital might significantly change the decision making process and the general thinking of the management.  The authors suggest further research in order to support the development of the conceptual framework and the operational rules of practice.

Abstract:
Interdisciplinary project teams foster the creation of new ideas and innovations to meet customer needs and to challenge competition under the pre&#8209;condition that the team and knowledge transfer processes are running smoothly and efficiently. In practice knowledge created in projects often is lost when the team splits up and the members return to their tasks in the organisation. This leads to inefficiency as time and money is spent in inventing things, which are already known inside the organisation. The case study outlines how knowledge and potentials for improvement can be explored and synergies can be realised. 0ur approach offers guidelines to accumulate transfer and utilize knowledge acquired in projects to improve future business. Through a knowledge&#8209;oriented concept the consulting and software implementation process of the case study's company is optimised. This offers the possibility to integrate organisational change management know&#8209;how and furthermore it gives the opportunity for a critical reflection of finished and ongoing projects. In this process "best practices" and "lessons learned" are explored to foster a better planning and realisation of projects on the long run.

Abstract:
The topic of Community&#8209;of&#8209;Practice (CoP) has been discussed in the management literature in the earlier part of 1990's, and since attracted a lot of attention from academics and professionals around the globe. Communities of Practice (CoP) have become a strategic approach for fostering learning and transferring knowledge. However, there are a few studies, which explain what makes a community to engage in a discussion to share their knowledge and experience. This paper discusses the anatomy of a CoP, and examines a number of knowledge management tools such as story telling and discourse analysis to illustrate how knowledge is transferred and learning takes place in a virtual Community of Practice. Results are presented from a 'live' virtual community of practice, which is in the maturity period of its life cycle to discuss the role of domain experts and moderators how they facilitate to engage the community in dialogues and help generate the new knowledge. Also using Nonaka and Takeuchi's knowledge spiral model it is explained how learning takes place in this virtual community of practice.

Knowledge Creation through University&#8209;Industry Collaborative Research Projects

Authors:
Julie Hermansand Annick Castiaux
Abstract:
It is obvious from the study of literature that university&#8209;industry (U&#8209;I) relationships and their subsequent knowledge transfers are topics of high political, economical, managerial and academic interest. Indeed, technological knowledge is seen as a major source of long&#8209;term economic growth and its transfer to the firm is critical since it acts as a significant innovation factor. In order to access this knowledge, a portfolio of sourcing strategies is available to the firm: knowledge creation through internal RandD departments, knowledge sharing with suppliers or market relationships, and also transfer from knowledge institutions such as public and private research centres. In this paper, we recognISe that University is a central source of knowledge but we question the general belief that knowledge is per se flowing between private and academic sphere through the conduct of University&#8209;Industry relationships. As a result, this paper presents our literature analysis concerning this research topic and explores one particular mean of inter&#8209;organisational knowledge transfer, namely the University&#8209;Industry collaborative research project. We present findings from an exploratory study, which aims at examining knowledge flows and collaborative behaviours at stake in such research projects. This interview survey has been realised with respondents actively involved in Belgian university&#8209;industry (U&#8209;I) interactions and provides qualitative data analysed through the theoretical framework of organisational knowledge creation developed by Nonaka and Takeuchi. We found evidence supporting the existence of a knowledge spiral as a dynamic for the whole projects and identified some knowledge&#8209;based limits to the reconciliation process between university's interests and company's needs.

Notions of Knowledge Management Systems: A Gap Analysis

Authors:

Abstract:
Knowledge management, now a distinct domain of research and practice, has roots in many disciplines. As a result, a wide variety of philosophies, theories, and definitions of knowledge management are used in the literature, and in practice. This has led to many models and methodologies being used in developing knowledge management systems, but without sufficient cross&#8209;pollination of ideas from the various influences and adopted philosophies. We argue that this has led to significant gaps in the understanding of what is needed for knowledge management systems and to divergent and inadequate models and methodologies. These problems are hindering both research and practice. Fieldwork in knowledge management systems development for organisations has been supplemented by an in&#8209;depth analysis of the literature, which has revealed particular gaps in knowledge management systems research. The notions that should underpin knowledge management systems development are confused and incomplete. This paper summarises the most salient of these and challenges several of the published notions of knowledge, knowledge management, and models of knowledge management. In particular we challenge the apparently accepted dichotomies and propose how different facets can be considered within a matrix of KM models.

Abstract:
This paper presents a study about the idea of structurally managing individuals' affections, i.e. affects, in relation to the organisational learning process. The instrument under investigation has been TABLe MATRIX â€” 'The Affect Based Learning Matrix'; a structured tool, based on the cognitive therapeutic process, to be used to identify affects and thus aiding in making analyses in relation to an organisational occurrence or change (coming or already existing), a subject, or a problem. In order to evaluate the approach, we have interviewed thirteen management representatives from Human Resources andor Operational Development within following branches: Medicine, Finance, Education, Retail Fast Moving Consumer Goods, Manufacturing, Travel and Transportation, Construction, and the Public Sector and Religious Communities. The evaluation shows a great interest among the respondents in visualising affects in relation to learning.

Organisational Knowledge Transfer: Turning Research into Action through a Learning History

Julie BÃ©liveau
Abstract:
Organisational learning and knowledge management experts are searching for more appropriate research tools to tackle the difficult concepts of organisational learning and knowledge. This paper provides an overview of the learning history methodology, first proposed by Kleiner and Roth, in studying knowledge transfer activities. The learning history methodology, typically used within an action research environment, is designed to allow recognition of what has been learned in the past to guide stakeholders in the dialogical generation of a new future. It is a qualitative measurement tool of what has been learned, and remains sensitive to contextual factors, since it is based on the perceptions of the organisation's actors and the theoretical sensitivity of the researcher. This paper surveys the learning history literature to determine the roots, benefits and challenges of this research method. We will then demonstrate the advantages of using this approach to studying organisational knowledge transfer by presenting a case study where it is being used within participatory action research logic. Finally, we will provide lessons learned from our ongoing research and draw on implications for practice and future theorising.

Authors:
Mirva Peltoniemi
Abstract:
This paper explores the motivation for information exchange between firms within a knowledge&#8209;intensive industry. The qualitative empirical data is gathered from the Finnish games industry. The industry is seen as a complex system that changes through an evolutionary process. There are three main explanations for such collective efforts. First, the firms want to help each other in order to create critical mass at the national scale. Second, selection operates more strongly at the group level between industries than within the industry. Third, information exchange makes their search functions more effective allowing collective search.

Actors and Factors: Virtual Communities for Social Innovation

Diana D. Woolis
Abstract:
Virtual communities of practice (COPs) are fast becoming a basic work unit in a networked world. The relationship between COPs, Knowledge Management, and the Learning Organisation is a question of priority for social sector leaders, researchers, policy makers, and practitioners as they seek to establish ways to maintain relevance and effectiveness in the volatile environments in which they work (Thomas et al, 2005). When well executed, virtual COPs produce results because the knowledge is stewarded: organised for learning, poised for action, and planned for sustainability. In this paper, we document and analyse the actors and factors that, in our experience, contribute to success: Enlightened Leadership, Compelling Work, Appropriate Technology and Knowledge Sustainability. Over the last two years we have worked with new virtual COPs in both the public and non&#8209;profit sectors. The outsized successes prove the power of this approach to work. The under&#8209;performers help define the parameters for more effective implementations. Perhaps surprisingly, the critical success factors for a high&#8209;performing virtual COP have absolutely nothing to do with technological aptitude. The two key determinants of community success harken back to Business Management 101: the strategic clarity and capacity for collaborative leadership in the organisation, and the specificity and practicality of the community mission.

Journalists, the Makers and Breakers of Relational Capital

Authors:
Joanna Sinclair
Abstract:
The aim of this paper is twofold. First, to call attention to why storytelling is a pivotal building block of Relational Capital and second, to provide an understanding of how stories receive media coverage, in essence explain how PR professionals seek to influence the business press into telling stories about their client companies and how journalists in turn react to the story material sent to them by PR departments. This paper approaches this issue through gatekeeping theory and presents an example of the various gatekeepers affecting the media coverage of corporate stories. Although the paper includes theoretical reflection, it chiefly attempts to bring new insights to the topic by providing empirical research results. The paper reports findings from a qualitative analysis of semi&#8209;structured, in&#8209;depth interviews conducted with six journalists from the Finnish business press and six Finnish PR Professionals. The article shows three types of stories that PR professionals use to lure the business press into writing news about their client companies. These are: 1) an idea of a story 2) a hidden story and 3) a ready&#8209;made story. The article concludes in showing that an idea of a story will be appealing to business journalists, especially if the story is not obviously helping a commercial enterprise improve their image. It shows that a hidden story, however, can be appealing to business journalists even if the story would clearly improve a commercial enterprise's image. The ready&#8209;made story, though, is found to be appealing to journalists chiefly as background information that might trigger a later story.

Exploring Knowledge Processes in User&#8209;Centred Design

Authors:
Kaisa Still
Abstract:
This research focuses on analysing knowledge processes of the design process, especially the early phases of the design process that can be called concept design. It aims at developing a body of knowledge that builds on the relevant issues toward user&#8209;centred design in a form of a framework. This is intended to apply, organise and synthesise processes, theories and concepts from the separate but linked disciplines of knowledge management and human&#8209; computer interaction, hence addressing one of the most essential topics and goals of system design, i.e. how to define what is needed in the system and how the system should mediate human activitiesÂ„for the purposes of this research, in the context of interest&#8209;based communities and mobile technology. The framework is based on the following propositions: (1) The participants of design process include designers and users as actors, both of which are seen to possess knowledge needed toward successful design; (2) this knowledge is proposed to be context&#8209;specific, hence being specific for certain users using certain technology; (3) for the user as well as for the design professional there are some things that are known but have not been articulated; and (4) the knowledge processes transforming tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge by users and designers are linked and need to be combined, finally (5) toward knowledge embedded into concepts, products, or services. Overall, the research highlights how knowledge processes enable user involvement and capturing tacit (and novel) user knowledge toward successful concept designdesign.

Partaking as a Tool for Knowledge Creation and Sharing in Practice

Abstract:
In this paper evidence that sustain the importance of partaking in promoting knowledge creation and sharing, is gathered from a recent study of optimisation of a corrugated cardboard machine. The investigating method is action research combined with the theoretical views of the SCOT approach (Pinch and Bijker, 1989; Latour, 1987; Law, 1992). It is revealed how inclusion of workers in discussion concerning their workplace, promotes an ownership to their work. This was accomplished by creating a trusting environment allowing workers to speak open and freely (Webb et. al, 2002). Hence knowledge creation and sharing concentrates on those who need the knowledge which is developed. In reality what happened in this project was a redistribution of power and influence (Lukes, 1974).

Abstract:
The Bologna declaration aims at providing solutions for the problems and challenges of European Higher Education. One of its main goals is the introduction of a common framework of transparent and comparable degrees that ensures the recognition of knowledge and qualifications of citizens all across the European Union. This paper will discuss an ontology&#8209;based model that supports the creation of transparent curricula content (Educational Ontology) and the promotion of reliable knowledge testing (Adaptive Knowledge Testing System). Beside the description of the evolution of the Educational Ontology, which has been developed within a research project by the Department of Information Systems, role of the ontology in managing, mapping and sharing the knowledge of curricula will be discussed in details as well. The Educational Ontology addresses establishing relation between the requirements of labour markets and the content of curricula through competencies that can be acquired during a given training program. Another critical aspect of this research concerns the measuring of knowledge. The second part of the paper will focus on the possibilities of adaptive knowledge testing and describes how a suitably elaborated ontology model can support adaptive testing of students by enabling a detailed exploration of missing knowledge and knowledge areas.

The Dissemination and Adoption of Knowledge Management Practices Behavioural Model

pp131&#8209;142
Authors:
Raul M. Abril
Abstract:
Moving a global consulting organisation from an attitude based on individuals' "knowledge is power" to the advocated principles of knowledge sharing is a challenge that requires facilitation. This paper studies a real global consulting organisation that recognised that important firm resources like processes, technology and capital were not enough in order to drive the required attitudinal change. Details are presented about the lessons learned from a couple of unsuccessful past knowledge management programs and from a successful implementation of a knowledge enablement program involving agents as facilitators of attitudinal change. Some of the lessons learned were that (i) action research components were of help harvesting knowledge assets from tacit knowledge, (ii) perceived value moderates the motivation of associates to participate in the knowledge enablement program, and (iii) knowledge practice owners should perform their agentic task as consultants. A topic for discussion is if the prior knowledge of knowledge practice owners on a given knowledge domain is a requirement to facilitate an attitudinal change.

Knowledge Management in the Brazilian Organisational Context: a shift towards the concept of "Ba"
Pages:
pp143&#8209;152
Authors:
RivadÃ¡via C. Drummond de Alvarenga Neto
Abstract:
The paper investigates the theme known as "Knowledge Management" (KM) in three large Brazilian organisations trying to discuss its concepts, constituent elements, managerial approaches and tools, while aiming at leaving behind the purely terminological discussion, which is innocuous and naive. The basic presuppositions were two: (i) most of what is referred to or named KM is actually "Information Management" (IM) and IM is just one of the components of KM. KM is more than simply IM due to the fact that it includes and incorporates other concerns, such as the creation, use and sharing of information and knowledge in the organisational context; (ii) a conceptual model or map can be formulated based on three basic concepts: (a) a strategic concept of information and knowledge, (b) the introduction of such strategy in the tactical and operational levels through the several managerial approaches and information technology tools and (c) the creation of an organisational space for knowledge. The main objective is to investigate and analyse the concepts, motivations, practices and results of KM effectively implemented in three large Brazilian organisations. The qualitative research strategy used was the study of multiple cases with incorporated units of analysis and three criteria were observed for the judgment of the quality of the research project: validity of the construct, external validity and reliability. Multiple sources of evidence were used and data analysis consisted of three flows of activities: data reduction, data displays and conclusion drawingverification. The results confirmed the presuppositions and the fact that KM means a rethinking of management practices in the information era. Knowledge as such cannot be managed; it is just promoted or stimulated through the creation of a favourable organisational context, namely "Ba". It was also identified that the main challenges facing organisations committed to KM have its focus on change management, cultural and behavioural issues and the creation of an enabling context that favours the creation, use and sharing of information and knowledge.

Abstract:
Technology has always played an important role in medical science by contributing to health care development. The use of technological instruments helps diagnostics of normal and pathologic states; and thus leads to a better understanding of human physiology. Once a diagnosis is established, a suitable treatment or surgical intervention can be considered, according to the available clinical capacities. In the last four decades, research in biomedical engineering science has led to the manufacturing of cutting edge medical instruments. For example, the introduction of endoscopes into surgical practice is considered one of the biggest success stories in the history of medicine. However in order to develop appropriate medical instruments or procedures, one key issue for successful biomedical research is the ability to understand in an efficient way the requirements of the medical practitioners. Furthermore, the two main actors namely biomedical universities and the biomedical industry involved in the development of new technologies need to collaborate and cooperate to a greater extent. This paper discusses the role and the process of knowledge flow between the various stakeholders involved in the design of medical instruments. The aim is the delineation of a general framework facilitating the understanding of the technical and medical requirements in order to develop new tools and methods.

The Story of Knowledge: Writing Stories that Guide Organisations into the Future
Pages:
pp161&#8209;172
Authors:
John P Girard
Sandra Lambert
Abstract:
Many organisational gurus highlight the value of oral narrative or storytelling as a catalyst for organisational change or a way to share knowledge. Tomes of articles describe seasoned raconteurs single handedly inciting enormous transformation in organisations. Oxymoronically many written works are describing the power of oral narrative. Surely these printed exposÃ©s are themselves motivators for change; so why the continued emphasis on the face&#8209;to&#8209;face storytelling? There is no disputing the fact that oral narrative is a powerful form of communicating; however, it is not always feasible. In fact, there are times when the written word packs a more powerful punch. Often it is simply not possible to catch the ear of a wide audience simultaneously, or even at all. Many people simply will not take time from their busy schedules to listen to stories. Busy executives seem to prefer the written word to the spoken. In these cases, the power of the pen offers a persuasive substitute. This is a tale about such stories in action, each of which seemed to sow the seed of change. Of course, time will be the real test; however, anecdotal evidence seems to support the proposition that well&#8209;written futuristic stories provide an excellent alternative to face&#8209;to&#8209;face oral narrative. At least in these examples, the written story proved to be a motivator for organisational change and an effective way to share knowledge. This paper is about the use of narrative to share knowledge; it is part tutorial and part theory. Building on the foundational knowledge developed by Denning, Snowden, Prusak, and others this paper describes the "how to" of effective storytelling to create and share knowledge within organisations.

Tacit Knowledge Revisited â€” We Can Still Learn from Polanyi
Pages:
pp173&#8209;180
Authors:
Kenneth A. Grant
Abstract:
The field of knowledge management is still relatively new, with all but a few of its related papers and books published during the last 15 years or so. However, one of the most cited sources is a much earlier work on the topic of tacit and explicit knowledge, by Michael Polanyi (1958 and 1966). An examination of some 60 papers from three major knowledge management journals demonstrates that Polanyi's work has frequently been misinterpreted by some authors and further suggests that, in some cases, the citing authors may not have read the cited work. Further, this has led to misinterpretation of Polanyi's work in ways that have affected wider issues in knowledge management. Polanyi's work is still relevant today and a closer examination of his theory that all knowledge has personal and tacit elements, such that knowledge cannot be made fully explicit, can be used to both support and refute a variety of widely held approaches to knowledge management. In particular, it raises issue about the continued efforts to make knowledge explicit through the use of information systems, without consideration of wider social issues, as well as refuting those who use the issue of tacit knowledge to dismiss the field of knowledge management as a misguided concept. It provides support for more recent work on next generation knowledge management.

Andrew Kok
Abstract:
Aspects such as human capital, structural capital and customer capital are important variables of the whole intellectual capital management programme, which forms part of the knowledge management initiatives of institutes of higher learning. The skills and expertise of university staff as part of its human capital are discussed. Structural capital will encompass aspects such as the role of innovation and intellectual property rights. Customer capital of the university and the knowledge of stakeholders in the field of tertiary education are becoming more important. The results of a study done at a South African university are used to indicate which of these aspects needs to be measured and a new framework for measurement and management of IC is discussed.

Abstract:
Intangibles have emerged in the last decade as an important issue among companies' accounting theories. Companies have implemented strategies based on the robustness of their own intellectual capital. Competitive advantage is based on the capacity to anticipate, innovate and make shared use of opportunities. In the air transportation sector, strong changes have also occurred â€” traditional value chains based on linear activities alignment, were replaced by a new perspective: the innovation cycle (specific intangibles recognition associated with new business models) and its impact on the operational cycle. This paper presents a theoretical framework approach about intangible assets identification and valuation in the air transportation sector as a whole. The first step of this empirical evidence is based on the Portuguese Airlines companies.

Abstract:
Existing relevant literature regarding approaches to context formalisation is analysed in search of a characterisation that explains the links â€” suggested by knowledge theory of the firm â€” between knowledge integration capability and common knowledge types. The ontological and the syntactic&#8209;semantic&#8209;pragmatic continuum approaches reveal an extensive description of context, which contributes to the understanding of the knowledge integration process, and to an eventual operationalisation of common knowledge types. This theoretical development opens possibilities for the elaboration of prescriptive models that support the integration of knowledge during routine operations of the organisation.

Abstract:
The Information Resources Management College is the largest of four colleges of National Defence University, the pre&#8209;eminent U.S. graduate&#8209;level institution responsible for educating military and civilian senior leaders across government for national security. The college, dedicated to developing information leaders who can leverage information and information technology for strategic advantage, is rapidly becoming an adaptive enterprise. The college is transforming into a "sense&#8209;and&#8209;respond" organisation (Haeckel, 1999), that is increasingly netcentric and agile, an essential quality for survival in a dynamic Information Age environment. By engaging more directly with stakeholders, the college is sensing the learning needs of government organisations. In response it is re&#8209;designing current, and designing new, educational programs, re&#8209;framing its courses into professional development seminars, and designing tailored educational services to meet the learning needs of government organisations. Via its large distributed learning program, the college reaches students around the world, and is expanding its current global reach by supporting communities of practice aligned with perceived stakeholder interests. It is also encouraging faculty participation with networks of government, academic, and private sector colleagues to enrich learning. Cross&#8209;boundary communication, collaboration, and leadership are valued as essential to better government and the agility of the college, and are infused as curricular and organisational goals. As part of its transformation, college leaders streamlined the organisational design to create teams of faculty to develop and deliver programs. Replacing command&#8209;and&#8209;control systems, the leaders are adapting the organisational context by re&#8209;framing the organisation's reason for being, governing principles, and high&#8209;level business process design. While continuing to offer credit&#8209;bearing courses and programs consistent with the academic traditions of a graduate school, the college is transforming from a "make&#8209;and&#8209;sell" organisation to a "sense&#8209;and&#8209;respond" organisation that models agility in today's information&#8209;driven federal government environment.

Haris Papoutsakis
Abstract:
Knowledge has long ago been recognised as an important asset for sustaining competitive advantage. Recently, the use of information technologies for knowledge&#8209;sharing within an organisation is identified as an important tool for managing organisational knowledge in order to improve business performance. This paper starts with a retrospective analysis of the basic theories that during the course of the 20 century, gave birth to the Knowledge&#8209;based Theory of the Firm. Then it focuses on Knowledge Sharing within the organisation, and the Knowledge Sharing Networks that facilitate this complicated task. Through an empirical study, it evaluates the role and the level of contribution of Information Technology functions and infrastructure among knowledge&#8209;sharing groups, for their relationship and the organisation's performance. Finally, building upon both the theoretical analysis and the empirical results, the paper concludes with guidelines that help management to overcome existing barriers and at the same time, make Knowledge Sharing Networks the backbone of their knowledge&#8209;sharing infrastructure.

In Search of an Intellectual Capital Comprehensive Theory
Pages:

Authors:
JosÃ© MarÃ­a Viedma MartÃ­
Abstract:
The development of intellectual capital theory has been guided by the ideas and thoughts of a handful of influential practitioners, including Karl Erik Sveiby (1997), RS Kaplan (Kaplan and Norton, 1992) and Leif Edvinson (Edvinson and Malone, 1997). These pioneers established the basis of the "intellectual capital standard theory". In the present paper the assumptions and principles that support the standard theory (the prevailing paradigm) are discussed. The paper then introduces other models and methodologies as alternatives to the standard theoryÂ„such as the "Value Explorer" (Andriessen and Tissen, 2000) and the "Intellectual Capital Benchmarking System (ICBS)" (Viedma, 2001)Â„ and examines the foundations and principles on which the alternative new theory (the 'new paradigm') is based. Finally, the paper attempts to synthesise both of these theoretical approaches with other new views and contributions, and tries to develop the basis for a first general theory of intellectual capital.

A Theory&#8209;Based Approach to the Relationship between Social Capital and Communities of Practice
Pages:
pp257&#8209;264
Authors:
El-Sayed Abou-Zeid
Abstract:
There is almost a consensus that tacit component of organisational knowledge is of critical strategic importance because, unlike explicit knowledge, it is both inimitable and appropriable. Because of its characteristics, organisational tacit knowledge is usually created and shared through highly interactive conversation and shared experience, i.e., through a socialisation process. At the firm's level, the effectiveness of the socialisation process depends on the firm's social capital. At group level, it has been argued that communities of practice form the basis of a firm's ability to create and share tacit knowledge. Therefore, investigating the relationship between social capital, communities of practice and individual human action is crucial in understanding the dynamic of cross level knowledge creation and utilisation and in understanding organisational learning process. In order to study this relationship Giddens' theory of structuration is used as it provides an integrating meta&#8209;theory that recognises social reality as constituted by both subjective human actors and by objective institutional properties and attempts to articulate a process&#8209;oriented approach that relates the realm of human action and institutional realm. Based on Giddens' theory a model of the interaction between human action and social capital of the firm is developed. According to this model such interaction is mediated through a firm's communities of practice, which are conceptualised as the means for realising the different types of modality between social capital and human action. Such conceptualisation of a firm's communities of practice as the means for realising the different types of modality between social capital and human action provides a fine&#8209;grained approach to study the impact of their elements, i.e., shared repertoire, mutual engagement and joint enterprise, on the structural, relational and cognitive dimensions of a firm's social capital respectively. In addition, it explicates the duality of firm's communities of practice, namely: they are both the medium and the outcome of collective human action. This model also shows the need for further research in two areas. First is the study of the constraining roles of a firm's communities of practice in creating and sharing organisational tacit knowledge. Second is the study of social capital influencing organisational members in their relation to communities of practice.

Abstract:
The search tools and information retrieval systems on the contemporary Web use keywords, lexical analysis, popularity, and statistical methods to find and prioritise relevant data to a specific query. In recent years, Semantic web has introduced new approaches to specify Web data using machine&#8209;interpretable structures. This has led to the establishment of new frameworks for search engines and information systems based on discovering complex and meaningful relationships between information resources. In this paper we discuss a semantic supported information search and retrieval system to answer users' information queries. The paper focuses on knowledge discovery aspects of the system and in particular analysis of semantic associations. The information resources are multimedia data, which could be retrieved from heterogeneous resources. The main goal is to provide a hypermedia presentation, which narratively conveys relevant information to the queried term. The structure describes the related entities to the queried topic and a ranking mechanism assigns weights to the entities. The assigned weights express the degree of relevancy of each related entity in the presentation structure.

Assessing Success Factors of Knowledge Management Initiatives of Academic Institutions â€” a Case of an Indian Business School

Authors:

Abstract:
Effective knowledge management is considered to play an increasingly important role in creating competitive advantage. Knowledge is becoming a driving force for organisational change and wealth creation. As a result, organisations are at varying stages of planning and implementing knowledge&#8209;based strategies in efforts to improve their competitiveness, productivity, organisational effectiveness and customer service. However, KM initiatives are both expensive and risky propositions. Financial resources put a ceiling on what can be expended on knowledge activities. There is a huge demand for skilled managers in the global economy, including India. This necessitates a re&#8209;look at knowledge management initiatives in business schools, which can be considered to be knowledge intensive organisations. This paper is a result of an exploratory study that tries to explain the factors influencing the success of knowledge management initiatives in a business school to distinguish itself in the academic market place. A generalised model has been constructed highlighting possible antecedents and consequences of a business school in its quest for becoming a learning organisation. This model is then applied in a reputed business school in India as a test case.

Abstract:
This paper undertakes an ontological analysis of knowledge management systems from two perspectives: Popperian and Heideggerian. Earl's taxonomy of knowledge management schools is used as the proxy for the variety of systems that can be found in practice. The paper takes two contrasting ontological systems to identify generic strengths and weaknesses at the level of the School. The argument is made that many of the issues and difficulties frequently encountered in organisations are unlikely to have managerial or technological solutions as they are ontologically implied by the very systems themselves.

Abstract:
In this article we examine the difficulties of knowledge communication among experts and decision makers. We begin by outlining where and how the communication of expertise from specialists to managers is crucial. We then review theoretical constructs that highlight knowledge transfer problems among experts and decision makers. On the basis of this review and using the results from six focus groups and thirty interviews with engineers and managers, we categorise these transfer challenges into five major groups. We distinguish among expert&#8209; and manager&#8209;caused problems, reciprocal problems, problems due to the interaction situation and problems caused by the organisational context. These categories can be used to guide research on the micro&#8209;aspects of knowledge transfer. Managers can use these problem categories to identify and reduce knowledge transfer barriers in their interaction with specialists.

Abstract:
The government's aspirations of making Malaysia a leading international educational centre in the Asian Region has put a strong pressure on local universities to improve the quality of education they offer. One of the major steps that has been identified by the government to achieve this goal is to enhance the performance of local universities through the application and implementation of an excellent knowledge management (KM) system. An effective KM system requires every academician to practice appropriate management of knowledge in his or her teaching and learning activities, which includes, generating, acquiring, storing and disseminating knowledge effectively to users of knowledge, especially students. A study by the Centre for Academic Development (CADe) of Universiti Putra Malaysia in 2005 found that the level of knowledge management practices in Malaysian universities was merely moderate; and to meet the national aspirations, KM practices need to be developed further from various aspects of structure, facilities and culture among the academic players. The objective of this study is to evaluate the level of practice among the academicians and to determine factors contributing to the effectiveness of knowledge management practices at individual, faculty and university level. Eight local universities, both public and private participated in the study. Factor Analysis was used to determine factors affecting the practices of knowledge management while Multiple Regression Analysis was used to analyse and determine the importance of various variables that will add value, thus improve the performance of Malaysian universities. The results indicate that info&#8209;structure support; infrastructure capacity; info&#8209;culture; and knowledge acquisition, generation, storage and dissemination; are important factors in shaping the KM initiatives. Info&#8209; structure is found to be the most significant variable. This is consistent with other studies, which confirm that people and cultural issues are the most difficult problems to resolve, but tend to produce the greatest benefits.

Knowledge representation schemes combine data structures, and interpretative procedures that enable the extraction of the knowledge embedded in the data structures. A broad spectrum of knowledge types need to be represented, but available representation techniques are not optimum systems since they vary in level of expressiveness and power. Knowledge demands more than the conventional representation structures used for databases and information. This is because information is derived from processing, refining and analysing raw data. The extra refinement, analysis and addition of heuristics to information converts it to knowledge. This paper discusses the major issues in the quest for an efficient knowledge representation technique and assesses the performance and level of usefulness of some of the most successful approaches in knowledge representation.

Abstract:
Call centres, or their contemporary successors contact centres, are the preferred and prevalent way for many companies to communicate with their customers, but perhaps the greatest challenge of running a call centre, is to ensure that customers are provided with the right information in a timely fashion. Knowledge management has a number of practical tools and strategies to meet this challenge but to leverage the potential of these tools organisations must understand how to implement knowledge management especially in their call centre department. This research paper focuses on five main roles of knowledge management namely; knowledge acquisition, utilisation, adaptation, dissemination and generation, while knowledge management is achieved by identifying and managing these roles efficiently in an organisation. The primary data comprises interviews with managers of the call centre department of two largest car makers in Iran. Using case study approach, this research tries to describe and illustrate how participating companies are managing their organisational knowledge in their call centres, which items are supported under their supervision and which items have not been covered.

Title:
Addressing Failure Factors in Knowledge Management
Pages:
pp334&#8209;347
Authors:
Rosina O. Weber
Abstract:
This article describes a knowledge management (KM) approach conceived from countermeasures targeted at addressing failure factors suggested in the literature. In order to counteract failure factors, the approach combines the technology of knowledge&#8209;based KM systems, with the flexibility and understanding of knowledge facilitators, and the processes of the target community. In the KM system, the approach uses knowledge engineering concepts to represent knowledge artifacts and to enforce managerial responsibilities. By imposing a strict representation format, the approach guides and helps users. It does so by determining what knowledge to contribute, by enabling knowledge collection, and by representing knowledge. The purpose of knowledge facilitators is to complement the limitations of the computer&#8209; based component by verifying the quality of submitted artifacts and by motivating members to adopt the system. The design and operation of this approach is guided by identifying the processes of the target community and the level of specificity where they are useful. The importance of this contribution is that it offers guidelines to design a KM approach that relies on conclusions from published literature. In addition, it also proposes a means to validate knowledge sharing. A conclusion of this work is that it may be easier to address failure factors of KM approaches when all members of the target community have the same technical goals, are motivated by a common interest, are organized on a flat hierarchy, and are receptive to innovation. In addition, the use of a representation of the community's processes helps standardize capture, guide contributors, and associate existing with new artifacts. This association of artifacts can be used to validate knowledge sharing.

Authors:
Gabriela Avram
Abstract:
This paper is an exploration of knowledge work practices in a distributed software development setting. The author has undertaken an empirical study in the Irish subsidiary of a multinational company over a 16&#8209;month period. Our methods were inspired by ethnography; by spending an extended period of time with a software development team working on a specific project, we had the opportunity to observe real work practices in a real work setting in the specific circumstances of distributed work. The purpose of the current study is to highlight the ways in which technical and social factors are inextricably entwined in distributed work settings.

Intellectual Capital and Organizational Performance: an Empirical Study of the Pharmaceutical Industry

Abstract:
This paper directly measures the impact of intellectual capital management on organizational performance. Although this is an area widely studied in the literature, the nature of most of the work to date is to focus on specific aspects of intellectual capital (human, structural, or relational capital) and their individual impact on performance. This study specifically looks to identify firms that manage overall IC, whatever its nature, better than competitors. We then ask the question, do these firms actually see market results better than those of competitors?  In order to do this type of analysis, we felt a need to focus on a specific industry. If wide differences do exist between industries in terms of physical capital needs and human, structural, or relational capital needs, then random firms are harder to compare. Those within a single industry, such as the pharmaceutical firms studied here, should have relatively similar structures in relation to all these needs. We collected data on 139 firms in the drugs industry. We sorted and divided the sample according to market capitalization and book value (a common measure of intellectual capital) then looked at return on assets, investment, and equity, as well as beta. By one measure, firms with the highest level of intangible assets clearly performed better than those with lower levels. The high level firms had significantly better returns and significantly less variability in stock price. According to a second measure, the results were less convincing but still lent support to further research using this methodology.  So, as a first cut, this study had very promising results. We intend to repeat it for other industries, experimenting with the measures and means of cutting the data. Although industry&#8209;specific is obviously the initial way to go, we also intend to perform some cross&#8209;industry comparisons with the measures we develop. We believe the results of the full research program will be significant to practice and will provide substantial support to those championing better management of intangible assets within firms.

From Individual Learning to Organizational Learning
Pages:
pp363&#8209;372
Authors:
Delio Ignacio Castaneda
Manuel FernÃ¡ndez Rios
Abstract:
In the last few years several theoretical models of organizational learning have been developed from the perspective of diverse disciplines. One of the most influential models is that of Crossan, Lane and White (1999), who believe that organizational learning occurs through four processes (intuiting, interpreting, integrating and institutionalizing) and in two ways: from the individual to the organization (feed forward) and from the organization to the individual (feedback). This model, however, attributes to intuiting (defined by the authors as "the preconscious recognition of the pattern andor possibilities inherent in a personal stream of experience" p. 525) the whole explanation for individual learning, ignoring the influence of conscious learning processes. Zietsma, Winn, Branzei and Vertinsky (2002) introduce two modifications to the model: the process of attending and the process of experimenting. The value of their proposal lies in the recognition of the influence of a conscious process in learning, namely attention. Attending, however, is just one of the many processes that intervene in individual learning. Castaneda and Perez (2005) make a contribution to the original model of Crossan, Lane and White (1999) by redefining individual learning from the perspective of capabilities and learning sub&#8209;processes beyond mere intuition that excludes other cognitive processes and forms of conscious learning. Humans have the capacity for symbolization, forethought, learning through modeling, self&#8209;regulation and self&#8209;reflection. Individual conscious learning includes the process of attention; yet, at the same time (according to Bandura, 1986), it includes three other processes: retention, production and motivation. This paper presents an improvement proposal at the group level of the model, adding two conscious processes: conversation and social modeling. Finally, a case is described with examples of each of the new introduced processes, at the individual and group levels.

Tacit Knowledge Elicitation and Measurement in Research Organisations: a Methodological Approach

Authors:
Alexeis Garcia-Perez
Amit Mitra
Abstract:
Contextual complexities as a result of the nature of knowledge based resources of organisations are increasingly the bases of competitive advantage. n the third generation of KM theories and techniques, intra&#8209; organisational flows of knowledge resources have become as important as the resources themselves. Management of such flows is an imperative rather than an alternative for most organisations. When attempting to implement effective KM strategies, most organisations assume complete awareness of what knowledge&#8209;based resources they own and which elements of these, need to be shared. However, such an assumption may not always be valid. While many scholars have conducted research into measurement and management of explicit knowledge, limited progress has been made in applying similar processes to tacit knowledge resources. The KM research and practice communities agree on the importance of identifying and measuring tacit knowledge&#8209;based resources, while absence of suitable instruments designed to apply to it continues to be a problem. This paper outlines a method to identify and measure organisational tacit knowledge&#8209;based resources based on the concepts of tacit knowledge stocks, their intra&#8209;organisational flows, and enablers and inhibitors of such flows. The research paper describes the method, and the process of its validation, performed within a research and development organisation.

Abstract:
This paper develops a general framework for assessment and management of competence. It then illustrates a case study demonstrating how to pragmatically assist engineers and managers to confirm their competence, knowledge and understanding against occupational standards without placing undue pressure on their time. It proposes a form of continuous assessment over a 3&#8209;6 month period using electronic evidence provided by the candidate in response to a set of focussed emailed questions to build up a paperless portfolio. It also briefly looks how the process can be extended to maintain and update competence and possible future steps to quantify the assessed competence based on weighted performance measures.

Managing Structural Diversity: the Case of Boundary Spanning Networks
Pages:
pp399&#8209;410
Authors:
Eli Hustad
Abstract:
This paper reports from an interpretive case study conducted in a multinational company that operates in the . marine insurance industry. The study focuses on how structural diversity influences knowledge work activities performed by participants who are members of distributed networks of practice (DNoPs). In this paper, a DNoP is defined as a loosely knit, geographically dispersed group of participants who share knowledge with the purpose of solving business problems and improve daily work practices within an organization. The paper takes the view that dimensions of structural diversity such as geographical dispersion, business functions and business divisions define internal organizational boundaries. Thus, knowledge sharing in structurally diverse networks may be less efficient due to the barriers that these internal boundaries may cause. Structural diversity, however, may also enhance creativity and innovation where radical new insights arise from different perspectives introduced by the participants. Consequently, diversity and its potential boundaries embed a duality of contradictory features.   The interviewees who participated in this study regarded diversity as a valuable resource. Different perceptions of business concepts, however, caused misunderstanding and conflicts between participants who worked at different business divisions and thus were geographically dispersed. Interesting findings demonstrated that the DNoPs under study went through an evolution where participants enacted through boundary spanning activities to overcome the barriers that structural diversity caused. The role of knowledge brokers and the use of boundary objects were crucial in these activities. While some boundary objects acted as obstacles, unexpected and illogical objects emerged from practice and became the most efficient boundary objects in use. Different communication media such as video&#8209; and teleconferences, email and intranet supported the boundary spanning processes. This paper brings the insight that networks were transformed by the influence of diversity, and that knowledge practices within the networks supported a shift as the networks evolved through cross&#8209;network interactions.

Folksonomies, Collaborative Filtering and e&#8209;Business: is Enterprise 2.0 One Step Forward and Two Steps Back?
Pages:
pp411&#8209;418
Authors:
Kevin Johnston
Abstract:
Enterprise2.0 is the use of emergent social software tools to improve knowledge sharing and collaboration within and between firms, their customers and partners. This paper proposes that Enterprise2.0 is a double&#8209;edged sword and should be adopted cautiously. Emerging trends in e&#8209;business are specialisation and collaboration, creating a diverse population of organisations, each tightly defined by its core competences, interacting in a constant sequence of transient relationships, each motivated by a particular market opportunity. These dynamic business networks depend on the establishment of appropriate platforms and global standards to enable smooth interaction between the service components, in particular, appropriate metadata such as ontologies. The dynamism of such an interconnected yet free&#8209; wheeling economy is constrained unless risks relating to investment in a new business relationship are reduced to levels where the risk&#8209;reward ratio favours agility rather than inertia. For its advocates, Enterprise2.0 techniques promise to contribute to the evolution of dynamic, agile, collaborative e&#8209;commerce. However, its egalitarian and permissive nature creates challenges. Folksonomies allow a more customer&#8209;centric view of an organisation's value proposition but may also undermine carefully devised official ontologies. Collaborative filtering may provide a mechanism for mitigating risk but the trust created is dependent upon the perceived credibility of the reviewers. A high profile example of an initiative designed to facilitate dynamic e&#8209;commerce which failed due to unsatisfactory classification of its members and the perceived risk of interacting with unknown reputations is examined. Recent academic research and practical applications that address these conflicts are reviewed.

A Model of Antecedents of Knowledge Sharing

pp419&#8209;426
Authors:
Radwan Alyan Kharabsheh
Abstract:
In the new era of the knowledge economy, knowledge&#8209;based work has replaced regular, sequential work with its characteristics of flexibility, complexity, and high uncertainty (Shieh&#8209;Chieh that knowledge is one of the most competitive resources for the dynamic global business environment (Sharif 2005). Within this context, an organisation's ability to effectively implement knowledge&#8209;based activities becomes increasingly vital for the development and sustenance of competitive advantage (De Carolis, 2003; Grant, 1996). Fundamentally, knowledge&#8209;based activities include the creation and integration of knowledge, the accumulation and utilisation of knowledge, and the learning and sharing of knowledge and together, these comprise knowledge management (Shieh&#8209;Chieh management (Szulanski, 1996; Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000).   Egan (2003) argued that the effective flow of knowledge is only sustainable through people. Geraint (1998) contended that too much faith has been invested in technology at the expense of people issues. Despite the fact that factors affecting the behaviour of knowledge sharing have been quite heavily investigated (Wasko and Faraj, 2000; Ardichvili al. dimensions have been conducted (Fu and Lee, 2005).  This paper looks at how organisations can become more sophisticated at supporting knowledge sharing, by identifying antecedents of knowledge sharing. The basic premise of this paper is that effective knowledge sharing has three interrelated links. The first link relates to knowledge values held by organisational members, i.e. learning orientation which describes three organisational values routinely associated with the predisposition of the firm to learn: commitment to learning, open&#8209;mindedness, and shared vision. The second link relates to market orientation which typically focuses on three components: customer focus, competitor focus and inter&#8209;functional coordination. The final link relates to the organisations' absorptive capacity which is defined as 'the ability to recognise the value of new external information, assimilate it, and apply it to commercial ends'. The paper also argues that the successful sharing of knowledge requires enablers in the form of information technology infrastructure, a reward system that reinforces and encourages knowledge sharing activities and a positive social interaction that creates trust among organisational members. The paper represents work in progress. The final version of the proposed model will be tested in technology parks in Australia and Malaysia.

A Consistent Assessment of Intellectual Capital in SMEs InCaS: Intellectual Capital Statement â€” Made in Europe
Pages:
pp427&#8209;436
Authors:
Kai Mertins

Abstract:
Globalisation and the accompanying increasing international competition put considerable pressure on European small and medium&#8209;sized enterprises (SME). The key to competitiveness increasingly appears to be the way people combine, master and commercialise their know&#8209;how. Hence it is crucial for European SMEs to utilise and manage knowledge efficiently in order to obtain a competitive advantage. While different national approaches on the management of Intellectual Capital (IC) have been developed and tested, there is no European wide standard regarding the measurement of IC. The collective research project "Intellectual Capital Statement â€” Made in Europe" aims at harmonising these scattered approaches on a scientific as well as a practical level. Based on scientific consensus a first framework has been developed providing a common ground for the measurement of IC by introducing the Intellectual Capital Statement (ICS). The ICS is an instrument to assess, develop and report an organisation's IC, to monitor critical success factors systematically, and to support strategic management decisions. As InCaS puts emphasis on a practical approach suitable for SMEs, the framework is to be understood as a starting point for phase I of the project, providing the basis for further development of the method towards practicability and harmonisation. It will be expanded to the final "European ICS guideline" and supported by the "ICS toolbox" in subsequent project phases. Main focus of this paper is the InCaS project and the accompanying European approach on measuring IC. As a first result a brief overview on the existing approaches on measuring IC is provided. Furthermore, the InCaS project as well as the ICS method is described and preliminary results are discussed.

How to Ensure the Quality and Reliability of Intellectual Capital Statements?

Abstract:
To gain competitive advantage in Europe, it is vital for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to utilise knowledge efficiently and to tap into full innovation potential. Reporting those intangible assets systematically to customers, partners, investors or creditors has become a critical success factor. Thus, managing "intellectual capital" (IC) becomes increasingly important for future&#8209;oriented organisations. Conventional balance sheets and controlling instruments are not sufficient any more, because intangible assets are not considered. The collective research project "Intellectual Capital Statement â€” Made in Europe" considers national experiences and the current state&#8209;of&#8209;the&#8209;art on measuring IC and will establish a European ICS guideline for implementing Intellectual Capital Statements (ICS). The ICS is an instrument to assess, develop and report an organisation's IC, to monitor critical success factors systematically, and to support strategic management decisions (cf. Mertins, Will 2007).For customers, investors and especially creditors, after receiving an ICS, one of the first things that usually comes into their mind is: Is this information "reliable"? To ensure a high quality level of ICS and to be accepted by, for instance, the financial market, it is important to have a neutral third party who certifies the reliability of the document. Learning from the experiences of ISO 9001 certification, assessment for the European Excellence Award and of financial audits, an ICS audit methodology has been developed. The ICS audit verifies the conformity with the European guideline respective ICS implementation process and the completeness of the ICS content. Furthermore, it will check whether the content is plausible, verifiable and representative for the company. To ensure sustainability, the auditor will get a picture of whether the ICS content is communicated and the stated actions for improvements are in progress or already realised. The main focus of this paper is to demonstrate how to ensure the quality and reliability of IC reporting and how to promote the sustainable realisation of actions by ICS audits.

Abstract:
Knowledge is an essential imperative of the company growth and development. This imperative determines the economy of aims realized by the company. The majority of small and medium enterprises (SME) are not aware of that as they do not economize on knowledge efficiently. The authors of the report found out about that while conducting research work within the framework of the Community Initiative Programme EQUAL in Poland in 2004&#8209;2006. The research was carried out in the SMEs involved in the Programme "Supporting restructured companies and their employees", the aim of which was choosing and preparing a company for restructuring. The authors recommend their own model of supporting restructured enterprises and their employees.

Abstract:
As an interdisciplinary research field emerging recently, Knowledge Management (KM) has been given many different definitions. This paper introduces two studies we carried out to provide a holistic and better understanding of KM. By applying the methodology of domain analysis to investigate leading peer&#8209;reviewed journals regarding KM, the first study explores six fundamental issues regarding KM, which are: why is KM necessary; what enables the birth of KM and triggers actions on KM; what does KM deal with; how to implement KM; how to support KM by information technology; and where has KM been applied. By building an ontology structure of research topics within the community of the Graduate School of Knowledge Science at Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), the second study examines KM within a more general disciplinary called Knowledge Science, which gives a description of how KM is related to other research topics.

Abstract:
Knowledge Management has become the most strategic resource in the new business environment. This research is based on the analysis of the strategic knowledge held within a multinational group; a leader in the design and production of a great variety of components for the automotive industry. It focuses on achieving feasibility and real applications by identifying knowledge gaps that must be overcome to perform certain activities, so as to take the right decision on its acquisition in terms of what to acquire, how to acquire it, and the associated time and costs. We use a recently developed artificial neural architecture called Cooperative Maximum&#8209;Likelihood Hebbian Learning, a tool to develop part of an Integral Global Model of Business Management, which has the potential to bring about a global improvement in the firm by adding value, flexibility and competitiveness. From this perspective, the model used in the study generalizes the hypothesis of organizational survival and competitiveness, so that the organization is able to identify, strengthen, and use key knowledge to reach pole position. Our conclusions suggest that it is possible to specify the knowledge that is held but is underused in the departments, taking into account their current levels of knowledge, their relevance and the urgency to acquire new knowledge. Moreover, an analysis of the required evolution rate of the present knowledge may be included which, among other aspects helps detect new knowledge, eliminate obsolete knowledge and validate new needs.

Abstract:
This paper describes the reference architecture to support a multi&#8209;user virtual healthcare network that enables rehabilitation and social reintegration of people with disabilities. The network, based on a virtual collaborative environment supported by the www, includes collaboration and interpersonal communication devices and data collection mechanisms that provide knowledge management for the system and effectiveness evaluation.  The Virtual Network (VN) allows the rehabilitation patients spread in geographically dispersed areas, a very frequent reality in the considered context, to access a distributed virtual platform able to offer communication and shared knowledge with doctors, nurses, therapists, social workers and other people involved in the process of rehabilitation. VN solutions allow building a virtual shared space, a context of understanding and knowledge where the "real world" knowledge affects virtual interaction and virtual interaction modifies "real world" therapies.  The main aim of the VN is to achieve a higher quality of life for the people with disabilities and, in the long term, from the economic point of view, to produce important savingsprofits and bring about feasible ways to improvingre&#8209;organizing health care services. The present paper illustrates our team's first steps in building such a network in Romania.  The first section establishes the link between the virtual reality and the medical rehabilitation as an important branch of the healthcare system. Several applications in the field are presented here.  The second section focuses on two main aspects: on the one hand, the current Romanian reality of medical rehabilitation and, on the other hand, the existing possibilities to build a VN for rehabilitation as a solution to the main problems Romania has in this field.  The third section is a technical preamble to the knowledge sharing process particularized for a healthcare VN in section number four.  The last part of the paper includes both pro and cons arguments for the designing of a VN as a solution to the discrepancy between the demand and the real current hospitals' supply of medical rehabilitation in Romania.

Abstract:
Suitable definitions of knowledge for particular organisational contexts are valuable for knowledge management (KM). This paper explains why it is valuable, how it can be done and discusses valuable results that have been created by doing it. The why is explained in a brief discussion of relevant literature. The how is described through the use of MaKE First Steps (2006a). This paper summarises the process and this constitutes the methodology of the paper. The paper then describes three diverse organisational contexts in which it has been applied: a UK Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company; a group of international postgraduate business students; and a large Chinese bank. The outputs of this work (definitions of knowledge for these organisational contexts) are presented and discussed in detail. There are significant patterns that can be discerned which give some clear suggestions about what knowledge is valuable for organisations and should be the focus of managers investment and time. This research gives us an insight into what organisations should focus on in terms of investment of energy, time and resources. Broadly, without being too proscriptive, they should focus on the skills and learning of the personnel that make the organisation they work for, special.

Title:
Knowledge Maps and Mathematical Modelling

Authors:

Abstract:
The aim of our paper is to explain a mathematical model as a special case of symbolic knowledge map. Each knowledge mapping is a visualization of knowledge for the purpose of eliciting, sharing and expanding. Tools of such visualization can be of various types. But in reality many types of so&#8209;called knowledge maps are only data flow or information flow diagrams. Our paper will define the most important features which every knowledge map must satisfy, for instance it must include chronological, hierarchical, associative, causal and evaluative relationships, it must improve the quality of knowledge etc. In our paper we will prove that a mathematical model satisfies all requirements to be called a knowledge map. Neither definition nor categorization and taxonomy of knowledge mapping are unified in the literature so the authors try to start with working on this field. Knowledge map is a visual interception of knowledge with the aim of its storage, sharing and development. Weak descriptive knowledge maps may be used for explaining the ideas and concepts connected with OR models, as well as for explaining the new knowledge gained with the models, in a well&#8209; structured form.   Strong descriptive knowledge maps can serve to describe real relations between the objects of the models or real elements in relation to their positioning. In this case the object placing does not describe only its physical position but also, for instance, its economical indexes. Like the normative OR models, the normative knowledge maps show the normative solution, or help to find the best, desirable or advisable solution. After suggestions of how to categorize knowledge maps (above) mathematical models of various types with all features and properties are presented as a knowledge map.

Exploration of Knowledge Sharing Challenges in Value Networks: a Case Study in the Finnish Grocery Industry
Pages:
pp505&#8209;514
Authors:
Hanna Timonen

Abstract:
Business activities are increasingly organized through networks. This article considers the value network of the Finnish grocery industry, a network where the web of relationships between two or more companies creates tangible and intangible value through the complex and dynamic exchanges. In value networks the relationships between the participants of the network tend to be more complex than the traditional make&#8209;buy&#8209;relationships, as companies create value together through different types of relationships such as deep buyer&#8209;supplier&#8209;relationships or strategic partnerships. This variance in the nature and level of collaborative relationships poses new challenges to knowledge sharing. Complementing previous research on the challenges to knowledge sharing in other network settings, this article explores the knowledge sharing challenges specific to value networks based on a qualitative case study about the value network of the Finnish grocery industry. The data consists of 32 thematic interviews of top and upper management representatives from 16 companies in the value network.  The results show that the current collaborative relationships in the Finnish grocery industry are functional and working, but mostly just traditional "arms&#8209;length" buyer&#8209;supplier&#8209;relationships. However, the challenges to knowledge sharing seem to be somewhat different to those present in other network settings. The challenges to knowledge sharing in value networks do not seem to concern so much the opportunities for knowledge sharing, but the motivational and cultural factors affecting what knowledge is shared and how much knowledge is shared. Based on these results, the knowledge sharing challenges of the value network can be crystallized under three points. First, the focus of knowledge sharing has been on information, and the organizational arrangements do not encourage the sharing of valuable know&#8209;how. Second, the organizational cultures and top management directives do not encourage external knowledge sharing, and therefore knowledge is not shared. And third, the experiences of past abuses of trust and the retail groups renewed focus on price bargaining undermine the trust between the companies, thus inhibiting knowledge sharing.

Does Intellectual Capital Management 'Make a Difference'? A Critical Case Study Application of Structuration Theory
Pages:
pp515&#8209;526
Authors:
John A. Tull
John C. Dumay
Abstract:
The central problem addressed in this paper is how intellectual capital (IC) management can progress beyond measurement and disclosure to provide a more dynamic interpretive scheme, in order to meet strategic management's demand that IC should 'make a difference'.   Via a longitudinal case study, we observe an evolving use of narrative in disclosing IC and the manner and impacts of that change, set in the real example of a sophisticated organisation's struggle to realise the potential value of managing IC amidst rapid business change and intense competition. In order to frame the discussion, elements of Giddens' 'structuration theory' are critically applied to understand the recursiveness of the change that occurred from within the organisation.   We report three main findings. First, organisation's operating environment, as reflected in changes to the framework adopted for managing IC despite continuing frustration in realising the envisaged benefits. Second, we establish the use of structuration theory as a tool to analyse the manner and impact of IC practices in future research. Third, we show how the stated aims of IC practice have not yet been fully realised by the studied organisation, thus providing a realistic example of the possible failings of IC practice due to inadequacies of the modalities employed by management to bring about recursive change and the need for a fuller assessment of projective agency.

Integrating Individual and Organisational Learning Initiatives: Working Across Knowledge Management and Human Resource Management Functional Boundaries
Pages:
pp527&#8209;538
Authors:
Christine van Winkelen

Abstract:
Knowledge management initiatives enable an organisation to learn from its successes and mistakes. The nature of knowledge and learning processes means that in seeking to improve the way the organisation learns, knowledge management also has to pay attention to the learning of individuals. In most organisations, other functional specialists also have responsibility for individual learning. This exploratory qualitative research has examined the ways that planned learning initiatives generated by knowledge management and human resources management functions can be integrated more effectively.  A survey of the planned individual and organisational learning activities and processes in ten large organisations was undertaken. Eleven examples of initiatives that integrate individual and organisational learning were also identified from within these organisations. These were evaluated and the issues associated with implementation explored through an expert panel and interview process with knowledge managers and human resource managers.   Factors that positively influence integration were found to include widespread recognition of the business value of both individual and organisational learning, high level sponsorship that acts as a bridge across functional boundaries and line managers adopting an integrating approach to learning in managing their people and the tasks they undertake. Factors that negatively impact the adoption of an integrated approach were found to include the lack of mechanisms to coordinate across functions and a culture in which functional managers feel unable to change practices.   This research has generated a model that appears to be useful in organising the analysis of the planned learning initiatives that are being undertaken by different functions. Together with the examples of integration and its enablers and barriers, knowledge managers and human resource managers can use this to proactively move forward with a more "joined up" approach to learning.

Intangible Assets: Importance in the Knowledge&#8209;Based Economy and the Role in Value Creation of a Company
Pages:
pp539&#8209;550
Authors:
Dmitry Volkov
Tatiana Garanina
Abstract:
The paper is devoted to the question of how important Intangible Assets (IA) are in today's knowledge&#8209;based economy. The latest surveys show that the value of companies is now mostly generated by Intangible Assets, and not by "traditional" assets having a tangible form. The main research objective is to define the impact of fundamental value of both tangible and intangible assets on the market value of assets of Russian companies. As a general approach used herein for IA evaluation, the method of calculated intangible value offered by T. Stewart was chosen. Developed econometric models are tested on the data of Russian stock market from 2001 to 2005 year. In the focus of the research there is both the analysis of the sampled companies (43 companies) as a whole as well as divided into five aggregated fields: mechanical engineering, extractive industry, engineering, communication services, and metallurgy. Some suggestions for managing IA in Russian companies are presented in the paper. In conclusion, the main directions for further research in this field are outlined.

Peer&#8209;to&#8209;Peer Systems Consubstantiating the Ba Concept
Pages:
pp1&#8209;12
Authors:
FÃ¡bio LuÃ­s Accorsi
JoÃ£o Paulo Costa
Abstract:
The conceptual evolution of Knowledge Management (KM) has been supported by the use of flexible processes and several computational tools. The sophistication of these tools, incorporating the KM concepts, has been growing with time, creating functions better suited to knowledge creation processes. However, centralized Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) present some inconveniences, such as inflexible knowledge codification structures and centralised control. These may diminish the flexibility and the availability of knowledge through processes that standardize knowledge and information and remove them from the context. The suggestion of peer&#8209;to&#8209;peer (P2P) systems seems to promise to overcome these inconveniences by supporting interaction and knowledge sharing in simultaneous different contexts. The P2P systems provide real benefits to the interchange of knowledge among its peerscollaborators, but they are far from being a guarantee of interaction. We argue that the notion of ba is the design basis to obtain P2P systems closer to theoretical KM concepts. Peers can be encouraged to freely share knowledge without the constraints imposed by hierarchies or other organisational limitations. Interaction through P2P systems, supported by the ba concept, can make better use of autonomy to access and share personal knowledge without a centralized codification. P2P systems consubstantiate the ba concept thereby creating a new entity which we call "connecting ba". We believe that the "connecting ba" can give different visions and energy to the utilization of P2P systems. "Connecting ba" can also provide stimulation for virtual participation and for knowledge creation processes. Probably the most important implication of "connecting ba" is the possibility to incorporate peers within the spirit of ba, promoting collaboration for knowledge creation. The characteristics and the concept relations of these notions are enumerated and justified throughout the text.

Demosthenes Akoumianakis
Abstract:
This paper considers knowledge management functions as carried out by distributed virtual teams involved in the compilation of information&#8209;based products using dedicated and domain&#8209;specific computer&#8209; mediated practices and tools. We are concerned with two primary tasks, namely depositing shared assets and assembling information&#8209;based artefacts by appropriating the benefits of virtual networking. Moreover, these tasks are considered from the perspective of the Social Experience Factory (SEF) â€” a platform enabling rich collaborative interactions between geographically dispersed members of communities of practice. The SEF incorporates domain&#8209;specific workflows and several model&#8209;based tools to facilitate systematic accumulation and reuse of collaborative artefacts. An account of these is provided by discussing current implementation in the context of a pilot application.

Abstract:
This study demonstrates that resource&#8209;based view (RBV) misidentifies the locus of dynamic knowledge articulation and long&#8209;term dynamic competitive capabilities, and focuses on the distinctive role of drivers of dynamic learning mechanism in the evolution of dynamic knowledge articulation and dynamic competitiveness. Five drivers of dynamic learning mechanism such as the integration power of managers, external linkages, previous experience, repeated practice, and codification of experience play important roles on developing dynamic knowledge articulation, and ambiguity is a negative driver impact on developing dynamic knowledge articulation. Dynamic knowledge articulation is a positive impact on dynamic competitiveness in alliance organizations. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to a more complete understanding on developing dynamic knowledge articulation via the dynamic learning mechanism. The paper defines a clear theoretical model for the tautological animadversion of past research on RBV that can be complemented.

Value Creation in Russian Companies: the Role of Intangible Assets
Pages:

Authors:

Tatiana Garanina
Abstract:
In today's changing economy managers of the leading companies understand that the key sources for value creation are Intangible Assets (IA). The latest surveys confirm the fact that nowadays these assets are the value drivers and not "traditional" assets having tangible form. The same surveys confirm the fact, that one third of all the effected investment solutions is based on the existing Intangible Assets, and that the decisions made on the basis of IA allow them to make a more accurate prediction of income and profitability of a company in the future, and, hence, the company's value for the shareholders. The research held in the paper defines the impact of fundamental value of both tangible and intangible assets on the market value of assets of Russian companies. As a general approach used herein for IA evaluation, the method of Calculated Intangible Value (CIV) offered by T. Stewart was chosen. According to CIV the evaluation of Intangible Assets is based on residual operating income (REOI) model as a variant fundamental value of equity model. The problem of Intangible Assets composition and structure is also covered in the paper. Developed econometric models are tested on the data of Russian stock market for two periods: from 2001 to 2005 year and from 2001 to 2006. In the focus of the research there is both the analysis of the sampled companies (43 companies) as a whole as well as divided into five aggregated fields: mechanical engineering, extractive industry, power engineering, communication services, and metallurgy. At the end of the paper the authors highlight the main directions for further research in the field.

Abstract:
This paper hopes to persuade readers of current thinking around Knowledge Management that more emphasis should be placed on tacit knowledge in management and its education and how it might be better communicated to students within universities and in organisations in general. It reflects upon what appears to be the predominant attention being paid to explicit knowledge in the curriculum and pedagogy of UK Universities which offer courses entitled Knowledge Management, and that this may be at the expense of more tacit knowledge 'management' approaches.

Abstract:
Organizations today should actively incorporate knowledge strategy (KS) into their Business Strategy (BS) as knowledge has been recognized as a strategic element in the performance of the organization. Hence, the current research hypothesis that the alignment between BS and KS has a positive effect on the organizational performance.   In an attempt to explore the alignment between KS and BS, an operational model is proposed based on the prior studies in the strategic alignment. BS types were viewed in terms of Miles and Snow's (1978) typology of Defenders, Analyzers and Prospectors. Two KS strategies include: Aggressive Knowledge Strategy (AKS) and Conservative Knowledge Strategy (CKS) were selected to examine the KM strategic alignment with business strategies. This model was empirically validated through a survey of 106 banks selected from the six Gulf countries (Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, and Oman). With respect to the perspective of alignment, the moderation approach was chosen. The overall finding of the research demonstrated that there is a strong association between KS and BS and that the alignment between KS and BS clearly influenced the organizational performance.

Knowledge Management and Higher Education: A UK Case Study

Abstract:
This paper presents the initial findings of a case study conducted at seven Higher Education Institutions within the United Kingdom. The Case Study utilizes Stankosky's Knowledge Management (KM) pillars to enterprise learning â€” leadership, organization, technology and learning â€” as a lens to investigate and understand Knowledge Management practices and perceptions within Higher Education Institutions, looking at challenges of implementation within this sector. Higher Education Institutions within the United Kingdom are very complex institutions, with diverse backgrounds, history, culture, resources and missions. The University presents itself in today's knowledge economy with a dichotomy of priorities, one which aims to provide quality teaching and research activity, and the other, to ensure effective and efficient management and administration within an increasingly competitive market. Being a service, non&#8209;profit organization ensures that the values of scholarship remain a very important aspect of its mission; yet, the external environment within which HEIs conduct their business today is rapidly changing, forcing HEIs to reflect on how they do 'business' given the external pressures they face. This case study uses the Grounded Theory methodology to begin to unpack the issues related to the implementation of Knowledge Management within this context. It focuses on two aspects of the case study â€” the characteristics of universities and academics that hinder or promote the implementation of KM, and the perceptions of Knowledge Management and its challenges for implementation within the HEI sector. Initial findings are presented.

Abstract:
Organisations are increasingly turning their attention to the creation and use of knowledge as a strategic resource. Too often however, knowledge management initiatives fail to deliver the competitive advantage expected from a strategic resource. The knowledge management literature is characterised by frameworks for knowledge management implementation which tend to prescribe best&#8209;practice methods to a large range of companies. Although useful, a key weakness of these frameworks is their inability to account for contextual differences. Consequently many organisations attempt to apply a knowledge management framework that simply doesn't fit the organisational context resulting in little or no benefit from their efforts. A shift in focus from best practice to best fit is necessary to account for the difference in organisational contexts.  Systems thinking emphasises context as an important element in understanding a system, and five concepts from systems theory are used to define the criteria for establishing a best&#8209;fit approach. A social constructionist approach to the research further affords the opportunity to identify areas of significant variation in knowledge management context and practices within knowledge&#8209;centric organisations. A multi&#8209;method research strategy, comprising cluster analysis and case study research, is proposed to develop insight into the emergence of different configurations of knowledge management capabilities within different organisational contexts.  The proposed conceptual framework forms the foundation for building a typology of knowledge&#8209;centric organisations which will enable organisations to choose the most appropriate approach to knowledge management based on their specific context which varies along the dimensions of their knowledge&#8209;orientation, knowledge management intent and knowledge management enactment.

Information Anxiety: Fact, Fable or Fallacy

Authors:

Abstract:
The aim of this paper is to compare and contrast the findings of three recent empirical studies that examined the construct of information anxiety. The concept of anxiety created from information has been studied for hundreds of years; however, this paper views this complex relationship based on the foundation provided by Richard Wurman's book Information Anxiety (1989). The three studies explored the five subcomponents of information anxiety as described by Wurman: not understanding information; feeling overwhelmed by the amount of information to be understood; not knowing if certain information exists; not knowing where to find information; and knowing exactly where to find the information, but not having the key to access it. In order to gauge the level of information anxiety a survey instrument was designed using eight management scenarios suggested by Davenport and Prusak in Working Knowledge (1998). Four of the eight scenarios examine the creation of information from data and four scenarios focus on the transformation of information into knowledge. Of specific interest to these studies was the question is there a difference between information overload and information anxiety. In other words, is the issue simply one of quantity or do other information related challenges make a difference. To this end, the researchers sought to determine if respondents perceived a difference between information overload and the other components of information anxiety. The first of these studies determined that respondents reported a statistically significant difference between information overload and several other components while the second study's respondents did not report such a difference. The conflicting results begged the question: is information anxiety a fact, fiction, or fallacy? The third study reinforced the finding of the initial study suggesting information anxiety is a real organizational malady worthy of the attention of senior leaders. Clearly additional research is required to further refine the malady, its causes, and ways to combat its debilitating effects.

Abstract:
This paper presents a hybrid approach to understanding the knowledge management requirements for a knowledge intensive service organization. It proposes a strategy&#8209;knowledge management alignment framework grounded in literature. The framework was constructed by studying four published case&#8209;studies that tackle knowledge management at world class management consulting firms. The paper then applies the framework to two cases in the knowledge intensive services sector. The first case studies a young management consulting firm needing to formalize its knowledge management policies and processes. The second case studies the creation of an IT Outsourcing Services Division by a traditional telecommunications company that needs to expand its product offering to increase its opportunities for growth in a small market.   The two case studies support the proposed framework and show that it can be used to obtain practical solutions in a business environment. One of the case studies also contributes to developing the case method in research by using the Socratic Dialogue as a means to collecting and analyzing evidence.

Reconsidering KnowledgeÂƒ And Business Improvement

Abstract:
The ever growing complexity of market processes continues to increase the importance of knowledge as the organization's core capability to maximize business performance. Current conceptions of knowledge and knowledge representation, however, prove to be highly unproductive. A fundamental problem here is that insight into the nature of knowledge is an inevitable requirement for adequate knowledge management that, nevertheless, is hardly met in business. In this article, we claim that adopting a functional view of the nature of knowledge reveals and restores the relation between knowledge and corporate effectiveness.  In a functional approach to conceptualization, functional equivalence instead of observable similarity serves as the basis for classification. The sets of conditions that have to be met in a particular situation are here taken as functional demands. These functional demands may vary across situations, thus precluding the valid possibility of a static one&#8209;on&#8209; one connection between functions and individual objects. Not the objects as potential instances of classes, but the relationships between objects given their properties and situations, defined in terms of functional demands, become central. These relationships define the concepts, and thus what we know. Classification amounts to relational matching of specified situations to specified objects.   The functional view not only enables content improvement through rational classifications, but also enhances process designs, implementations and process maintenance. It also aligns information technology to the new demands set by the knowledge economy by enabling goal&#8209;oriented, transparent and easy&#8209;to&#8209;use&#8209;and&#8209;modify knowledge structures. The paper further describes a real world case taken from the financial services industry to exemplify how a functional analysis of knowledge &#8209;including to the functional view aligned MatchÂ’ Technology&#8209; realizes great improvements in business performance.

Title:
On Measuring Organizational Relationships: Threats to Validity in the Use of Key&#8209;Informants
Pages:
pp71&#8209;82
Authors:
Haris Papoutsakis
Abstract:
The measurement of organizational characteristics in empirical studies that focus on inter&#8209;group, knowledge&#8209; based collaboration requires research methods different from those used for measuring the characteristics of individuals. As an answer to that, key&#8209;informant methodology is a frequently adopted approach that has been associated with qualitative methods. However, recently organizational researchers have used the technique to obtain quantifiable information on organizational structure, internal power distribution, within the group, and external relationships among groups that base their collaboration on the knowledge they share.  This paper focuses on the threats to validity, which are inherent in empirical studies that adopt the key&#8209;informant methodology as a social science tool. In particular, the paper thoroughly examines the effects that the Bagozzi and the Cook and Campbell construct validity criteria as well as the Huber and Power key&#8209;informant validity criteria have during the two important phases of a research, i.e. developing valid measures of the theoretical constructs, and testing the relationships between theoretical constructs. The empirical results used in this paper stem from an investigation that aimed to evaluate the contribution of Shared Knowledge and Information Technology to Manufacturing Performance. Mutual Trust and Mutual Influence, among the collaborating groups (in this case manufacturing, quality and R&D), which were used in our study, as the two antecedents of shared knowledge. For the purpose of this research, an evaluation model was developed and survey data was collected from 51 medium to large size industrial companies with a total of 112 manufacturing groups, representing five industrial sectors (alimentation, automotive, chemical and pharmaceutical, electro&#8209;mechanical, and textile), were analyzed to test the model.   The key&#8209;informant methodology that has been used for the selection of research responders was tested against threats to validity. As a conclusion, the paper exhibits the implications of the above widely accepted construct validity criteria and specific key&#8209;informant validity criteria, building upon the results of the above industrial empirical research. The lessons learned are presented in a way that may lead future organizational researchers to error preventive measures.

Title:
Mapping Social Networks among Crystallographers in South Africa
Pages:
pp83&#8209;92
Authors:
Gretchen Smith
Abstract:
The author adopts the premise that technological innovation, a critical factor in the long&#8209;term economic growth of any country, can only function successfully within a social environment that provides relevant knowledge and information inputs into the innovative process. This is dependent on the efficient transfer and communication of knowledge and information which in turn relates to the amount and quality of interaction among scientists and technologists. These factors prompted a research project that used social network analysis techniques to investigate knowledge exchange and to map the knowledge network structure and communication practices of a group of scientists engaged with crystallographic research. This paper is based on this research project.   The findings provide clear evidence of a strong social network structure among crystallographers in South Africa. A core nucleus of prominent, well connected and interrelated crystallographers constituted the central network of scientists that provided the main impetus to keep the network active. This eminent group of crystallographers were not only approached far more frequently for information and advice than any of their colleagues, but they also frequently initiated interpersonal and formal information communication acts. It was clear that this core group had achieved a standard of excellence in their work, were highly productive; very visible in their professional community and they generally played a pivotal role in the social network. They generally maintained a high professional profile in the crystallography community and within the general field of science, published profusely, and generally emerged as the archetypal sociometric stars in their field. It is thus clear that high productivity, professional involvement, innovation capacity and network connectivity are intricately interwoven.  The crystallographers' work environment and concomitant work structure clearly affected network interaction. Working in a group structure stimulated network interaction, professional activity and productivity. A further benefit was that the leaders of these groups generally assumed gatekeeper roles that facilitated networking and ensured the importation and interpretation of new information and knowledge. It was clear that social networks operate more effectively in areas, such as Gauteng, where a sufficient number of scientists were amassed.

Title:
Knowledge Management Practices and Challenges in International Networked NGOs: The Case of One World International
Pages:
pp93&#8209;102
Authors:
J Gretchen Smith
Patricia Mweene Lumba
Abstract:
This paper is based on the outcomes of a study that explored the knowledge management practices and challenges in an international NGO network. The investigation constituted comparative case studies of two centres (one in Zambia and the other in the Netherlands) belonging to a single international network. An empirically grounded framework of knowledge management practices based on the taxonomy proposed by Holsapple and Joshi was utilised as the reference framework for the study. The framework provided guidelines to characterize factors that influence organizational knowledge management; knowledge manipulation activities (processes) and organizational knowledge resources. The results of the empirical study confirm that a variety of factors affect knowledge management behaviours in an organization. These factors include managerial and internal controls such as management styles and incentives for knowledge creation and sharing; resource influences; and environmental influences relating to an organization's culture and the needs of partner organizations. The study highlights important variation in diversity, gaps and perceptions in managing knowledge between centres in the network that are based in Europe and Africa. This is despite significant communality in knowledge management processes and infrastructures. The results further show that institutionalization of knowledge management practices within a network seem to enable or constrain knowledge management at centre and network level. Recommendations are proposed to improve knowledge management practices at local and international level and include enhanced technical and advisory services at international level; capacity building; creating greater awareness of knowledge management; decentralization of knowledge management processes; implementation of a knowledge management strategy at network level and improving relationships between centres.   The authors conclude that networked NGO's and specifically OWI could operate more efficiently and incrementally enhance service provision by leveraging their knowledge resources more effectively. It is in this light that knowledge management practices should be examined in NGOs and particularly networks with their complex structures and attendant reoccurring and unavoidable problems.

Title:
The Emergence and Diffusion of the Concept of Knowledge Work

Abstract:
The past decades have witnessed the proliferation of research on knowledge work. Knowledge work has mostly been used as an antonym to manual work, to refer to specific occupations characterized by an emphasis on specialized skills and the use of theoretical knowledge. The efforts to encompass all the different contexts where knowledge plays a relevant role in work tasks has resulted in various and ambiguous definitions of what knowledge work actually is. In order to shed light on the elusive concept of knowledge work, we studied how it has appeared in the scientific discussion, and diffused from one scientific community to another. As the circulation of new ideas and concepts in scientific discussion is apparent through academic literature, we examined the emergence and diffusion of the concept of knowledge work through a citation analysis on articles from the Social Sciences Citation Index. The data set consists of 273 articles with 7,057 cited references for the 1974 to 2003 period, and we used a dense sub&#8209;network grouping algorithm on the co&#8209;citation network to distinguish highly cited groups of references. We distinguish three periods of diffusion of the concept of knowledge work. The results show that Drucker's In the age of discontinuity (1969) and Bell's The coming of post&#8209;industrial society (1968) were the main influencers when the concept emerged in the scientific discussion from 1974 to 1992. After this period, we can distinguish a slow diffusion period from 1993 to 2003, when the concept started to gain attention, and a fast diffusion period from 1999 to 2003, when the research proliferated. The discussion dispersed outside the management domain already in the emergence period, but the management domain has stayed the main domain of discussion also later on. However, from 1992 to 2003 the discussion inside the management domain dispersed into different groups. One of the main influences to a new group of research that appeared at this time was Zuboff's In the age of the smart machine (1984). This group, drawing on research conducted on knowledge&#8209;intensive firms, has recently produced highly cited articles such as Blackler's 'Knowledge, knowledge work and organizations' in Organization Studies (1995). As the current discussion on knowledge work is dispersed in different groups, there is a need to engage in a common conceptual discussion and define what is actually meant by knowledge work.

Knowledge Management Paradoxes
Pages:
pp1&#8209;10
Authors:
Jan Aidemark
Abstract:
Knowledge management, as an academic area, is maturing; however, there are still problems connected with both the diversity of the theoretical base and the gap between theory and its practical application. In this paper we tackle these problems by reviewing a number of basic knowledge management theories with the intention of formulating a more integrated and at the same time practical planning framework. The focus guiding the literature selection is on basic theories about the nature of knowledge management, theories that expose the complex nature of knowledge in organizations. We examine these theories and try to understand what could be perceived as the paradoxical nature of these theories. Here we understand a paradox as something seemingly self&#8209;contradictory though perhaps actually well&#8209; founded statement. We focus on four areas or themes: 1) knowledge as the key resource of a business, 2) knowledge as a competitive force and source of growth, 3) the nature of the management of a knowledge resource, and 4) the management of knowledge workers. From a practical point of view, the conflicting arguments of these theories can be seen as possible strategic options. Based on these discussions we then formulate a framework, or what might be called a strategic option generator. As a concluding discussion we focus on the contribution of ISIT to the realization of the different possible strategic options. This is done on a rather general level, where we examine the possibilities of ISIT in relation to the paradoxes.

Firms as Connected, Temporary Coalitions: Organisational Forms and the Exploitation of Intellectual Capital
Pages:
pp11&#8209;20
Authors:

Abstract:
The paper presents the case for conceptualising firms as 'connected temporary coalitions' that are able to respond to the challenges of and adapt to, changing environments: in particular, to build, exploit and determine the value of Intellectual Capital (human, structural and relational) enabling different trajectories of renewal and growth in the long term. The paper adopts the perspectives of theoretical pluralism to identify distinctive viewpoints regarding the theory of the firm and the dynamic nature of knowledge. The study draws on four areas of theory: (a) the institutionalist ideas of New Regionalism in economic geography â€” in particular the conceptualisation of firms as temporary, dynamic, place&#8209; based coalitions; (b) the structural contingency model of organisation theory coupled with ideas from the knowledge based theory of the firm in exploring changes over time in business activity; (c) evolutionary economics and the perspective it offers on emergent developments, change and time; and (d) knowledge management thinking, and the perspective it provides on intellectual capital and its contribution to firm dynamics, drawing on ideas on social interaction, social practices, social contexts, and the impacts of power and control.   The paper extends our understanding of the processes and dynamics operating in and around temporary coalitions, the shifting and reconfiguring of knowledge assets and the role of dynamic capabilities. In addition, the paper challenges earlier concepts of intellectual capital as being embedded in business clusters. The paper argues that, collectively, the coalitions of people that comprise firms deploy their knowledge assets through different forms of organisational arrangement to achieve temporary equilibrium in order to commercialise knowledge, achieve renewal and generate growth. This perspective on the firm has significant policy implications.

Intellectual Capital and IFRS3: A New Disclosure Opportunity
Pages:
pp21&#8209;30
Authors:
Daniel BrÃ¤nnstrÃ¶m
Marco Giuliani
Abstract:
As a response to the absence of an exhaustive generally accepted accounting principle handling the issue of intangibles, academics and practitioners have developed a plethora of models, methods and tools for identifying, measuring and valuing intangibles. Conscious of this situation, some authors have started asking for empirical studies of how these models make the IC issue clearer to stakeholders in general and specifically to the capital market (Guthrie, et al., 2001; Marr and Chatzkel, 2004).  The introduction of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 3 (a regulation demanding the identification and valuation of intangible assets in business combinations) may be considered as the opportunity for a practical application of the methods and tools proposed by the Intellectual Capital (IC) community, i.e. to make intangible assets such as customer capital, know how, etc. visible in the financial statement. IFRS3 is a possibility to disentangle the "black&#8209;box" of goodwill and for the financial accounting issue to adhere to some of the critique emanating from the IC debate. As a result, IFRS3 can be seen as an opportunity to test the relevance of the IC models and to reduce the gap between IC Accounting and Financial Accounting (Petty and Guthrie, 2000; Roslender and Fincham, 2001). Drawing on the debate of how to frame intangibles (Chaminade and CatasÃºs, 2007), the aim of the paper is to analyze the distance, from an empirical perspective, between IC accounting and financial accounting in order to understand if a gap exists. Thus we will investigate how firms have applied IFRS3 by studying what the relevance of intangibles is, which intangible assets have been identified and valued and what goodwill is disclosed as in the purchase analyses. The empirical corpus consists of financial statements of Swedish and Italian listed firms.  The methodology adopted is based on an empirical analysis of the purchase analyses supplied by the firms in the financial statements, referring to the first year mandatory adoption of IFRS3 (fiscal year 2006). The disclosed information is analyzed through both quantitative and qualitative analyses.  The study finds that the analytical methods are still at a very first stage and consequently there is the trend to appreciate, at least in the financial statement, the majority of the IC as goodwill. The second finding is that even if they represent the minority part of the invisible value of the company, IFRS3 has really allowed for several intangible assets usually not disclosed in the financial statements such as customer relationships, contract portfolio, etc to be made visible. A third finding is the lack of explanations for this amount of goodwill. All in all, the paper highlights that, from an empirical perspective, both financial and IC accounting models are not able to adequately grasp IC "at work".

Business Benefits of Non&#8209;Managed Knowledge
Pages:
pp31&#8209;40
Authors:
Sinead Devane
Julian Wilson
Abstract:
This paper proposes that knowledge cannot be effectively managed, rather that people are so complex and the knowledge they acquire so varied and, even in a room where everyone is being taught the same knowledge, uptake is so disparate that to truly manage what an individual knows is impossible. An effective alternative which allows people to maximise their knowledge (even the bits we might not know they know) is to measure the outputs of an individual: what they achieve. The case study in this paper illustrates one innovative company's design to maximise the knowledge of their employees and how the management&#8209;less structure they recently adopted has had a profound effect on the engagement of their workforce â€” in their work and on their profitability.   The argument will critique the theory of knowledge transfer as the movement of a body of knowledge from one place to another. Additionally it confronts the misuse of the work of Polanyi where theorists have crudely bunched together notions of understanding and the hidden aspects of our knowledge under the title 'tacit' knowledge and juxtaposed these with 'explicit' knowledge, which refers to documented and shared knowledge within an organisation. This paper promotes an approach that follows Coverdale's (psychologist) idea that getting things done by developing skills as opposed to focusing on traditional knowledge management is the premise of the company's success. The anthropological notion of cultural memes is explored, and the idea of agency will be introduced as a useful concept in acknowledging the potential of individuals to unleash their knowledge.  The case study presented here is from empirical ethnographic research within a company in the South West. The company has transitioned from a traditionally managed SME with a hierarchical structure, to a de&#8209;centred model for workplace where each individual within the company is responsible for what is essentially like their own mini company within the larger one. The company data (quantitative) from before these changes were introduced compared to the data now (on aspects such as Quality, Delivery and Profitability) tell a remarkable story about the effects of management and organisational structure on individual performance and commercial profitability. It would seem that the best results commercially and in individual competency so far point to a counter&#8209;intuitive, hands&#8209;off approach to KM within an organisation. They point to what is in fact the non&#8209;management of knowledge in the sense that knowledge will not be prescribed or transferred from one person to another, but rather drawn out of the individual.

Predicting the Influence of Network Structure on Trust in Knowledge Communities: Addressing the Interconnectedness of Four Network Principles and Trust
Pages:
pp41&#8209;54
Authors:
M. Max Evans
Anthony K.P. Wensley
Abstract:
The goal of this paper is to explore the emergence of trusting relationships within Communities of Practice. It has been argued that trust can be viewed as an organizing principle (McEvily, Perrone, and Zaheer, 2003). However, the focus of this paper is on the view that trust is an essential pre&#8209;condition for the sharing of knowledge. The goal of the paper is to discuss possible connections between social networking principles, network structure, and trust within Communities of Practice. This paper will define and subsequently analyze the concept of trust and develop arguments relating to the existence and strength of trusting relationships within Communities of Practice. The theoretical arguments propose relationships between the characteristics of trusting relationships and four network characteristics: homophily; closure; brokerage; and the small&#8209;world problem. The general research question that underpins this paper is: To what extent do network principles determine the level of trust among members within a social network (i.e. a Community of Practice)? The analysis focuses on a specific type of social network which has been termed a Community of Practice. Communities of Practice have been argued to be critical elements in the creation, refinement and sharing of knowledge (Dugid, 2005; Wenger, 1998; Wenger, McDermott, and Snyder, 2002).

Collaborative Development of Knowledge Representations â€” a Novel Approach to Knowledge Elicitation and Transfer
Pages:
pp55&#8209;62
Authors:
Alexeis Garcia-Perez
Robert Ayres
Abstract:
Knowledge Management (KM) initiatives are driven by the need to preserve and share knowledge, in particular tacit knowledge that experts have built up in the course of doing their jobs. Such initiatives require key experts to be identified and their knowledge elicited. However, knowledge elicitation generally runs into a number of communication and motivational problems. These are well known in domains such as expert systems but it is only more recently that KM practitioners have become aware of them. Standard KM approaches separate the elicitation and, possibly, encoding of knowledge from its subsequent sharing.  This paper outlines an approach where elicitation and transfer, and possibly also creation, are carried out in one process. This involves identifying key experts and stakeholders. These two groups then work together to develop a representation of the experts' domain knowledge. The role of the KM specialist thus becomes one of facilitation rather than elicitation.  This approach has a number of advantages. It is more likely to engage the interest of experts and so avoid some of the motivational problems that are commonly encountered in knowledge elicitation. It does not rely on knowledge management specialists who do not share the experts' language, to capture and record their expertise. In particular the approach helps overcome the perceptual biases of domain experts. It is well known that perception is often selective and that judgements can be anchored on false premises. Experts are not immune from these biases but they are more likely to be eliminated as a result of the critical dialogue that occurs between experts and stakeholders using our approach.  Our approach has been developed in the course of an action research project with a major engineering company. Staff who worked on a help desk had particular expertise which was of interest to other departments, such as design and production. The research data gathered was necessarily qualitative since the focus of concern was on the richness of transfer achieved. Early results suggest that communication or motivation problems encountered by conventional approaches are avoided and that a richer transfer of knowledge results. In particular it helps to identify and capture relevant tacit knowledge. The resulting representation may also form the starting point for a knowledge base which will be available to a wider community.

The Gatekeepers' Intervention in Innovation and Technological Transfer

Authors:
Deogratias Harorimana
Abstract:
This work discusses how knowledge gatekeepers' intervention in the process of innovations and technology transfer was developed and applied in the manufacturing, financial and R&D firms in Rwanda and Uganda. The study was based on 150 questionnaires distributed, and used to collect empirical data. Furthermore, 25 interviews were conducted within ten organizations and fifteen well known opinion leaders and recognised experts in the fields concerned by this study. In an examination of the role of gatekeeper of knowledge in knowledge transfer processes the study has found that knowledge gatekeepers maybe individual, a firm, or a department within an organization. Furthermore, individuals working as knowledge gatekeepers must adapt to the recipient culture and knowledge sharing practice if they are to effect change. For technological innovations and knowledge transfer, the study found that the role of gatekeepers can be a multidimensional one, ranging from being trust and relationship builders, ambassadors within and from originating firms to receiving firms, and flag bearers. On the basis of the evidences obtained, the study has found no evidence to suggest that, in a gatekeeper's intervention within the knowledge creation process, there are no evidences that, in case of a firm acting as a knowledge gatekeeper, may necessarily develop asymmetries as well as put in place destructive mechanisms to restrain potential competitors within the sector from developing similar products or that they would necessarily incorporate innovative SMEs in their network who may provide related products to the leading firm.

How to Improve Your Knowledge Intensive Organisation: Implementing a Knowledge Management Scan Within Public and Private Sector Organisations

Abstract:
The Centre of Research in Knowledge Organisations and Knowledge Management of Zuyd University has developed a knowledge management scan  The scan initiates from two models. The first model is based on the Value Based Knowledge Management approach (Tissen, Andriessen & Lekanne Deprez, 1998) and includes 6 basic abilities of a knowledge&#8209;intensive organisation that will enable the organisation to operate successfully in a knowledge based economy (.The second model, developed by Wierdsma and Swieringa (2002), categorises organisations according to their level of learning that is to say, how it develops a specific learning ability. Both models are briefly reviewed within this paper. This knowledge management scan is a tool that enables an organisation to assess the development of its six basic abilities. Once the organisation has a clear insight into its own abilities, it will be able to strengthen its overall learning ability and improve the organisations' competitive position.  Additionally we take a close look at our research approach for developing and implementing the knowledge management scan. The scan encompasses 15 statements per ability (90 statements in total). The complete scan will be assessed on a five&#8209;point scale by a representative group of selected employees and managers of an organization, supervised by a researcherconsultant.   During the analysis of the results and the presentation of recommendations, specific attention is paid to those statements that achieve high and low scores respectively (invitation to implement improvement actions) and statements that have a relatively high spread across a broad range (differences of opinion or the statement is open to different interpretations). In particular we have examined how the knowledge management scan was put into practice in one of the departments of Zuyd University. After a short summary of the organisation's initial situation, we discuss subsequent steps taken during the assessment, analysis and the advisory process. This paragraph is followed by a concise summary of the results generated by the scan. Finally we offer the recommendations and subsequent steps to be taken to implement these advices in the near future.

Model to Support Patent Retrieval in the Context of Innovation&#8209;Processes by Means of Dialogue and Information Visualisation

Abstract:
Innovations are an essential factor of competition for manufacturing companies in technical industries. Patent information plays an important role within innovation&#8209;processes and for human innovators working on innovations.   Innovation&#8209;processes support the combination of cross&#8209;organisational spread information and resources from patent databases and digital libraries is necessary in order to gain profit for innovation experts. The central challenge is to overcome the current information deficit and to fulfil the information need of the experts in the innovation&#8209;process.  Classical information retrieval (IR) research has been dominated by the system&#8209;oriented view in the past. A user formulates a query and then evaluates the elements found through the query according to their relevance. But this rather static setting does not always correspond to the communication and interaction needs of humans. IR systems should explicitly support also the cognitive abilities of the users in order to realize a dynamic dialogue between the user and the system. An information dialogue which does not only support an individual query but also the complete search process is necessary. Only in this way is it possible to satisfy an information need and support the innovation&#8209;process.  In this paper we present in detail three innovation scenarios to highlight the challenges of advanced information systems, query reusability and result visualisation. By defining the essential activities and conditions of a search task, it is possible to develop user interfaces which offer assistance in the form of a connection of dialogues. From this we derive the elementary information sets and activities in the next step. An example illustrates the applicability and utility of the innovation scenarios described and shows how the activities satisfy the user's information dialogue context. As part of the example we apply a cognitive walkthrough on a patent database. Aiming for an implementation of Daffodil&#8209;System we will benefit from these results.

Dynamic Knowledge and Healthcare Knowledge Ecosystems

Abstract:
The concept of Knowledge Ecosystem (KE) is used to define a community of practice that builds knowledge in a bottom&#8209;up, networked and dynamic fashion. These features define a new kind of digital ecosystem that is domain specific and operate in an open (virtual or real) world. The openness is an ideal situation that needs to apply the unified standards, for instance the Semantic Web Standards and Rules and Web 3.0 that help the building, growth, sharing and forgetting of knowledge across the Knowledge Ecosystems. What makes the KE different from the "classic" view upon the digital ecosystem is an active and dynamic process that involves: the creation of knowledge; the intentional elicitation of knowledge; the ability of share knowledge across the entities; and the possibility to depreciate and forget knowledge. How does the dynamic nature of knowledge influence the nature of knowledge ecosystems? What are the general principles that can be applied to design the sound and enduring knowledge ecosystems? These are some of the questions will try to get answers in our paper work. First of all, we will show that the dynamic evolution of knowledge and the dynamic character of the flows of knowledge are essential for the transition from digital ecosystems to knowledge ecosystems. Having a static collection of pieces of knowledge, processing them and placing them in a digital ecosystem are not really enough for this one to becomes a knowledge ecosystem. Continuous knowledge creation is responsible for transforming the digital ecosystem in a knowledge one. The process of dynamic knowledge building occurs when internal (tacit) knowledge becomes external (explicit). The continuously feedbacks that operate between internal and external knowledge are producing new knowledge among entities and create the energy and permanent innovation that characterizes a knowledge ecosystem. In the second part of the paper we have draw some general principles of accelerating the appearance of new knowledge ecosystems, while in the third section we define the main features of the knowledge healthcare ecosystem design for the home rehabilitation of people with motor disabilities. In order to do so, we are going to extract from these general principles the specific in&#8209;rules that make the agents involved in home health rehabilitation act as a knowledge ecosystem. Alongside the theoretical approach to our paper (that refers to the principles' establishing), there is also the practical one. We conclude the paper work with some remarks on the KE's role and importance in healthcare, and in particular in home rehabilitation field.

InCaS: Intellectual Capital Management in European SME â€” Its Strategic Relevance and the Importance of its Certification

Abstract:
As the Lisbon Agenda declares the aim for the European Union to become the most dynamic and competitive knowledge&#8209;based market in the world by 2010, management instruments are needed to support companies achieving this ambitious goal. Small and medium&#8209;sized companies (SMEs) are especially affected by this plan being the driving force of Europe's economy. To obtain their competitive advantage, it is crucial for SMEs to utilise knowledge efficiently and to enhance their innovation potential. Thus, managing their specific Intellectual Capital (IC) becomes more and more important for future&#8209;oriented organisations.  A practical way to tackle the challenge is the methodology developed by the German pilot project 'Wissensbilanz â€” Made in Germany' and the European pilot project 'InCaS: Intellectual Capital Statement â€” Made in Europe'. The Intellectual Capital Statement (ICS) is an instrument to assess, develop and report the IC of an organisation and to monitor critical success factors systematically. By applying this method in more than 50 German and 25 European small and medium&#8209; sized enterprises, it was possible to support the participating companies in identifying, evaluating and developing their strategically relevant knowledge.   Resulting from increased interests in managing and reporting of IC, stakeholders such as creditors or investors receive ICS in completely different qualities â€” from very reliable to implausible. To ensure the quality of ICS in a sustainable way, we have developed an approach of ICS certification based on the methods of quality management system certification, financial audit and the assessment for European Excellence Award. In the end, only the ICS fulfilling the quality requirements will be awarded a certificate. A catalogue with requirements shall serve as the certification basis and has to be in place beforehand. This catalogue evolved as an essence of both above mentioned projects and includes the experiences of ICS implementations. The challenge is to determine the smallest possible amount of requirements that will enable the ICS to meet the acknowledged quality criteria.  Furthermore, this paper summarises how the InCaS method supports companies developing a knowledge&#8209;based strategy. We describe research results gained from the German and European project about the strategic relevance of particular IC factors in general and their relevance depending on the business sector.

Abstract:
There is no credible methodology for knowledge management systems development (KMSD). We report on a KMSD approach that has emerged from an investigation based on action research and grounded theory into a number of business problems experienced by organizations. The KMSD approach is highly participatory, requiring full involvement of members of an organization. It has three interacting aspects: envisioning knowledge work behaviour, design of knowledge management system (KMS), and exploring technology options for supporting the KMS. In the first of these aspects, challenges and opportunities in an organization's current situation are analysed and an improved situation is envisioned to expose knowledge concepts and their properties. In the second, a logical design of a KMS is produced using knowledge entities, knowledge flows and knowledge interfaces; the design is guided and constrained by an organization's structure, culture, and resources. The third aspect is to do with introducing appropriate IT into KMS design, integrating organizational, social and technological aspects of the system. The paper describes this KMSD approach and how it emerged from both practical and theoretical investigation.

Value, Kaizen and Knowledge Management: Developing a Knowledge Management Strategy for Southampton Solent University
Pages:

Authors:
S J Rees
H Protheroe
Abstract:
The process of development of the strategic plan for Southampton Solent University offered a vehicle for the development of kaizen and knowledge management (KM) activities within the institution. The essential overlap between the methods offers clear benefits in the HE environment. In consideration of the aspects of KM and kaizen, various potential opportunities were identified as targets for improvement, and clarified by knowledge audit as to value and viability. The derived outcomes are listed along with some of the principal factors and perceived barriers in the practical implementation of the outcomes.  Knowledge audit applied here focused on the identification of where value arises within the business. Resource constraints and the practicalities of a people&#8209;centred system limit the permissible rate of innovation, so precise focus on the areas of business activity of most significance to the mission and client base is crucial. The fundamental question of whether such a strategy should be developed as a separate strand or embedded into existing strategies is discussed. In practice, Solent has chosen to embed, principally for reasons of maintenance of ownership and commitment.   Confidence in the process has been built through prior success with trialled activities around retention, where an activity&#8209; based pedagogic framework was adopted to address issues with an access course. Other areas of early intervention include the development and reengineering of recruitment and admissions processes, and the development of activities and pedagogy based on the virtual learning environment as exemplars of the importance of cyclical feedback in continuous improvement. The inherent complexity of processes running across the university as an organisation offers opportunities for benefits from the through&#8209;process approach implicit in kaizen. The business value of the institution is in the skills of its employees and its deployed intellectual property, and thus the importance of the enhancement of both tangible assets and intangible processes is critical to future success.

The Concept of Knowledge in KM: a Relational Model

Authors:

Abstract:
This paper reports progress in research into the applicability of the knowledge management (KM) paradigm to third sector organizations. Case studies and an action research project are described. Although KM techniques are in use, resource priorities, program funding, and dispersed authority inhibit KM in these organizations. There is little intentional consideration of the relationships between the values held by these organizations and the data gathered from experience. A relational knowledge domain model is proposed that shows how knowledge is derived from observing real or imagined universes, is stored in knowledge artifacts, and is operated on by natural and designed processes to realise future states of the universe being observed. This model is intended to promote a more holistic approach to knowledge and its management in values driven organizations but can be applied in any organization or community of practice.

The Socratic Dialogue in the Work Place: Theory and Practice

Abstract:
From recent research it emerges that addressing questions such as: How can an organisation harness collective intelligence to improve business performance? knowledge based systems?  Organizations are aware that knowledge is essential for their survival in dynamic markets, and that intellectual capital is a valuable asset. But what most organizationsÂ´ leaderships are not clear on is how to create and manage this intangible asset. It is known that investment in training is essential, but it is often unclear how this investment may be converted into improved performance?   It is well established that effective knowledge management requires a culture of sharing ideas, but how do organizations foster this type of exchange? Davenport & Prusak (1998) pointed out that if as the aphorism says, Knowledge is power, why should anyone want to share it?   This paper proposes the Socratic Dialogue (Remenyi, 2007) as one of the tools organizations can use to facilitate organizational knowledge building and exchange. The Socratic Dialogue may also be used to promote communities of practice. It facilitates the construction of knowledge through discourse based on personal experience and this can create a culture of knowledge sharing. It also promotes people being critical of prevailing ideas. The paper explores the Socratic Dialogue and its process; it illustrates its application through the analysis of two cases; and finally articulates some reflections on how to make it work effectively.

Social Networking and the Transfer of Knowledge
Pages:

Authors:
Graeme Smith
Abstract:
For the purpose of this paper, supply chain management is the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the operations as efficiently as possible within the sales and marketing environment. The supply chain spans the tracking of all transactions from the identification of prospective customers; through quote to order conversion; fulfilment; and on to post sales support. As an intense human activity customer supply chains are wholly dependent on knowledge and require social network activity to transfer that knowledge to the point of need in order to reduce process variation.  This paper builds upon work undertaken previously by the author, which developed an organisational model of the social interactions affecting knowledge transfer within organisations (Smith et al 2003). This paper also discusses the problems of knowledge location, the ability to share (as well as willingness); the prevention of knowledge attrition through a programme of knowledge definition (codification); knowledge retention; and knowledge transfer across the customer interface.   The argument is made that whilst much information is being shared, the knowledge that makes such information useful must also be transferred or new desired outcomes will not emerge. In order to share such knowledge, lessons were learned from three major studies that were carried out in 2004, 2006 and 2007; to determine the extent of failure to transfer knowledge within the sales and marketing supply chain at Ordnance Survey.  As a result of these studies, a programme of work was put in place to identify knowledge silos, acting as centres of excellence in the supply chain putting in place a project to preserve and transfer knowledge from these silos, to facilitate learning and reduce knowledge attrition.  This paper focuses on empirical evidence from these studies and the impact that this knowledge management project has had on the efficacy of the supply chain to deliver the desired outcomes.

Balancing Learning and Efficiency Crossing Practices and Projects in Project&#8209;based Organisations: Organisational Issues. The Case History of "Practice Groups" in a Consulting Firm
Pages:
pp179&#8209;190
Authors:
Saverino Verteramo

Abstract:
Project&#8209;based organizations have received increasing attention in recent years as an emerging organizational form to integrate diverse and specialized intellectual resources and expertise. A typical problem of these structures is the difficulty in sharing knowledge in and across projects. Besides, project teams are temporary and therefore much learning may be lost when they disband. Very often the storage of lessons learned is not effective; the databases are not widely used and the people are too engaged in their projects to share knowledge or help other people cope with similar problems. The inherent contradiction between organizing for meeting short&#8209;term, project task objectives, and the longer&#8209;term developmental nature of organizational learning processes asks for innovative organizational solutions. How can a project&#8209;based organization be simultaneously oriented to project&#8209;outputs and learning? The processes of knowledge capture, transfer and learning in project settings rely heavily upon social patterns and processes. This situation emphasizes the value of considering a community&#8209;based approach to managing knowledge. Several authors suggest adding a new "dimension" (a "home" for learning, integration and development of specializedtechnical competencies) following a "Crossing&#8209;approach" that leads to design organizational solutions in which project teams (focused on their strengths: outputs, processes or market segments) and learning groups, like CoPs, coexist. The aim of the paper is to investigate the critical points in designing and implementing these innovative organizational solutions (e.g. group design, reward system, participation modes, support mechanisms, formalization degree) that are difficult to manage and little investigated in the literature. We conducted an in depth case study research of an Italian IT Consulting firm: VP Tech. This analyzed firm introduced a particular kind of CoPs called "Practice Groups" (PGs) in a typical project&#8209;based organizational structure. The Practices are knowledge domains (expertises) transversal to the projects or market areas. VP senior executives chose the main strategic practices to be developed and decided to aggregate the main internal experts (PGs) around these knowledge domains. The goals of PGs are to strengthen and diffuse the knowledge developed during previous projects, to monitor the state of the art, and to support professional training and problem solving for people involved in the projects. In VP Tech, PGs represent a: network in which specifically useful information can be found; learning locus in which professional competencies can be improved; social network in which both knowledge exploitation and exploration take place. The conducted case study shows: the different phases and "crisis" in implementing this organizational solution; the specific and innovative mix between formal and informal organizational levers adopted; the circular and virtuous relation between projects and practices.

Dear Diary: Recommendations for Researching Knowledge Transfer of the Complex
Pages:
pp191&#8209;198
Authors:
Carol Webb
Abstract:
A rich&#8209;picture can unfold itself to the researcher who engages management practitioners as research participants in the task of qualitative, open&#8209;ended diary&#8209;writing while also 'feeding' the participant with reading material to consider and reflect on in the diary itself. The particular work referred to in this paper is the result of a three year long research project, from 2002&#8209;2005, where 13 research participants were, in such a vein, asked to write a weekly work&#8209; based diary over the course of a year â€” a goal which some met and others did not. The three year study sought to find out how individual managers demonstrated making sense and learning using complexity science principles in work&#8209; focussed diaries. A key insight derived offers a way forward for future research on the topic of knowledge transfer of the complex by means of diaries as a qualitative research data collection tool in conjunction with ongoing, qualitatively rich interactions between researcher and research participant.   The use of diaries by researchers shows their versatility as a research tool. Diaries have been used by researchers in the evaluation and interpretation of the practice of teaching, training and learning, in the study of meaning and emotions over time, in investigations into workers' and management's responses to change and uncertainty, to conduct research into personal relationships, in addition to the subject of personal identity and life transition, health, and the study of diaries themselves. The domain of complexity science provides thought&#8209;provoking material that both challenges and complements perspectives of day&#8209;to&#8209;day work, thinking, and life. The ways in which people contextualise complexity science principles and other complexity science material in their work differs from case to case. While the extant literature conveyed value in making sense of experiences in working life with complexity science, there was a lack of grass&#8209;roots practical evidence from the field provided in the literature. The use of the diary as a research tool was considered invaluable in the study undertaken and insights suggest the value of the diary in researching knowledge transfer of the complex in general. The underpinning literature, the method followed, highlights of the findings, and an overview of conclusions and implications for practice and future research are provided.

Abstract:
Investigates and analyzes "Knowledge Management" (KM) practices effectively implemented in the Brazilian agribusiness industry. The main objective is to investigate and analyze the conceptions, motivations, practices, metrics and results of a KM process in a genuine Brazilian firm. The qualitative research strategy used was the study of a single case with incorporated units of analysis, and two criteria were observed for the judgment of the quality of the research project: validity of the construct and reliability. Multiple sources of evidence were used and data analysis consisted of three flows of activities: data reduction, data displays and conclusion drawingverification. The results confirmed the presuppositions and the firm of the study is a benchmark for a KM process in the context of Brazilian organizations. The conclusions suggest that organizational knowledge cannot be managed, it is just promoted or stimulated through the creation of "Ba"or an enabling context. It was also identified that the main challenges facing organizations committed to KM in Brazil have its focus on change management, cultural and behavioral issues and the creation of an enabling context that favors the creation, use and sharing of information and knowledge.

Abstract:
The various dimensions of the problems of productivity and technology cannot be found in technology alone, but rather there are also human factors that either facilitate or constrain the ability of firms and workers to adopt and implement new technologies. This paper discusses the factors that contribute to Knowledge Management Systems effectiveness. Through a case study and literature reviews a general framework has been delineated. This framework describes dimensions involved in the adoption of technology at both the users and organisational level.

Leadership Imperatives of the Information Age

Abstract:
Information is becoming the engine, resource, and commodity that drives the economy and social institutions, as well as our personal and professional lives. Because we are living in a unique period of human history, we may not appreciate the scope, speed, and impact of Information Age change. Framing six characteristics of the Information Age, this paper suggests resulting imperatives for leaders who must create and lead Information Age organizations. They must leverage human and other resources, and solve today's complex and wicked problems to achieve organizational and cross&#8209;boundary goals. Global engagement, no longer limited by time or space, is enabled by worldwide information communication and technology networks that are instant, non&#8209;hierarchical, and dynamic. Smaller devices, tagging, and the integration of media and sources foster communication, collaboration, and innovation, along with new expectations for ourselves and others to be "always on" and responsive. In this dense information environment leaders face the danger of heightened decision uncertainty in a sea of meaningless, fragmented but apparently inter&#8209;connected data. Increasingly complex, chaotic, fragmented, interdependent wicked problems require new cross&#8209;boundary perspectives and deeper understanding. In the Information Age solo action focused on control of resources is giving way for former competitors to create win&#8209;win partnerships. Dynamic human networks are replacing, complementing, and competing with hierarchical organizations as powerful systems for communicating, sharing, and organizing. The authors, faculty members at a U.S. Government graduate institution, explore the essential elements of the Information Age and their imperatives for leaders, especially government leaders, who can create and lead organizations in this new environment.

Abstract:
The intersection and common elements of the fields of knowledge management (KM) and competitive intelligence (CI) are receiving growing attention, particularly in the latter discipline. Not only are the two areas similar in terms of managing knowledge resources, albeit of different types in most cases, but the presence of competitive intelligence activities begs the question of how widely knowledge assets should be developed and shared, as well as how and whether said assets should be protected. One framework for developing a strategy to balance knowledge development with knowledge protection suggests that there are specific risks (knowledge management or KM Risk and competitive intelligence or CI Risk) that move in alternate directions as knowledge is developed and shared more widely. Previous work has measured KM potentialrisk and CI risk in a variety of industries, theoretically providing industry participants with a tool to more strategically develop and protect knowledge assets. This paper continues that work, including not only the industry evaluations but in&#8209;depth analyses of firms within those industries, allowing for even deeper insights concerning optimal KMCI strategies.  These insights are drawn from evaluation of the circumstances surrounding each industry and representative firm, including the nature of the knowledge assets (explicittacit), their complexity, and their specificity (stickiness). In a sense, this is an illustrative study, providing a template for how an individual firm can evaluate its own circumstances and better manage its knowledge assets. This paper provides another step forward in establishing a framework to help firms in discovering optimal strategies for developing and protecting knowledge by extending the discussion from industries to specific firms. Continuing to draw on the same framework that defines the KM and CI tradeoff, this paper examines illustrative firms in each KMCI situation, reviewing their circumstances and their relative place in the industry vis a vis KM and CI. From this result, we can continue to develop and refine theory and practice concerning how and when KM is practised as well as how and when CI activities are deployed and defended.

Enhancing the Reusability of Inter&#8209;Organizational Knowledge: an Ontology&#8209;Based Collaborative Knowledge Management Network

Abstract:
Researchers have developed various knowledge management approaches that only focus on managing organizational knowledge. These approaches are developed in accordance with organizational KM strategies and business requirements without the concern of system interoperation. The lack of interoperability means that heterogeneous Knowledge Management Systems from different organizations are unable to communicate and integrate with one another, this results in limitation to reuse inter&#8209;organizational knowledge. Here, inter&#8209;organizational knowledge is defined as a set of explicit knowledge formalized and created by other organizations. In this research, a collaborative inter&#8209;organizational KM network is proposed to provide a platform for organizations to access and retrieve inter&#8209;organizational knowledge in a similar domain. Furthermore, ontology and its related mediation methods are incorporated in the network. The concept of ontology enables organizations to explicitly represent their knowledge of a specific domain with representational vocabulary in terms of objects and their interrelated describable relationships. Although different organizations may possess their own set of ontologies, the mediation methods that include mapping, merging and integration are capable of reconciling the underlying heterogeneities of ontologies. In this way, it is possible for the participant organizations to reuse inter&#8209;organizational knowledge within the network even though there are fundamental differences among organizations in terms of KMS structures and knowledge formats. The retrieved inter&#8209;organizational knowledge could then be used to support knowledge creating, storing, dissemination, using and evaluation of the organizational KM process. In additional, a selection framework is also proposed to assist organizations in choosing suitable ontology mediation approaches, ranging from mapping approaches, levels of automation, mediation methods to matching techniques. While knowledge engineers could reuse inter&#8209;organizational knowledge to create and evaluate organizational knowledge, general users are benefit from the effectiveness and efficiency in searching for relevant inter&#8209;organizational knowledge within the network.

Designing a Strategy Formulation Process for New, Technology&#8209;Based Firms: a Knowledge&#8209;based Approach
Pages:
pp245&#8209;254
Authors:
Antonios Livieratos
Abstract:
In the knowledge&#8209;based economy the nature of what is strategic has been modified along with the importance of knowledge and its management. One of the most important implications of these changes is the expansion of resources and products that are globally tradable, highlighting the importance of knowledge as the key economic resource of lasting competitive advantage. As a consequence of this shift in the economy, an increasing number of industries are moving from the closed innovation model to the open innovation model that created porous boundaries between the innovative company and its surrounding environment, changing the interand intra&#8209;organizational modes of coordination. In an environment where knowledge is the key economic resource and the open innovation model is applied in more and more industries, we are experiencing the increasing importance of the New Technology&#8209;Based Firm (NTBF). NTBFs face a number of difficulties mainly associated with a lack of resources and entrepreneurial skills and in order overcome the difficulties NTBFs strive towards flexibility while accelerating the development and commercialization processes by creating andor entering business networks. By adopting a knowledge&#8209;based view for NTBFs and consequently placing knowledge in the centre of a systemic innovation model, knowledge networks constitute an asset for NTBFs. As this new form of cooperation takes multiple and often unpredictable forms it is thus essential to develop strategy formulation tools and processes that can help NTBFs to face their challenges. Until now little attention has been given to the development of strategy tools and processes tailored for the requirements of NTBFs. The present paper presents a concept to cope with NTBFs' by developing a generic process for strategy formulation. In this respect, an action research project was initiated. The proposed concept was initially designed, although not exclusively, for a Greek NTBF, Astrofos Ltd. The author, who is coordinator of the incubator where Astrofos is sited, is acting as a strategy consultant for the firm and has taken part in all its major decisions since summer 2007. In order to build the strategy formulation process, this paper proposes a mapping technique that attempts to depict a NTBF's tangible and intangible transactions as well as the strength of ties between the focal NTBF and its partners and the complexity of the knowledge. In developing the mapping technique, we have used a combination of the concept of weak ties, derived from social network analysis, with the notion of complex knowledge, as this combination was initially proposed by Hansen (1999). Additionally, a set of questions is proposed that have to be answered in order to pass from knowledge identification to knowledge transfer, from a strategic point of view. In this regard, the presented methodology constitutes an effort, on the one hand, to study the emergent patterns in what is considered to be a chaotic or disordered system and, on the other, to stimulate the creation of new patterns in the system that would be consistent with the NTBF's strategy.

Abstract:
One of the main objective of educators is to identifying inspiring and interactive approach to learning, and to encourage students to be more receptive and co&#8209;operative in the classroom. To help educators in achieving these goals we employed constructivist epistemology and constructivist cognitive psychology, together with the use of Mind Maps and Mobile Knowledge (M&#8209;K) Toolkit. The toolkit can serve as the foundation for a new kind of integration of Internet resources and all classroom, laboratory, field experiences, and when used with "expert skeletal" Mind Maps to scaffold learning. It is our thesis that good theory&#8209;based use of the appropriate technology can increase the benefits of using Mind Maps in education and lead to dramatically improved education. In this paper we first explored the Mind Maps Concept, then we presented and explained the advantages of M&#8209;K toolkit and how this can support mind mapping and integration of a whole array of learning experiences. In the last section we presented two case studies to provide the evidence of how the M&#8209;K toolkit and Mind Maps can lead to education paradigm shift and enhance the outcome of the learning experience in higher education.

Abstract:
An important aspect of knowledge management is the implementation of methods to share the unstructured knowledge of expert practitioners within an organization. The existence of unstructured and dynamic knowledge represents a challenge to experts due to the dynamic and non&#8209;sequential nature of such knowledge. In order to make such knowledge sharable, it is necessary to have both an effective elicitation method and a useful representation toolkit. In this paper we describe a Dynamic Knowledge Toolkit (DKT) that is used in knowledge elicitation and representation based upon Knowledge maps. Knowledge Maps content is different from the more general information in typical reference material and that is organized quite differently than standard textbook knowledge or mainstream hypermedia learning systems. These knowledge models tend to be large and complex with interwoven themes and rich interconnections of the concepts based on the expert's highly articulated mental model of the domain. Knowledge Maps have been used in all facets of education, training and business. With the fundamental goal of fostering learning and knowledge sharing they have been shown to be an effective tool for displaying prior knowledge, summarizing, planning, scaffolding for understanding, consolidating experiences, improving affective conditions for critical thinking, decision making, supporting cooperation and collaboration, and organizing unstructured knowledge content. We describe the use of the toolkit in a case study on the capture and representation of local weather forecasting knowledge. We also show how Knowledge maps can be used to support activities such as the preservation of institutional memory, the "recovery" of expertise that might reside in less accessible forms such as archived documents, for performance support, and for other knowledge&#8209;intensive pursuits such as weather forecasting or crisis management.

Title:
Questioning the Positive Effect of External Knowledge Transfer Incurred by Industry Attractiveness: the Case of Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs)

Abstract:
The contribution of knowledge transfer to an organization's overall performance outcomes has become one of the central themes of investigation among the theorists and scholars in the field of knowledge management. This paper questions the positive effect of external knowledge transfer on an organization's financial performance, taking into account that even coordinated knowledge transfer is time consuming and likely to impair the performance outcomes when the conditions appropriate for obviating the inherent difficulty of knowledge transfer are not established. Its aim is to examine the fundamental role of the attractiveness of industry as a main moderator in an external knowledge&#8209;transfer activity which takes place between two parties in an alliance. Consistent with prior work on knowledge management this study argues that transfer costs are determinative factors for an organization's performance and include: (i) the considerable amount of time spent searching in order to identify the appropriate new knowledge required, (ii) the effort to effectively distribute this knowledge between the parties of an alliance and (iii) the time needed for the external knowledge to be implemented effectively to an organization's daily processes. The case to be examined is that of organizations which are in great need of obtaining and using new knowledge to achieve business model innovation. This kind of organizations is more likely to be affected by search and transfer costs since they are trying to reduce time&#8209;to&#8209; market entry, thus, achieving first mover advantage. A plausible source of knowledge for these organizations (knowledge seekers) is the formation of strategic alliances with organizations which not only possess the required knowledge (knowledge keepers) but also operate in attractive environments. An attractive environment, among others, is liable to frequent entries of new players and this may not give time to such organizations to elaborate and effectively utilize the knowledge that is externally derived. These assumptions are shaped on an overarching conceptual framework, which identifies the role of the attractiveness of the industry and delineates research propositions, taking the Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) as a case study. To determine the attractiveness of the mobile telecom industry we apply Porter's five forces framework and then we draw on a number of interviews which allows us to provide data suggesting that with an increase in the number of new entrants in the mobile telecom industry, an increase in the amount of knowledge derived externally may reduce the organization's ability to increase its performance outcomes.

Abstract:
e&#8209;Business is a phenomenon that has progressed over the past decades at record speed, with considerable promise and hype. It has been embraced with varying degrees of enthusiasm and impact by both large and SME firms. Parallel with its development, E&#8209;Business has attracted research interests, seen in a plethora of new modules, programmes, models and tools. Knowledge Management (KM) is one tool that has seemed to gain a more relevant role, especially as managing knowledge becomes increasingly important to all companies. Appropriate KM practices within organisations can be seen as one of the prerequisites of enhancement of continuous performance improvement in the interne&#8209;based context. Thus, our aim is to develop a conceptual framework related to KM practices in a virtual context and to identify the nature of the relationship existing in those knowledge&#8209;driven elements and performance achievements. This paper aims to bridge the gap between the KM and e&#8209;business performance&#8209;related literatures from the viewpoint of European firms by establishing a model tested in European companies. For this purpose, we used a structural equation modelling analysis. The results show that KM has a positive impact on the maximization of e&#8209;business performance and that some elements individually have a positive influence on e&#8209;business performance. As limitations of the study, we consider the need for more research into this field and the inclusion of news elements such as technological readiness and management support to KM initiatives. The present study advances knowledge on the nature of the relative importance of different components of Internet&#8209;based KM as drivers of e&#8209;business performance and reinforce its importance as an integrated e&#8209;business tool.

Abstract:
The "triple helix" model is considered as being a spiral model of innovation contributing to the country and regional improvement by fostering interactions between academic, industry and government. This model highlights the ties between the three parties at different stages in the process of knowledge capitalization and flow. Although, this model has proven to be effective in some countries, some questions remain regarding its effective implementation in Thailand. This paper presents an adapted version of the helix model that could contribute to development of ties among stakeholders through strategic alliances. The success key factors leading to an economic development mission by universities are as well discussed.

Abstract:
It is unanimously agreed that a business communication curriculum plays an important role in preparing students for the workforce in the corporate (Pittenger, Khushwant K. S.; Miller, Mary C. & Allison, Jesse, 2006; Zhao, Jensen J. & Alexander, Melody W., 2004). However, Student population in India undertaking a program in business management primarily comprises those for whom English is a second language. In this scenario, it becomes extremely important to analyze how the faculty teaching business management students perceive the course of business communication and students' possession of business communication skills (Plutsky, Susan & Wilson, Barbara A., 1996). In this connection, very little work has been done on the perceptions of faculty teaching business management students in India. What are the areas of business communication curriculum which faculty perceives as important? What are those areas of business communication in which faculty feel students are more competent? Should something be added to the curriculum to make it more effective? This study enters this discussion by presenting a small empirical study of a faculty's perception of the business communication needs of students. A sample of 93 faculty members, teaching with AICTE accredited management institutions in India have expressed their opinion on the said issue by way of questionnaires. The ultimate goal is to reorient the curriculum of business communication according to the findings of the present study.

Knowledge Sharing in Academic Institutions: a Study of Multimedia University Malaysia

Authors:
Ming-YuCheng
Abstract:
Recent developments have witnessed the emergence of a new economy where knowledge has become a valuable resource and asset. The dynamism of the new economy requires us to not only quickly create knowledge, but also to acquire and apply knowledge quickly. One possible way to do so is to share our knowledge effectively.  Knowledge sharing is envisaged as a natural activity of the academic institutions as the number of seminars, conferences and publications by academics is far exceeding any other profession, signifying the eagerness of academics to share knowledge. However, instead of knowledge sharing, "knowledge hoarding" could be more prevalent in academic institutions. This paper examines knowledge sharing behavior among academics in a private university in Malaysia. Factors affecting the willingness to share knowledge, broadly classified as organizational, individual and technology factors, are examined. The overall findings revealed that incentive systems and personal expectation are the two key factors in driving academics to engage in knowledge sharing activity. "Forced" participation is not an effective policy in cultivating sharing behavior among academics.

Organisational Knowledge Base and Knowledge Transfer in the Shipping Industry

Abstract:
Severe shortages of skilled and qualified personnel in the shipping industry have been addressed in different ways. This paper looks into the issue from a new perspective where high mobility in the shipping industry is seen as a vehicle of knowledge flows that can be used for knowledge transfer. This paper argues that while organisations cannot stop personnel leaving, it is possible, however, to retain part of the knowledge that these leaving personnel carry through effective knowledge management practices. This paper introduces organizational knowledge base (OKB) and identifies knowledge flows both at organizational and industrial levels showing that much can be done to effectively utilise knowledge spillovers brought about by high personnel mobility in the shipping industry. The paper then examines the barriers and facilitators of knowledge transfer in the context of the shipping industry. Due to the unique characteristics of the shipping industry such as the absence of genuine employment link between seafarers, and the remoteness of the onboard workplace from the onshore management, conventional knowledge management practices need to be modified to suit the context of the shipping industry. The paper suggests that advanced information and communication technologies, a dedicated knowledge sharing culture, and strong leadership are essential factors in facilitating knowledge transfer in the context of shipping. The implications of the application of knowledge management practices in the shipping industry are two fold: one is the change of perspectives towards the shortage of skilled personnel in the shipping industry which in turn impacts on maritime education and training; the other is the realignment of resources in tackling the problem of skill shortages, that is, a shift from employee retention to knowledge retention. It is expected that such an attempt will shed light on the understanding of skill shortages from a different perspective and provide insight on the tasks that the shipping industry is facing.

Leveraging Knowledge Understanding in Documents
Pages:
pp341&#8209;352
Authors:
Moria Levy
Abstract:
In the past years Knowledge Management has dealt with various aspects of knowledge retention, knowledge sharing and knowledge development. It is agreed that knowledge documentation is essential for all these purposes, in order to enable their re&#8209;use. Many books and articles have been written on accessibility of documents, revealing an understanding that knowledge that cannot be accessed cannot be re&#8209;used. Most effort has been invested in providing the focused list of relevant documents to the user, while less research has been conducted on how to write the documentation so as to ease its reading, understanding and use. This issue seems to be critical as we notice that existing organizational knowledge is far from being fully utilized: for example, regulations and procedures, including the organization's wisdom, are written; however, recurring faults do occur. People tend not to re&#8209;read entire or partial documents, even when the knowledge therein is needed. This paper describes a framework for the document's internal design. The research hypothesis claims that internal design, using the proposed enabling technique, eases understanding and usage of documents. It therefore reduces the knowledge loss. The research methodology implemented was a qualitative method; the strategy chosen was instrumental: multiple case study (Stake, 1995). The research sample included both organizations (public sector) and the public (KM readers), the research instruments consisting of documentation, archival records, interviews, direct&#8209;observations, participant&#8209;observation and physical artifacts. The findings suggest that internal documentation design eases reading, eases understanding and probably eases use. It therefore leverages knowledge understanding in documents, and reduces knowledge loss. The proposed framework may be useful for a large range of organizational documentation needs, from procedures of work, through SOW's, Engineering Specs, white papers and professional doctrines including organizational knowledge. The framework was designed for organizational Knowledge Management needs, but serves for external rich knowledge documentation as well. It has been used since 2007, in more than fifty cases in five different organizations in Israel.

Title:
Knowledge Management Model for Information Technology Support Service
Pages:
pp353&#8209;367
Authors:
Maria Mvungiand Ian Jay
Abstract:
User support has been in existence since the inception of computers in business and with their workforce dependent on technology, organizations depend on the quality of information technology (IT) support services to quickly restore and prevent any downtime due to any failure in technology or its use. Standardization of systems, and the speed with which knowledge becomes redundant, means that support&#8209;personnel technical knowledge is gained and discarded on a continuing basis. This research evaluates how an organization can conceptualize knowledge management (KM) of IT Support in order to maximize user productivity. Grounded Theory approach is used to explore the knowledge management activities and processes present within the Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) group of a multidisciplinary research centre called iThemba Laboratory for Accelerator Based Science (LABS). Firstly, the approach involved participant observation to gather information about the work flow of EIT support forming the first attempt at open coding. Secondly, semi&#8209;structured interviews, as well as the use of the Repertory Grid Technique were used to gather multiple perspectives of support personnel. Extant literature was then incorporated to develop the emergent theory. This research found that the knowledge management foundation for IT Support is strategy and culture based on the constructs of commitment and reciprocity. Further, communication and competency were identified as additional enabling conditions. From this, an adapted KM model for IT Support Service is presented. The model agrees with Nonaka and Konno's 'ba' concept within the Socialization&#8209;Externalization&#8209;Combination&#8209;Internalization (SECI) process. Every transition between the quadrants representing ba (knowledge platforms) requires 'conversion energy', in agreement with IT Service Management Service Management Functions of Microsoft's Operations Framework.

Situated, Embodied Human Interaction and its Implications for Context Building in Knowledge Mobilisation Design
Pages:
pp368&#8209;377
Authors:
Erkki Patokorpi
Abstract:
System design is mostly guided by the computational model of the mind, known as computational cognitivism. This model, traditionally based on Turing's Universal Machine, looms large behind the bulk of system design even in Intelligence Augmentation (IA) approach to human&#8209;computer interaction, although with the seemingly obvious exception of connectionist approaches (e.g. neural networks, swarm intelligence). Other extensive computational models do exist (e.g. Hintikka and Mutanen's trial&#8209;and&#8209;error computability model and Peirce's semiotic model) but they have not yet been implemented in working computer systems. Computational cognitivism pictures the mind as a disembodied, decontextualized calculating machine, operating with logical&#8209; syntactic rules and principles. This view has in contemporary times been challenged from the quarters of biology, sociology, anthropology, linguistics, psychology and economics. Perhaps the best comprehensive label for this critical approach is grounded cognition. Grounded cognition conceptualises the mind as a complex process related to and partially constituted by body, environment, other minds and artefacts, thus calling for a corresponding re&#8209;evaluation of knowing, understanding, learning, perception, action, interaction and reasoning. The aim of this paper is to tentatively examine whether these insights into natural cognition could inform the system design of mobile systems which support nomadic knowledge workers as well as the man in the street. Computer supported (automated) context building is of special interest here as the human way(s) of being in the world presents a particular challenge to this part of system design.

Power, Discursive Practices and the Construction of the "Real"

pp378&#8209;387
Authors:
Alketa Peci
Marcelo Vieira
Abstract:
Starting with a critique of the epistemological and ontological bases of neo&#8209;institutionalism, in this article we defend the potential for the application of post&#8209;structuralist perspectives to the institutional approach. We contend that this theoretical approach, which incorporates an element, traditionally overlooked in institutional analyses, namely power, has the advantage of contributing to an enhanced comprehension of the dynamics of institutionalization. We apply post&#8209;structural perspectives, particularly as presented by Michel Foucault, as well as the pragmatic perspectives represented by the works of William James and Richard Rorty, to explicating underpinnings of the institutional approach. We would stress that the affinity between the post&#8209;structural perspective and pragmatism has been acknowledged by other authors, such as Keller (1995), McSwite (1997) and Rorty (1999) himself. Incorporating the element of power into the analysis contributes to an enhanced comprehension of the dynamics of institutionalization. In conclusion, we believe that the area of organizational studies would benefit by a more all&#8209;encompassing vision of the processes of institutionalization, which would include power at its core, instead of considering institutions as non&#8209;changing variables. Clegg (1989) has provided a framework for such analysis and this paper serves to elaborate what some of its philosophical foundations might be in greater detail. We would stress that it is not possible to find answers if we just search for cause&#8209;effect relations, because the explanations found through causal mechanisms constitutes, in itself, a kind of discourse of power, as pointed out by moderns such as Hobbes (1650). Undoubtedly, if we take empirical research into consideration, what we need is, from a historical perspective, understand the way by which the main discourses or narratives constitute, transform and are transformed by our objects of investigation, among which organizations certainly occupy a central place. However, it is necessary to tackle this undertaking with a certain degree of humility, abandoning the search for ultimate causes to more proximate and local narratives, small stories that communicate their own sense of the mechanisms of truth at work. And in these matters, we should be bullied into causality.

Title:
Pluralism in Knowledge Management: a Review
Pages:
pp388&#8209;397
Authors:
James Sheffield
Abstract:
The purpose of this article is to review the role of simultaneous application of multiple perspectives, or pluralism, in knowledge management, and to describe theoretical frameworks that support pluralism. Pluralism is defined as support for all three of the systems perspectives â€” hard, soft, and critical â€” that are implicit in the popular Davenport and Prusak (1998) definition of knowledge. These perspectives are associated with research paradigms (positivist, interpretivist, pluralist) and knowledge perspectives (application, normalization, creation). A case study of coordinating work in a hospital is reviewed to illustrate the role played by pluralistic approaches in knowledge management. A literature search is conducted to find frameworks that support pluralism. The findings are as follow. In the hospital case study the introduction of a patient record system (hard system) was the occasion for changes to both coordination (soft systems) and power relations (critical systems). Facts, norms and feelings are intertwined. While the electronic tool by itself is neutral in the face of power relations, its use in organisations is not. In this case at least, a holistic and pluralistic approach to knowledge management is required. In the search for frameworks to support pluralism, more than 50 frameworks from the general knowledge management literature are identified. Of the eight selected for further study, three are found to be pluralistic. These three â€” critical systems, scientific discourses, and Habermasian inquiry â€” share common characteristics. All three recognise that conflict is the precondition to knowledge creation, and that power relations, value commitments, and ethics are central to knowledge management. It is concluded that the knowledge management literature as a whole favours a single systems perspective (hard systems); a single research paradigm (positivism, focusing on objective facts); and a single knowledge management domain (knowledge application). This singular (non&#8209;pluralistic) approach produces theories about knowledge that has already emerged. Yet the Davenport and Prusak (1998) definition of knowledge and the hospital case study include two other perspectives â€” soft systems and critical systems â€” that focus on the organizational and individual aspects of emergence, respectively. In practice, knowledge management must address the need to simultaneously solve technical problems, resolve interpersonal issues, and dissolve personal conflict. The contribution of the paper is the comparison of knowledge management frameworks on the basis of underlying system perspectives, and the identification, description, and application of some pluralistic frameworks. Each systems perspective constitutes a different discourse on the purposes served by knowledge management, and pluralisms are required to integrate them. Pluralisms constitute both a framework for inquiry in knowledge management and a design theory for collaborative technologies. The review is not exhaustive. It is beyond the scope of this paper to examine the link between the purposes served by knowledge management and the methodology required for development. The paper contributes to the literature that seeks to understand the complexity of knowledge management practice via 'awareness of the potential and the implications of the different discourses in the study of knowledge and knowledge management.'

In Search of Alternative Metaphors for Knowledge; Inspiration from Symbolism

Marien Van Den Boom
Abstract:
Conceptual metaphors play a vital role in our ability to think in abstract terms like knowledge. Metaphors structure and give meaning to the concept of knowledge. They hide and highlight certain characteristics. The choice of metaphor when reasoning about knowledge is therefore of vital importance for knowledge management (KM). This paper explores the possibility of introducing new knowledge metaphors to the field of KM. Based on a 'wish list' of characteristics of knowledge they want to highlight, the authors choose to explore the Knowledge as a Journey metaphor as a new metaphor for knowledge. This results in new insights regarding knowledge sharing, acquisition, retention, and innovation.

Abstract:
Knowledge management (KM) is difficult to pin down. It means different things in different organisations. The deliberate use of metaphors has been used to communicate what KM is about. This metaphorical communication can be even more enriched using visual as well as language mechanisms: "a picture paints a thousand words" suggests we can capture more resonances of a complex subject like KM through visuals than through a description alone. In addition, visuals are perceived to transcend the limitations of language, which can be an obstacle to communication. Yet, no method currently exists that we can use to identify KM metaphors used in visuals. This paper describes our search for a method to analyse metaphors used in visuals about knowledge management. Our objective was threefold: 1) identifying new metaphors for KM in visuals that can enrich KM theorizing, 2) developing a way to identify which visuals are the most powerful in communicating KM theory, and 3) improving the use of visuals as a way of assessing students studying KM. We found that analysing metaphors used in KM visuals is possible using a method that focuses on the dominant metaphors in a visual.

Title:
The Frontier of Linearity in the Intellectual Capital Metaphor

pp415&#8209;424
Authors:
Constantin Bratianu
Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that linearity is a major limitation of the metaphor Knowledge as Capital. This metaphor proposed by Daniel Andriessen as a challenging debate for ECIC 2009 has been extremely fruitful in promoting knowledge as a new field of interest in economic research and praxis. Since Capital is a core concept of any economic activity, using it as a semantic source for the newly coined expression, Intellectual Capital, proved to be a winning idea. However, any metaphor highlights certain things and hides others. There are some semantic frontiers in the source domain which constitute its limitations. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the linearity property of the source domain, and to demonstrate that it constitutes a major limitation of the IC metaphor. We begin with the mathematical definition of a linear space, and then we analyse how this definition requirements, which are fulfilled within the source domain, cannot be fulfilled within the target domain. We are interested especially in the following requirements of the linear space: commutativity, associativity, distributivity and the application of the principle of superposition. The Knowledge domain does not satisfy any of these requirements which means that the target domain is strongly nonlinear. Although many authors have used these concepts of linearity and nonlinearity in connection with knowledge and intellectual capital, none of them undertook a systematic analysis of the basic properties of linear spaces and how they fit within the knowledge field. Linearity is strongly related to the measurable property of the source domain, and this operational connection explains why many methods proposed to measure knowledge and intellectual capital failed to produce good results. We shall extend our analysis to linear and nonlinear thinking patterns, showing how the frontier of linearity can impair managerial decisions. We hope that our work will stimulate new research aiming at using properly the nonlinearity property of the Knowledge field.

Authors:
Sladjana Cabrilo
Abstract:
This paper presents a wide&#8209;ranging research and analysis of intellectual capital within the Serbian business environment. The primary research objective was to scrutinize organizational intellectual capital within different industries in order to facilitate the fine&#8209;tuning of intellectual capital reporting according to particular facets of industry. The role of intellectual capital value drivers in the process of intellectual capital reporting focused this research on the identification of relevant intellectual capital value drivers, as well as the specific features of intellectual capital and knowledge flows within the observed industries. The results have revealed some specific features of industries, thus indicating inter&#8209;industry variety from the perspective of intellectual capital. This research should be viewed, first as a contribution to the refinement of existing intellectual capital reporting methods with respect to unique characteristics of these industries, and second as a case where the different stages of the evolution of intellectual capital between different culturescountries is presented.

Title:
The Meaning of Intangible Assets: New Insights into External Company Succession in SMEs
Pages:
pp437&#8209;446
Authors:
Susanne Durst
Stefan Gueldenberg
Abstract:
The Commission of the European Communities (2006) estimates in its report that one third of all EU entrepreneurs will leave within the next ten years. In conjunction with the situation that (1) the majority of Europeans prefer being an employee and (2) the fact that changes in demography will reduce the pool of potential successors over the next decades, this paper argues that external (non&#8209;family) successors take on an important role and are in a position to choose the company, which best matches their expectations. A successful company succession depends on a multitude of different aspects. In the case of external succession, certainly the available funds represent a critical point. However, the assumption is that the decision to acquire a company is based on other factors. It is hypothesised that the potential external successor will be interested in those companies offering potential expansions. In view of the increasing relevance of intangible assets within the firm regarding company success, it is suggested that these assets primarily influence the external successor to go further in the succession process. Thus, it is expected that the future perspectives of the company are founded on its inherent intangibles and which in turn justify a financial investment. The aim of this paper is to explore the role of intangible assets as seen from the viewpoints of external successors. The strategy of research behind this paper is the application of a mixed methods approach which is divided into a survey approach and a case study approach (given priority). Within the quantitative stage a web&#8209;survey was used to obtain data on the relevance of intangible assets in terms of external company succession in SMEs whilst addressing members of German trade corporations and chambers of commerce. The results of the quantitative study were enhanced through qualitative interviews with ten external successors in SMEs. The data that were gathered explores the role of intangible assets during the successors' deliberations as to whether or not the company should be acquired. Intangible assets are found to be important features for external successors. Specifically five intangibles can be highlighted which are brand, partner(s), key&#8209;employees, knowledge retention, and corporate culture. The critical intangibles were summarised in a conceptual framework. The findings suggest that in the case of external succession, intangible assets have a remarkable influence on the external successor's decision&#8209;making and traditional issues in the view of company succession such as tax, legal and, financial aspects should be extended to include intangible aspects.

Title:
Identifying a Suitable Approach for Measuring and Managing Public Service Productivity
Pages:
pp447&#8209;458
Authors:
Aki JÃ¤Ã¤skelÃ¤inen
Abstract:
Every public organisation faces the challenge of improving productivity. In this effort, productivity measures are essential managerial tools. However, the task of measuring service productivity has proven to be challenging. A key reason for the challenges seems to be related to the intangibility of services. The objective of this paper is to identify and apply a productivity measurement method satisfying the information requirements of public managers. The study is carried out using a qualitative case study approach. The paper consists of two parts: first, the current knowledge of the issue is examined by reviewing the literature on (service) productivity and performance measurement; second, an action research is carried out in the context of four case services of the City of Helsinki, Finland. A disaggregated approach to productivity measurement is applied. Three different measurement frameworks and methods are evaluated in light of practical criteria for measurement. Finally, a matrix method is chosen and applied in practice. As a result the paper provides more understanding of the process of applying the disaggregated productivity measurement approach in the context of public welfare services.

How to Conduct the Audit of Intellectual Capital in Polish Tourism Business?
Pages:
pp459&#8209;468
Authors:
El bieta Maria Kot
Abstract:
Intellectual capital (IC) â€” defined by the values such as knowledge, skills, experience, organisational, social and cultural relations etc. â€” is one of the most important assets of tourism business and can be perceived as the factor having the greatest influence on the company's value. Due to the leading role of intangible assets in tourism sector, it is important to specify the IC structure and diagnose IC assets for tourism industry. The results of the diagnosis should be taken into consideration in IC management and in the decision&#8209;making process within the organisation. The diagnosis of the IC condition is an issue which has not been the subject of any detailed research in Polish environment. The lack of specific tools as well as the real need for resolving the title problem has been the inspiration for a deeper investigation. The goal of the undertaken research was to prepare the methods of IC audit in tourism companies and to create necessary, utilitarian auditing tools. The main objective was to be achieved by performing the research tasks presented in the paper, among which the most important are: Review of the theory and different IC valuating and measuring methods (literature of the subject). Executing the initial research among experts, executives and employees of tourism market, using Individual in&#8209;Depth Interview (IDI) and participant observation methods. Preparation of an IC audit's algorithms. Programming a software of IC audit implementation. Application of the IC audit prototype to an experimental group with the aim of eliminating any methodological and technical faults. Implementation of the IC audit in chosen Polish tourism companies. Presentation of the results (reporting). The initial research clearly indicated, that the knowledge resulting from an IC audit is useful and necessary for executives. Reporting of IC audit lets managers identify and highlight the missing or neglected elements of IC structure and recommends certain activities in management procedures, designed to enhance business performance. This paper presents the results of the research done so far, but the main goal is to implement the IC audit tool in Polish tourism companies and prove its efficiency.

Measuring the Impacts of an IC Development Service: the Case of the Pietari Business Campus

pp469&#8209;480
Authors:
Paula Kujansivu
Antti LÃ¶nnqvist
Abstract:
Intellectual capital (IC) development includes a wide set of activities focusing on the improvement of an organisation's intangible resources. However, it is often unclear what kind of impacts different IC initiatives have. The current literature lacks appropriate methods for identifying and measuring them. If it is not possible to assess the impact of various development activities it is difficult to justify IC investments or choose between alternative service providers. This paper, based on a case study, examines how to assess the impacts of an IC development initiative. The empirical research setting is the Pietari Business Campus, a knowledge&#8209;intensive business service organisation providing various development services for its twelve member companies operating in the St. Petersburg region in Russia. In this paper, the literature is first examined to understand how the impacts of development activities can be assessed in different contexts. The characteristics of these approaches are then utilised to formulate the assessment methodology used in the case study. The empirical assessment consists of both numerical indicator data and subjective interview data. The case study showed that the activities and outputs can be measured quite accurately but that the outcomes are difficult to capture. The main challenge results from external changes taking place and making it difficult to observe the outcomes of development activities. Due to the challenging nature of the assessment task and the relatively low managerial priority of the issue (on the customers' side) it is suggested that subjective assessment methods may provide sufficient information in many cases. Although this paper is focused on IC development, there may be similar contexts in other knowledge&#8209;intensive services in which the lessons of this study might be useful.

Business Model Evolution in IA  IC Support Centres and the Role of Market&#8209;Making
Pages:
pp481&#8209;488
Authors:
Iain Russell
Abstract:
This paper addresses some of the issues for 'migrating' the 'business model of IA  IC support centres depending upon the developing nature of their roles over time. It explores how centres may be sustained over a sufficient period of time to impact economically at a local, regional or national level. In state or project&#8209;funded centres it is sometimes difficult to maintain levels of funding over a sustained period of time due to the 'project' nature of many funding schemes. Indeed many of the initiatives in this field globally over the last 10&#8209;15 years have been noticeably transient. As a consequence the assets which might be created are not adequately transferred to more long&#8209;lasting bodies which might be able to exploit them further. To strategically manage a centre often means looking for business models which can sustain the work of the centre over a period of time longer than projects (in excess of five years) to create economic impacts. The paper therefore particularly reflects upon the role of such centres in market&#8209;making (or maybe more accurately market&#8209;proving) should such a role be envisaged for it. The rationale which may lead to the need to explore the making or proving of a market in IA  IC support is reviewed as well as the drivers for strategy adjustment which may lead to role changes for support centres. Roles which might bear market return as against those which are unlikely to have commercial returns are examined in the paper. The barriers to making changes in the business model are explored as well as the potential benefits for the users of such centres as well as their funders. The exit routes for the public sector are reviewed. The paper should assist in helping other centres with similar issues. The paper suggests further areas of research for scholars to help illuminate some of the issues which are highlighted in the paper.

Intellectual Capital of the European Union 2008: Measuring the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs

Authors:
Christiaan Stam
Daan Andriessen
Abstract:
In 2004 we published the report Intellectual capital of the European Union (Andriessen & Stam, 2004). In this report we provided insight in the value of the intellectual capital of the 15 countries of the European Union, in relationship to the goals set by the European Council in March 2000. The main Lisbon goal was to become "the most competitive and knowledge&#8209;based economy in the world" in 2010. Since our previous report, the EU grew from 15 to 27 countries and the Lisbon goals were reformulated in 2005. The aim of this paper is to measure the IC of the competitive and dynamic knowledge&#8209;based economy, the EU decided to focus on "delivering stronger, lasting growth and creating more and better jobs" (CEC, 2005d, p.7). In this paper we translate this overall goal in 38 indicators. As the data was not available for all the new member states, we decided to limit our paper to the so&#8209; called EU&#8209;19. Based on our measurements we conclude that the EU&#8209;19 is still behind Japan and far behind the USA, however the EU is catching up as both Japan and the USA have considerably lower growth figures than the EU&#8209;19. From an IC perspective, the EU is geographically divided. The Nordic countries are still the best performing countries. The southern European countries and the new member states stay behind. However, as the new member states invest more in their IC, it might be expected that their positions will improve in the future. Of all the new member states the Czech Republic has the best potential. The aim of our paper was to measure the progress of the Lisbon Agenda for growth and jobs. Based on our measurements we conclude that the EU&#8209;19 is successful in terms of creating more and better jobs, but not successful in terms of delivering stronger, lasting growth. In order to further close the competitiveness gap, the EU should primarily focus on strengthening its SC and RC.

Title:
The Impact of Welfare State Development on Social Trust Formation: an Empirical Investigation
Pages:
pp501&#8209;508
Authors:
Larysa Tamilina
Abstract:
Social trust is shaped by many society&#8209;level as well as individual&#8209;level factors. One of the determinants highly debated in literature is the welfare state which reflects the level of state intervention in organizing individuals' welfare. Theoretical as well as empirical studies are in their vast majority controversial with respect to the kind of effects welfare state may have on social trust formation. However, all of them have one element in common â€” they measure welfare state development through social spending. The main objective of this research consists of demonstrating that in order to precisely estimate this impact, it is necessary to introduce a new operationalization for welfare state development which would reflect the outcomes rather than the process of the state intervention into individuals' arrangements. The latter can be obtained by decomposing Esping&#8209;Andersen's welfare regime typology and directly evaluating the effects of decommodification and stratification on social trust indexes. This hypothesis is checked based on a cross&#8209;sectional analysis for a set of 18 OECD countries while using multi&#8209;level modelling as the main research method. The individual&#8209;level analysis demonstrates that de&#8209; commodification enhances trust formation. The aggregated&#8209;level analysis allows for explaining that this positive effect of decommodification on social trust mainly goes through reduction of income inequality which is the key aim of social policies. Moreover, the analysis demonstrates that the quality of public institutions, in general, and welfare institutions, in particular, conducts essential influence on the level of trust in the societies. Besides decommodification, the form of social stratification was found to matter for social trust. Preserving existing class structure inherent to conservative welfare regime type influences negatively institutional trust, but positively interpersonal trust. Stigmatizing approach apt to liberal welfare state erodes interpersonal trust, but boosts institutional trust. Finally, socialism's universal approach leads to crowding&#8209;in effects in both forms of social trust.

Using Scenarios to Explore the Potential for Shifts in the Relative Priority of Human, Structural and Relational Capital in Generating Value

pp509&#8209;516
Authors:
Christine van Winkelen
Jane McKenzie
Abstract:
Collaborative research over a two year period involving eighteen knowledge management practitioners and a team of academics explored the evolution of a next generation knowledge management agenda. Three scenarios were developed that explored the implications of two dimensions: firstly the underpinning organisational purpose in relation to the factors of production in both an industrial and a knowledge economy paradigm, and secondly the consequences of a predominantly transactional or relational psychological contract between individuals and organisations. By studying the drivers shaping the dynamic evolution of each scenario, we identified that organisations need to pay different levels of attention to the components of structural, human and relational capital in order to optimise value generation in each scenario. The first scenario looks at the natural evolution of the industrial economy paradigm as the pace of change accelerates and the expansion of the competitive environment increases the need for product innovation. The stimulus for this innovation is the quality and motivation of the people employed. Human capital management is the main lever to optimise organisational performance in this scenario. The next two scenarios look at organisations operating in the knowledge economy paradigm. One considers the consequences of continuing with the conventional psychological contract with employees based on a transactional exchange of money for time. A large investment is needed in the structural capital mechanisms to manage the organisational ownership of knowledge and to monitor and stimulate performance in delivering knowledge&#8209;based services. In the other scenario, the focus shifted to a situation where individuals and organisations negotiate common areas of interest before becoming involved together in something approaching a partnership. Learning and competitive agility emerge from networks of individuals and groups coalescing around shared objectives. Relationship capital becomes the basis of value generation.

Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to discuss the implementation of intellectual capital process to manage  the traditional knowledge of the community. This qualitative research was conducted through an exploratory method in co&#8209;operation with the Mea&#8209;hiya Community Cultural Council, Chiang Mai, Thailand. A four step&#8209; approach IC process was recommended; this was aimed at the successful acquisition of the proposed model. The research demonstrates the intellectual capital process model's usefulness. Not only does the model encourage the community to formulate strategies from the stakeholders, but it also puts the strategy in practice because it is grounded in the stakeholders' needs and expectations. The process is more quantifiable by having key success factors' indicators measuring the traditional knowledge capital. The discussion leads to the formulation of a defensive protection system. The outcome of the community's traditional knowledge leans toward a local community&#8209;based organizational paradigm. Consequently, the Mea&#8209;hiya community pointed out the strategy to conserve and protect traditional knowledge by creating a defensive protection system which is incompliance to the WIPO & UNESCO framework (conserve, transmit, and protect of traditional knowledge). This paper allows practitioners to reflect on a case for implementing an IC process to manage cultural traditional knowledge.

Design of Sustainable Development: Intellectual Value of Large BRIC Companies and Factors of their Growth
Pages:
pp535&#8209;558
Authors:
Elvina Bayburina
Tatiana Golovko
Abstract:
Intellectual capital and its components can be regarded as the source for a company's organic growth to maintain sustainable development. Under the crisis conditions most of financial reserves are unavailable; the inner organizational efficiency by means of intellectual capital is a question of survival edge for most of the large companies of emerging markets. Multidirectional trends of the development of BRIC economies played a significant role in this discussion and the issue became more complicated under the pressure of the crisis.  Notwithstanding BRIC countries can be regarded as leaders of so&#8209;called developing economies. In terms of the downturn, however, the problem of the crisis should not be overstated: due to the cyclical changes of the world economy the stagnation will be rearranged by upturn sooner or later, however the accumulation of intellectual capital is the over time process. Intellectual capital of the company and its components can be regarded as "latent reserves" of the long term value growth. Intellectual capital is the "intangible safety&#8209;cushion" and it can be used only by those companies who have created it years before and therefore have focused on sustainable development. The research of intellectual capital components and its role in value creation and building competitive advantage can remain an actual topic for empirical investigations, carried out in various countries and by different research centers. The intellectual value of a company is a part of the total value, created through the process of the intellectual components' accumulation. The main goal of this research is to evaluate by means of the panel data analysis the influence of particular components of intellectual capital on the intellectual value of BRIC companies. The process of intellectual capital accumulation is over time and it can be measured according to the long run panel data analysis not less than 5 years. The panel data analysis revealed that the human capital can be considered the key factor of the long&#8209;term growth of BRIC companies of all industries. Employees and their competencies are this basis which is undervalued currently whereas most of financial assets lost trust and its value. However, specified directions of internal reserves audit and discussion of the Intellectual value on the emerging markets are very close to the fact that large BRIC companies depend a lot on the specific features of the infrastructure of each developing country. India and Russia are countries with the industrial potential, which is not fully realized, e.g. a lot of Russian companies are underinvested with unbalanced development strategies.  Decrepit and out&#8209;of&#8209;date production facilities, in turn capital expenditures are a matter of great importance. The capital expenditures together with innovative managers and management techniques tend to be the leverage, which can push these companies towards intensive development, especially Russian companies.

Abstract:
This paper reports on data collected over time on intellectual capital levels in three high&#8209;tech industries. Data are also presented on competitive intelligence activity in the same industries. These data shed light on the idea that knowledge management is more strategic than is commonly portrayed, with the level of development and sharing of knowledge depending on circumstances at the national, industry, and firm level.  Similarly, competitive intelligence offense and defense also vary according to environment. Given the evidence here that knowledge assets vary widely by industry and by firm, as do competitive intelligence efforts, organizations should scan their environments and adopt knowledge strategies appropriate to their circumstances.

What is the Value of Knowledge Management Practices?

Authors:

Vivien Reid
Abstract:
What are the appropriate sources from which to draw evidence about Knowledge Management (KM) and its added value to organisations? This paper attempts to answer this question, first examining the literature for approaches to measuring KM from the perspective of Intellectual Capital (IC) theory. However, findings indicated that many measurement methods or frameworks have limitations. Following the literature review, the researchers then approached KM practitioners, within the UK car manufacturing industry, and undertook in&#8209;depth interviews in an attempt to understand how these organisations value their KM practices. The UK car manufacturing industry was selected because little previous research has been undertaken in this context, most previous studies having concentrated mainly on service industries. It was discovered that, in most of the organisations studied, the link between KM, business benefits and bottom line is almost axiomatic, especially amongst those who are enthusiastic advocates of KM. Drawing on the evidence from the in&#8209;depth interviews, the paper concludes that there is an absence of linking mechanisms between value and measurement. This is due to the differences between the concept of a value and measurement approach and the importance of these two concepts to justify the outcome of KM practices. Recommendations are made through the development of a theoretical framework that includes both objective and subjective dimensions of KM measurement strategy.

Abstract:
In a rapidly changing world evidenced by a transition from industrial to knowledge economy, India's progressing knowledge sector has attracted the attention of the entire globe. The future drivers of any economy will no longer be capital, land or equipment; but the people and their knowledge. Indian corporate sector, now, is in search of a new paradigm in accounting, which would enable it to record its new journey from financial capital to intellectual capital. With this background in mind, the study of 15 leading Indian Information Technology companies, considered to be highly knowledge intensive, is undertaken in order to find out the disclosure level of recording and reporting of intellectual capital by these companies. An effort has been made in this paper to identify the meaning and significance of intellectual capital and to evaluate the prevailing practices of recording and reporting of intellectual capital by the Information Technology sector in India by using the content analysis method. The results of the study demonstrate that intellectual capital reporting in the Indian Information Technology companies are almost negligible and it is evident that intellectual capital reporting has not received any preference or priority for the mentors of the Indian corporations.

Title:
Evaluating Knowledge Management Performance
Pages:
pp583&#8209;592
Authors:
Clemente Minonneand Geoff Turner
Abstract:
As organisations become increasingly aware that knowledge is among their most valuable strategic assets, they will be forced to re&#8209;evaluate the way in which they engage with the source of that knowledge to underpin their sustainable development. This will create a fundamental change to established practice; a change that results in a paradigm shift from the traditional operational approach to a more strategic involvement in knowledge management. This change is promoted by the knowledge management maturity model (KM3). KM3 is founded on the idea that successful knowledge management comprises four forms of integration, namely cultural, organisational, procedural and methodical. Despite an emphasis on one of these forms by many organisations, it is understood that all forms of KM integration should be considered in parallel to implement knowledge management practices in an integrative manner. Key indicators that measure the performance of knowledge management integration are needed. They need to measure both effectiveness and efficiency. In many cases, organisations having, and actively executing, a knowledge management strategy tend to focus on the efficiency dimension because it can be evaluated more easily than the effectiveness dimension. Yet this path is fraught with danger because, as with many other aspects of business, the management of knowledge has to be effective before it may provide efficiency gains. Nevertheless, organisations require appropriate forms of measurement. Those that are unwilling, or unable, to develop effective measuring and reporting systems are likely to suffer from product or service quality decreases, lower productivity growth and a reduced ability to compete because they will be less successful in acquiring and using relevant knowledge resources. Key performance indicators that are developed to assess the progress of organisations in this compelling activity need to be aligned with one or another of the four forms of integration and may be either qualitative or quantitative in nature. The balanced scorecard concept is used to measure performance of the KM3 where the balance between the four forms of integration is the prime consideration. Each of these is represented by one segment of the knowledge management monitor (KM2) to facilitate a better understanding of the cause&#8209;and&#8209;effect relationships. It does so by providing structured information about an organisation's knowledge resources: how they are nurtured and how they contribute to organisational sustainability. At the same time, use of KM2 is related to organisational economy. Good economy means good resource management, which for many organisations translates to how they manage individual and accumulated organisational knowledge. This has become so important that they are looking for a more integrated way of managing the three interdependent and complementary pillars of knowledge management, which are organisational learning management, organisational knowledge management and intellectual capital management. Although these three concepts lack a unifying vision, they all relate to each other by informing one another and provide the pathway for a knowledge&#8209;based orientation of strategic management.

Abstract:
The implementation of Knowledge Management (KM) processes has been long overlooked in the KM literature. This paper describes and analyzes the implementation of a KM process within the Brazilian organizational context based on a theoretical framework entitled "The SET KM Model". Both propositions â€” a process design for KM Implementation and "The SET KM Model"&#8209; came out as results of different sets of studies and researches conducted by two of the authors within the past decade. The methodology, qualitative in nature, is based on the study of multiple cases with incorporated units of analysis and three criteria were observed for the judgment of the quality of the research project: validity of the construct, external validity and reliability. Multiple sources of evidence were used â€” semi&#8209;structured interviews, extensive documental research, direct observation and participant observation â€” and data analysis consisted of three flows of activities: data reduction, data displays and conclusion drawingverification. Among others, the case study conducted at ONS is highlighted in order to discuss a successful implementation experience in its early stages. The results confirmed the frameworks proposed and the conclusions suggest that (i) within KM, what is managed it's not knowledge itself, but solely the context where knowledge emerges and is socially constructed (ba) and (ii) KM implementation processes should be developed around strategic organizational issues and involve key knowledge activists in the organizations, mainly middle&#8209;managers composing a governance committee supported by top administration.

Let's Learn Unlearning: How Top Managers Conceive and Implement Knowledge Active Forgetting

Abstract:
Regarding the influential role of top managers in the process of unlearning, the main question in this paper is "how top managers understand and approach unlearning" in their managerial activities. Toward this aim, based on several case studies with top managers who have recently been involved in the process of knowledge based changes, we realized that top managers are more apt to focus on technical and concrete types of knowledge such as knowledge which resides in systems and procedures. Moreover, among all different possible approaches toward unlearning, they mainly make sense of this it as a process of "pushing by new knowledge", and "abandoning old knowledge" that both of them are radical approaches toward unlearning. The main lesson drawn in this study is that researchers who interact with managers in their inquiry about unlearning must be aware about the natural orientations of top managers and how this might affect the validity of their field inquiry. Above all, the insights gained in this study shows that field study about unlearning based on the opinions of managers is easy to start with, as managers can make sense about this process easily, but is difficult to focus on, because managers easily shift from unlearning old knowledge to learning new knowledge in their thoughts.

Perceptions on Complexity of Decisions Involved in Choosing Intellectual Capital Assessment Methods

Abstract:
Intellectual capital (IC) is increasingly acknowledged as a dominant strategic asset and a major source of competitive advantage for organisations. Despite an overwhelming body of literature on methods, models, systems and frameworks for assessment of IC, and increased awareness of the need for such assessment, relatively few organisations are actively and comprehensively assessing their IC. Choosing an appropriate method is problematic. It has been argued that, due to the complexities involved in choosing (selecting and customising) an appropriate method for assessing intellectual capital in a particular context, management support systems with knowledge components are needed for managing the evolving body of knowledge concerning the assessment of intellectual capital. To empirically test this argument, a survey making use of a self&#8209;administered questionnaire was performed to test perceptions of suitable consultants, practitioners and researchers on the complexity levels of decisions to be made in selecting and customising methods for assessment of IC. Respondents were selected through convenience sampling coupled with snowball sampling. Data collected on respondents themselves confirms their expert status regarding IC and aspects thereof. The majority of these respondents indicated that, given any particular context, the decisions involved in selecting and customising an appropriate method for assessment of IC is often or always very complex. Decisions involved in selection are perceived as marginally more complex than decisions involved in customisation. Respondents provided valuable insights and rich examples of scenarios on the higher and lower regions of the complexity scale for the decisions involved in the selection, as well as, for the decisions involved in the customisation of IC assessment methods. It is concluded that the perceived complexity of the decisions involved in choosing IC assessment methods supports the notion that supporting systems are required to assist human decision makers in making sense of the complexities involved in choosing IC assessment methods.

Abstract:
This study aims to explain the theoretical aspect of KM in order to construct a new undergraduate program. Knowledge management as a discipline plays a crucial role at the undergraduate level in universities. Firstly, it is needed to create a common terminology from which the scholars can establish programs. Secondly, a set of sciences are needed. These two stages will allow us to redefine the knowledge management discipline from an interdisciplinary perspective that is based on four fundamental paradigms: (1) technological, (2) socio technical, (3) inter  intra organizational and (4) humanist paradigm. This will allow us to have an opportunity to improve the common terms, which we can establish the knowledge management undergraduate programs from. In addition, the practical perspective of this study will be tested in Turkish universities, which have knowledge management undergraduate programs, which will enable us to suggest a new sample for how knowledge management undergraduate degree programs should successfully be constructed in Turkey.

Abstract:
A key prerequisite for effective team collaboration concerns the team members' knowledge about their different backgrounds, skills and experiences. While face&#8209;to&#8209;face interaction provides multiple opportunities for learning about these vital personal elements informally, a computer&#8209;mediated communication setting may make knowledge sharing about team members and their specific backgrounds more difficult. This knowledge sharing, however, may be crucial and should thus be supported also in remote settings. In this paper, we present the design and results of a controlled experiment in which participants needed to share information and make decisions with team members online, in a simulated project kick&#8209;off meeting. Five experimental groups collaborated in a three&#8209;dimensional Virtual Environment (3D CVE), five control groups in text chat sessions. Opposing these two media, we were able to extrapolate the essential characteristics of 3D CVE. The experiment yields first results proving improved retention when collaborating with avatars in 3D environments and provides insights about the value of this media as a collaboration tool.

Activities and Outputs of a Clinical Faculty: an Intellectual Capital Concept Map

Abstract:
The concept of intellectual capital (IC) was used to evaluate the activities and outputs of a university medical department. First, a conceptual framework was developed to highlight the importance of various activities as dimensions of IC. The conceptualization of IC was further developed using concept mapping (CM). The authors first considered the problem of what comprises IC and determined whether previous researchers have defined IC in terms of activities. The importance of IC, its definition as an organizational resource and activity, the link between IC and value creation and extraction activities, and the problem of the associated composition of IC taken from existing European guidelines and regulations were discussed. To begin to construct a classification of activities and outputs, the information currently employed for assessing the research, education, and related academic activities and outputs of faculty members were analyzed. Four different evaluation approaches were compared to identify the activities and outputs of a university medical department, and to consolidate the information being collected for evaluation of universities, university&#8209;affiliated research institutes, researchers within universities, and faculty within university departments into an inclusive set of activities and outputs. These were two forms of IC reporting, one used in Austrian universities and the other at a university&#8209;affiliated Swedish research institute together with two other long&#8209;established means of assessing faculty, the Research Assessment Exercise in the UK, and the faculty evaluation and promotion requirements at the University of Toronto in Canada. Education administrators' perceptions were solicited to derive the IC used in a research faculty of a Canadian university. The results indicate that IC can be understood in terms of both activities and outputs. Clinical faculty can be expected to engage in research and its supervision, education, obtaining qualifications, clinical and professional practice, and service. Within these categories, individual activities and outputs were not considered to be of equal importance or impact. Among seventy activities and outputs, articles in internationally refereed journals was ranked as most important, whereas teaching awards was ranked as having the most impact by the most participants. This study extends existing research by using CM to generate a conceptual framework of IC for a department of medicine.

Linking Unlearning with Innovation through Organizational Memory and Technology
Pages:
pp1&#8209;10
Authors:
Juan-Gabriel Cegarra-Navarro
Abstract:
While the information technologies provide organizational members with explicit concepts, such as writing instruction manuals, the 'organizational memory' provides individuals with tacit knowledge, such as systematic sets, routines and shared visions. This means that individuals within an organization learn by using both the organizational memory and the information technologies. They interact to reduce organizational information needs contributing to improve organizational innovativeness. However, the utilization of the organization memory or the technology infrastructure does not guarantee that appropriate information is used in appropriate circumstances or that information is appropriately updated. In other words, previous memories reflect a world that is only partially understood and assimilated, which might lead individuals to doing the wrong things right or the right things wrong. This paper examines the relative importance and significance of the existence of unlearning to the presence and nature of 'organizational memory and technology'. We further examine the effect of the existence of organizational memory and information technology on conditions that promote organizational innovativeness. These relationships are examined through an empirical investigation of 291 large Spanish companies. Our analysis found that if the organization considers the establishment of an unlearning culture as a prior step in the utilization of organization memory or the technology infrastructure through organizational innovativeness, then organization memory and technology have a positive influence on the conditions that stimulate organizational innovativeness.

Virtual Communities of Practice: Investigating Motivations and Constraints in the Processes of Knowledge Creation and Transfer
Pages:
pp11&#8209;20
Authors:
Ana Maria Ramalho Correia
Abstract:
With accelerated market volatility, faster response times and increased globalization, business environments are going through a major transformation and firms have intensified their search for strategies which can give them competitive advantage. This requires that companies continuously innovate, to think of new ideas that can be transformed into products, processes or services, generating value for the firm. Innovative solutions and processes are usually developed by a group of people, working together. A grouping of people that share and create new knowledge can be considered as a Community of Practice (CoP). CoPs are places which provide a sound basis for organizational learning and encourage knowledge creation and acquisition. Virtual Communities of Practice (VCoPs) can perform a central role in promoting communication and collaboration between members who are dispersed in both time and space. Nevertheless, it is known that not all CoPs and VCoPs share the same levels of performance or produce the same results. This means that there are factors that enable or constrain the process of knowledge creation. With this in mind, we developed a case study in order to identify both the motivations and the constraints that members of an organization experience when taking part in the knowledge creating processes of VCoPs. Results show that organizational culture and professional and personal development play important roles in these processes. No interviewee mentioned direct financial reward as a motivation factor for participation in VCoPs. Most identified the difficulty in aligning objectives, established by the management, with justification of the time spent in the VCoP. The interviewees also said that technology is not a constraint.

Organizing Customer Knowledge in Academic Libraries

pp21&#8209;32
Authors:
Farhad Daneshgar
Lyn Bosanquet
Abstract:
Availability of sophisticated ICT infrastructure combined with emerging business processes such as various service orientation configurations, constitute major characteristics of many of today's libraries in western universities. This has created a vast amount of customer&#8209;related information in libraries. This article provides a methodology for organising customer knowledge in academic libraries. A two&#8209;dimensional Customer Knowledge Taxonomy (CKT) has been presented for organizing the customer knowledge, thus providing a formal and explicit specification to deliver a shared conceptualization of customer knowledge. Based on the proposed CKT, customer knowledge in academic libraries can be classified into (i) knowledge about customers, (ii) knowledge from customers and (iii) knowledge for customers. The knowledge in each of these three categories can be 'explicit' and 'tacit', thus providing six categories of customer knowledge. The second major contribution of this paper is to introduce a method for integrating the above first and second categories of customer knowledge in order to derive the third category. This integration methodology is based on an integrated cyclical knowledge flow model that consists of four phases including: (i) communication, (ii) knowledge sharing & dissemination, (iii) knowledge acquisition and application, and 'iv' knowledge utilization and evaluation. Through a qualitative research, the proposed framework, consisting of the CKT and the corresponding integrated cyclical knowledge flow model, was then applied to a large university library for coding and classifying the vast amounts of existing customer data residing in 2,500 interview scripts within the case study organization. In doing so, a uniform coding scheme had to be developed using a focus group methodology. Data were then stored into a customer knowledge base using the Laximancer software. The proposed framework was evaluated for consistency of conceptualisation to ensure reusability in similar environments. It is expected that similar organisations will benefit from the proposed methodology for classifying the customer knowledge in academic libraries and the associated evaluation methodology for design and development of integrated knowledge based systems which in turn will support emerging processes within the organization.

The Adoption of Knowledge Management Systems in Small Firms
Pages:
pp33&#8209;42
Authors:
Pietro Evangelista
Abstract:
Knowledge Management (KM) is a critical area for small business managers in today's competitive environment. However, there is a general consensus in relation to the fact that the benefits of KM have not been fully exploited by small firms. In fact, des[ite the wide literature on KM, there is an abundance of research describing how large companies are successfully practising KM, but little contributions on the critical success factors for KM adoption in SMEs. Indeed, empirical studies have been rarely conducted on this topic. The main aim of this paper is to shed light on the KM practices in small firms. To this purpose, the paper presents the preliminary results of an empirical investigation carried out in a cluster of 25 high&#8209;technology SMEs located in the eastern area of Naples City (Italy). The methodology adopted is based on the following two main stages: a) a literature review on knowledge management and its usage in small business has been carried out; b) a semi&#8209; structured questionnaire has been set up and validated in a number of focus group discussions. The questionnaire survey has been conducted through interviews with managers of small firms belonging to the cluster investigated. Survey findings highlight the following points: â€” the surveyed companies show significant KM needs, but they adopt mainly internal KMSs that involve relatively simple ICT tools; â€” knowledge exchanged is mainly tacit and it requires KM tools based on personal relationships and interactions such as work teams; â€” ENS firms express the need for both internal and external KMSs enabling collaborative relationships with other firms for developing common projects; â€” there are some relevant factors motivating the adoption of internal and external KMSs in firms investigated (such as innovation, operational management and market features) but also significant barriers (such as the protection of intellectual capital and cultural barriers).

Wikifailure: the Limitations of Technology for Knowledge Sharing

pp43&#8209;52
Authors:
Alexeis Garcia-Perez
Robert Ayres
Abstract:
Currently there is much interest in the use of Web 2.0 technologies to support knowledge sharing in organisations. Many successful projects have been reported. These reports emphasise how the use of such technology has unlocked new pathways for knowledge transfer. However, the limitations of Web 2.0 technologies are not yet well understood and potential difficulties may have been overlooked. This paper reports a case study of a Wiki which was implemented to support a group of researchers. Although belonging to the same institution, the group members were relatively dispersed and their research areas were disparate. Nevertheless a short study showed that there were benefits to be gained from sharing knowledge and that many of the researchers felt that a Wiki would be a good mechanism to support this. A Wiki was implemented and was initially very successful. A significant number of researchers contributed to the Wiki and almost all made use of it. However the usage declined over time and attempts to stimulate interest by providing incentives for contributions were unsuccessful. One year after launch use was minimal. A qualitative study was carried out to understand the reasons for this decline in use, and is reported in this paper. Responses suggest that two factors may have been particularly significant in explaining the failure of the system. One problem appears to have been a lack of critical mass. Only a small proportion of users are likely to contribute and there may be a threshold size for a community to be able to support a vibrant Wiki. Time also seems to have been an issue. Some respondents said that they simply were too busy to contribute to or use the system. Organisations which are considering the use of Web 2.0 technologies to support a knowledge management initiative should consider the likely impact of these factors in their own situation. Although technologies such as Wiki have great potential there are also pitfalls in undertaking such projects which are not yet well understood.

Limitations of Network Analysis for Studying Efficiency and Effectiveness of Knowledge Sharing

Abstract:
Knowledge sharing is an important part of an employee's tasks as it is one of the mechanisms through which they learn and innovate. Sharing of knowledge typically occurs in the informal networks in the organization by means of social interaction. Several authors have proposed to use social network analysis to study the knowledge sharing relations in organizations to identify potential barriers concerning knowledge sharing. Although social network analysis has been applied in several cases, it has not been evaluated if this approach results in reliable results in terms of findings problems related to knowledge sharing. One might for instance find an isolated person with network analysis, but given the context this might not be necessary a problem. The goal of this research is to validate the use of social network analysis to study knowledge networks. We have selected one particular technique, called Knowledge Network Analysis, to evaluate in this research. The Knowledge Network Analysis technique has been applied in a case study at an international product software developer to find potential barriers in their knowledge networks. To evaluate these results, a qualitative analysis has been executed afterwards by a different researcher. This analysis was based on interviews, document study and observations. To analyze the qualitative data we developed a new model called Knowledge Sharing Environment Model (KSEM), which identifies knowledge sharing bottlenecks in a structured manner. The results from network analysis and the qualitative analysis have been compared to validate the outcomes of the network analysis. Hence, six out of nine bottlenecks were validated. This research demonstrates that Knowledge Network Analysis is a good tool for the identification of bottlenecks but needs further validation in additional case studies. However, it was suggested to combine the Knowledge Network Analysis technique with another method such as the KSEM to validate and study the causes behind the identified bottlenecks.

Exploring Knowledge Work Practices and Evolution in Distributed Networks of Practice
Pages:
pp69&#8209;78
Authors:
Eli Hustad
Abstract:
This paper derives from a longitudinal study conducted in a multinational company. Through an interpretive case study approach, we have explored the phenomenon of knowledge networking in distributed work. More specifically, we have focused on the evolution patterns in a particular knowledge networking structure denoted as distributed networks of practice. The paper conceptualizes this kind of network of practice as an information and communication technology (ICT) facilitated dynamic relationship of participants that are geographically and temporally dispersed from one another, and who are sharing and creating knowledge related to their daily work practices and business problems. Three different categories of networks were identified 1) problem solving networks, 2) business improvement networks, and 3) innovation networks. Findings demonstrate that the networks evolved differently over time, and the study identified four distinct evolution patterns comprising 1) devolution in terms of short life cycle and dissolution, 2) recursive patterns where new ad&#8209;hoc networks emerged from the mother network, 3) integration of knowledge practices through cross&#8209;network proposals, and 4) innovation and expansion in scope and size. While previous studies have suggested fixed models for how a life cycle of a community takes place, this study however identified four dissimilar evolution patterns. Thus, these findings challenge life cycles models suggested in traditional community of practice research. The paper utilizes an information infrastructure perspective to provide an improved understanding of the evolution patterns within these networks by viewing them as ecological social structures facilitated by a technological infrastructure.  Through social lines of practice and effective knowledge sharing, the participants created an infrastructure of knowing within the organization and managed to alter organizational practices through evolution. The paper illustrates how a knowledge networking structure as such may facilitate distributed work practices and knowledge activities across temporal and spatial boundaries.

Abstract:
It is widely accepted that knowledge management is a critical success factor for enterprises. Not yet known sufficiently are the factors, which influence the success of knowledge management in order to measure the effectiveness of knowledge management. This paper sets out a quantitative study to investigate these factors. Firstly, an overview of empirical work undertaken and the potential success factors is given. After this, the methodology of the study is described. Thereby the basics of structure equation modelling (SEM) are shown. The difference between structure and measurement model is depicted and different validity measures are described. Also two common and possible methods to evaluate a SEM, the co&#8209;variance analysis and the variance analysis are displayed. Thirdly a specific model is presented to use SEM in the context of knowledge management success. The model is based on the theory of planned behaviour and is adapted to the context of knowledge management success. Thereby knowledge management success is seen on an individual level, which means that successful knowledge management leads to a satisfying knowledge supply of the organisation member. Finally limitations of the work are discussed.

A Framework for Assessing Commensurability of Semantic Web Ontologies
Pages:
pp91&#8209;102
Authors:
Liam Magee
Abstract:
The Semantic Web proposes a framework for establishing a "web of data", analogous to the "web of documents" of the World Wide Web. It envisions a series of interconnected ontologies, underwritten by formal languages such as OWL and RDF. The problem of co&#8209;ordinating disparate ontologies has led to the development of various ontology matching approaches. However, as these approaches are algorithmic they cannot make use of background or tacit information about the ontologies they examine â€” information only available in the broader social context in which ontologies are created and used. In many practical knowledge management scenarios, such information is vital in understanding the costs, feasibility and scope of ontology alignment projects. Prior to undertaking the detailed task of concept&#8209;to&#8209;concept mapping between two ontologies, it is therefore useful to ask: are these ontologies broadly commensurable? This paper presents a framework for describing and comparing cultural information about ontologies, developed as part of a joint project conducted by RMIT University and FujiXerox Australia, "Towards the 'Semantic Web': Standards and Interoperability across Document Management and Publishing Supply Chains". The framework is intended for practitioners to use as a tool to arrive at better estimates and assessments of the scope of work required to develop an adequate translation between two or more ontologies. The framework has been piloted as an online software toolkit, which is presented to a small group of participants. After using the software, participants complete an evaluation, which elicits quantitative and qualitative feedback on both the framework and the software. The paper presents the results of the pilot testing process, along with some considerations of how the framework might be further improved.

With the emergence of the knowledge intensive industry, where organisations rely on the knowledge of their staff for competitive advantage (Lustri et al., 2007), KM has become key for business success (Mu&#8209;jung et al., 2007). KM, once seen as a fad (Ramsey, 1996) is now an integral business function (Zhou and Fink, 2003) in both traditional and internet&#8209;based businesses (Borges Tiago et al., 2007) to the extent that KM is now viewed essential for profit (Yang, 2008). Despite the great progress made in KM over the past decade (Omega Editorial, 2009) much confusion exists around the practical implementation of knowledge&#8209;orientated programmes, resulting in either an overemphasis on technology to the exclusion of adequate peoplequality planning, or, strong peoplequality programmes from a knowledge perspective, hindered by inadequate enabling technologies. For example, organisations question how current KM models, frameworks and programmes can be applied across all organisations uniformly? If changes are necessary to the approach adopted by an organisation, what are these changes and are the drivers behind the change approaches largely implementation modifications or are there more fundamental issues to be resolved? Are the most important issues (King, 2007) being addressed? How is KM success defined? (Jennex and Croasdell, 2007) Considering the large investment capital expended by many firms in KM systems (Curley, 1998) and the growing number of companies that see KM as potentially helping them survive and compete, there is a need for more definitive and comprehensive studies in this field for systematic empirical research and in&#8209;depth rich case studies. This paper presents results of empirical research undertaken in early 2009 with 588 UK companies. Research purpose is to assess the impact of the MeCTIP model [Moffett, 2000; Moffett et al., 2002, 2003] on UK companies to identify key factors for successful implementation, practice and development of KM. The research employs the 'Benchmarking KM' online survey tool. This paper focuses on research methodology and initial survey results using statistical analysis techniques such as descriptives and factor analysis. Avenues for further research are identified.

Functional Concept for a Web&#8209;Based Knowledge Impact and IC Reporting Portal

Abstract:
Knowledge and Intellectual Capital (IC) are key resources and crucial fields of investment in today's business organisations and the economy. Problems in strategically and effectively using those resources mainly consist in: (i) how to specify, summarize, visualize the current state of knowledge and IC; (ii) how to comfortably provide access to scattered and ill&#8209;structured information on the current state of knowledge and IC; (iii) how to define, understand, visualize the impact of knowledge on organizational performance and of IC on the economy; (iv) how to assess and evaluate strategies and activities for purposefully intervening in organizations and economies by means of knowledge and IC. To overcome this, the paper presents methods, functionality and tools forming a web&#8209;based infrastructure which provides user&#8209;friendly access to information and understanding of knowledge impacts and IC market at company, sector, national and global levels. This infrastructure basically consists of two sections. The first section enables us to immediately benchmark a company's knowledge management maturity according to specific input data and information, provide tailored feedback and suggest changes in the company's strategy concerning knowledge&#8209;related activities. With this, companies should be motivated to provide their data and support continuous testing, evaluation and improvement of all methods, models, measures and benchmarks following an experimental design. The second section consists of a "World Atlas on Intellectual Capital" comprising world&#8209;wide data on the following constituents of the IC market: demand, supply, equilibrium, investment, need, stock, flow, and returns. With this, the web&#8209;based knowledge impact and IC reporting portal will support decision makers at company and political levels to purposefully intervene on the attitude towards knowledge and IC through guidelines. Consequently, the paper contributes to research and development to measure and with this to develop a better understanding of the impact of knowledge (management) and IC on the delivery of effective business processes and high value services.

Title:
Evaluating a Living Model of Knowledge

Abstract:
The definition of knowledge has always been a contentious issue in knowledge management. Effective knowledge management requires a definition of knowledge that is consistent, useful and true. Whilst most definitions today fulfil the first two criteria, none accurately address all three, including the true, biological nature of knowledge. This is where autopoiesis can help. Autopoiesis was developed to try to answer the question of what makes something living, using a scientific methodology. It proposes living things are discrete, self&#8209;producing entities and constantly cognising entities. Autopoiesis has long inspired definitions of knowledge, with ideas such as: knowledge cannot be transferred, or knowledge can only be created by the potential 'knower'. Using the theory of autopoiesis, it is possible to create a biologically grounded model of knowledge, representing the latest thinking in neuroscience. However, before this new, biologically grounded model of knowledge can be integrated into new or existing knowledge management theories, it needs to be tested, else it falls into the trap of being conceptual, and remaining that way. This paper starts with the autopoietic, and therefore biologically, grounded model of knowledge, and develops the new evaluation framework necessary to test the model. The evaluation methodology developed in this research started from the field of programme evaluation and was adapted to meet the needs of the knowledge management discipline. This paper subsequently presents the initial findings from the evaluation process and takes the first steps to identifying how knowledge management can improve with its newly found scientific grounding.

People, Technology, Processes and Risk Knowledge Sharing

Authors:

Abstract:
The present global economic crisis creates doubts about the good use of accumulated experience and knowledge in managing risk in financial services. Typically, risk management practice does not use knowledge management (KM) to improve and to develop new answers to the threats. A key reason is that it is not clear how to break down the "organizational silos" view of risk management (RM) that is commonly taken. As a result, there has been relatively little work on finding the relationships between RM and KM. We have been doing research for the last couple of years on the identification of relationships between these two disciplines. At ECKM 2007 we presented a general review of the literature(s) and some hypotheses for starting research on KM and its relationship to the perceived value of enterprise risk management. This article presents findings based on our preliminary analyses, concentrating on those factors affecting the perceived quality of risk knowledge sharing. These come from a questionnaire survey of RM employees in organisations in the financial services sector, which yielded 121 responses. We have included five explanatory variables for the perceived quality of risk knowledge sharing. These comprised two variables relating to people (organizational capacity for work coordination and perceived quality of communication among groups), one relating to process (perceived quality of risk control) and two related to technology (web channel functionality and RM information system functionality).  Our findings so far are that four of these five variables have a significant positive association with the perceived quality of risk knowledge sharing: contrary to expectations, web channel functionality did not have a significant association. Indeed, in some of our exploratory regression studies its coefficient (although not significant) was negative. In stepwise regression, the variable organizational capacity for work coordination accounted for by far the largest part of the variation in the dependent variable perceived quality of risk knowledge sharing. The "people" variables thus appear to have the greatest influence on the perceived quality of risk knowledge sharing, even in a sector that relies heavily on technology and on quantitative approaches to decision making. We have also found similar results with the dependent variable perceived value of Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) implementation.

Knowledge&#8209;Based Strategies for Knowledge Intensive Business Services: a Multiple Case&#8209;study of Computer Service Companies
Pages:
pp151&#8209;160
Authors:
Enrico Scarso
Ettore Bolisani
Abstract:
While knowledge is increasingly considered to be a key resource for companies, the models for formulating business strategies that explicitly include it as a core component are still lacking. The paper investigates such issues by considering the particular case of computer service companies, which can be seen as Knowledge Intensive Business Services (KIBS) firms connecting the sources of innovation (i.e. large multinationals, research laboratories, universities, etc.) to the individual needs of the local customers. In doing so they operate as mediators between the local cognitive requirements and the more generic knowledge available in the global environment. Since those companies base their competitiveness on the capability to manage knowledge flows among various actors, the formulation of their business strategies requires new approaches that directly focus on knowledge assets and relevant processes. The paper describes the results of a survey involving twenty&#8209;one computer service companies located in the Northeast of Italy. The study allows the user to draw useful schemes for the identification of knowledge&#8209;based strategies, which can be of use beyond the specific context of investigation. In particular, rather than proposing completely new models for knowledge&#8209;based strategic formulations, the paper analyses the way knowledge can be integrated into more traditional strategic frameworks. The assumption is that these approaches can be more comfortable and understandable by the management of companies whose business is strongly based on knowledge but don't have deliberate knowledge management strategies.

Measuring the Effects of Knowledge Management Practices
Pages:
pp161&#8209;170
Authors:

Clemente Minonne
Abstract:
Successful managers focus their attention on factors that are critical in establishing and maintaining an organisation's competitive edge. The knowledge and skill of employees is one of those factors and it requires proactive management attention. Conceptually, this is achieved through Knowledge Management, a term that has existed in the mainstream of business lexicon for quite some time. Despite this, there is the conspicuous absence of a common understanding of the term that frustrates many managers. Studies have clearly established that there are three interdependent and complementary pillars that support the concept of Knowledge Management. These are Organisational Learning Management (OLM), Organisational Knowledge Management (OKM) and Intellectual Capital Management (ICM). OLM, which has so far dominated both academic and practitioner debate, concerns itself with the problem of capturing, organising and retrieving explicit knowledge, or information, and has led to the simplistic misconception that Knowledge Management only involves the capture, or downloading, of the content of employees' minds. ICM is dominated by those particularly interested in defining key performance indicators that will measure the impact and the benefits of applying knowledge management practices. If management requires measurement this is an essential task but it can only be undertaken once an organisation has clearly established the strategy&#8209;structure&#8209;process parameters to ensure it accesses, creates and embeds the knowledge that it needs...the OKM pillar of knowledge management. This paper looks more deeply at this pillar and in particular the lack of a general integrative approach to enhancing organisational performance in this key strategic area. It considers to what extent such an approach may help an organisation more effectively manage its most relevant source of competitive advantage. With a greater awareness of the various factors allied to the managing and leveraging of human oriented and system oriented knowledge assets, some proposals are put forward to assist in developing or redefining an organisation's intellectual capital reporting models in search of a planning, control and performance measurement system that accounts for the management of an organisation's intellectual assets.

Abstract:
During the last decade, the Thai government has recognized that Thailand needs to move toward an economy not only based on the cheapness of labour but also based on its intellectual capital and innovation capability. Therefore, the country has set up initiatives and specific policy to attract multinational corporations that could contribute to raise the research and development capacity of the country. Several studies have been undertaken to evaluate the role that Multinational corporations could play in knowledge creation, technology diffusion and development of potential R&D within South East Asia. Amongst the several approaches investigating the factors fostering Innovation in developing countries, one strategy would be to strength the Universities&#8209;Industries (UI) relationship. The success and failure of the University&#8209;Industry linkage has been widely discussed, but there is still a need to understand the dimensions impacting on the willingness of multinational corporations to share knowledge with Thai Universities. This paper discusses the balance of factors (industrial characteristics, firm characteristics and business models) that can play a substantial role in enhancing the knowledge sharing mechanisms.

Linking Unlearning with Innovation through Organizational Memory and Technology
Pages:
pp1&#8209;10
Authors:
Juan-Gabriel Cegarra-Navarro
Abstract:
While the information technologies provide organizational members with explicit concepts, such as writing instruction manuals, the 'organizational memory' provides individuals with tacit knowledge, such as systematic sets, routines and shared visions. This means that individuals within an organization learn by using both the organizational memory and the information technologies. They interact to reduce organizational information needs contributing to improve organizational innovativeness. However, the utilization of the organization memory or the technology infrastructure does not guarantee that appropriate information is used in appropriate circumstances or that information is appropriately updated. In other words, previous memories reflect a world that is only partially understood and assimilated, which might lead individuals to doing the wrong things right or the right things wrong. This paper examines the relative importance and significance of the existence of unlearning to the presence and nature of 'organizational memory and technology'. We further examine the effect of the existence of organizational memory and information technology on conditions that promote organizational innovativeness. These relationships are examined through an empirical investigation of 291 large Spanish companies. Our analysis found that if the organization considers the establishment of an unlearning culture as a prior step in the utilization of organization memory or the technology infrastructure through organizational innovativeness, then organization memory and technology have a positive influence on the conditions that stimulate organizational innovativeness.

Virtual Communities of Practice: Investigating Motivations and Constraints in the Processes of Knowledge Creation and Transfer
Pages:
pp11&#8209;20
Authors:
Ana Maria Ramalho Correia
Abstract:
With accelerated market volatility, faster response times and increased globalization, business environments are going through a major transformation and firms have intensified their search for strategies which can give them competitive advantage. This requires that companies continuously innovate, to think of new ideas that can be transformed into products, processes or services, generating value for the firm. Innovative solutions and processes are usually developed by a group of people, working together. A grouping of people that share and create new knowledge can be considered as a Community of Practice (CoP). CoPs are places which provide a sound basis for organizational learning and encourage knowledge creation and acquisition. Virtual Communities of Practice (VCoPs) can perform a central role in promoting communication and collaboration between members who are dispersed in both time and space. Nevertheless, it is known that not all CoPs and VCoPs share the same levels of performance or produce the same results. This means that there are factors that enable or constrain the process of knowledge creation. With this in mind, we developed a case study in order to identify both the motivations and the constraints that members of an organization experience when taking part in the knowledge creating processes of VCoPs. Results show that organizational culture and professional and personal development play important roles in these processes. No interviewee mentioned direct financial reward as a motivation factor for participation in VCoPs. Most identified the difficulty in aligning objectives, established by the management, with justification of the time spent in the VCoP. The interviewees also said that technology is not a constraint.

Organizing Customer Knowledge in Academic Libraries
Pages:
pp21&#8209;32
Authors:
Farhad Daneshgar
Lyn Bosanquet
Abstract:
Availability of sophisticated ICT infrastructure combined with emerging business processes such as various service orientation configurations, constitute major characteristics of many of today's libraries in western universities. This has created a vast amount of customer&#8209;related information in libraries. This article provides a methodology for organising customer knowledge in academic libraries. A two&#8209;dimensional Customer Knowledge Taxonomy (CKT) has been presented for organizing the customer knowledge, thus providing a formal and explicit specification to deliver a shared conceptualization of customer knowledge. Based on the proposed CKT, customer knowledge in academic libraries can be classified into (i) knowledge about customers, (ii) knowledge from customers and (iii) knowledge for customers. The knowledge in each of these three categories can be 'explicit' and 'tacit', thus providing six categories of customer knowledge. The second major contribution of this paper is to introduce a method for integrating the above first and second categories of customer knowledge in order to derive the third category. This integration methodology is based on an integrated cyclical knowledge flow model that consists of four phases including: (i) communication, (ii) knowledge sharing & dissemination, (iii) knowledge acquisition and application, and 'iv' knowledge utilization and evaluation. Through a qualitative research, the proposed framework, consisting of the CKT and the corresponding integrated cyclical knowledge flow model, was then applied to a large university library for coding and classifying the vast amounts of existing customer data residing in 2,500 interview scripts within the case study organization. In doing so, a uniform coding scheme had to be developed using a focus group methodology. Data were then stored into a customer knowledge base using the Laximancer software. The proposed framework was evaluated for consistency of conceptualisation to ensure reusability in similar environments. It is expected that similar organisations will benefit from the proposed methodology for classifying the customer knowledge in academic libraries and the associated evaluation methodology for design and development of integrated knowledge based systems which in turn will support emerging processes within the organization.

The Adoption of Knowledge Management Systems in Small Firms
Pages:
pp33&#8209;42
Authors:
Pietro Evangelista
Abstract:
Knowledge Management (KM) is a critical area for small business managers in today's competitive environment. However, there is a general consensus in relation to the fact that the benefits of KM have not been fully exploited by small firms. In fact, des[ite the wide literature on KM, there is an abundance of research describing how large companies are successfully practising KM, but little contributions on the critical success factors for KM adoption in SMEs. Indeed, empirical studies have been rarely conducted on this topic. The main aim of this paper is to shed light on the KM practices in small firms. To this purpose, the paper presents the preliminary results of an empirical investigation carried out in a cluster of 25 high&#8209;technology SMEs located in the eastern area of Naples City (Italy). The methodology adopted is based on the following two main stages: a) a literature review on knowledge management and its usage in small business has been carried out; b) a semi&#8209; structured questionnaire has been set up and validated in a number of focus group discussions. The questionnaire survey has been conducted through interviews with managers of small firms belonging to the cluster investigated. Survey findings highlight the following points: â€” the surveyed companies show significant KM needs, but they adopt mainly internal KMSs that involve relatively simple ICT tools; â€” knowledge exchanged is mainly tacit and it requires KM tools based on personal relationships and interactions such as work teams; â€” ENS firms express the need for both internal and external KMSs enabling collaborative relationships with other firms for developing common projects; â€” there are some relevant factors motivating the adoption of internal and external KMSs in firms investigated (such as innovation, operational management and market features) but also significant barriers (such as the protection of intellectual capital and cultural barriers).

Wikifailure: the Limitations of Technology for Knowledge Sharing

pp43&#8209;52
Authors:
Alexeis Garcia-Perez
Robert Ayres
Abstract:
Currently there is much interest in the use of Web 2.0 technologies to support knowledge sharing in organisations. Many successful projects have been reported. These reports emphasise how the use of such technology has unlocked new pathways for knowledge transfer. However, the limitations of Web 2.0 technologies are not yet well understood and potential difficulties may have been overlooked. This paper reports a case study of a Wiki which was implemented to support a group of researchers. Although belonging to the same institution, the group members were relatively dispersed and their research areas were disparate. Nevertheless a short study showed that there were benefits to be gained from sharing knowledge and that many of the researchers felt that a Wiki would be a good mechanism to support this. A Wiki was implemented and was initially very successful. A significant number of researchers contributed to the Wiki and almost all made use of it. However the usage declined over time and attempts to stimulate interest by providing incentives for contributions were unsuccessful. One year after launch use was minimal. A qualitative study was carried out to understand the reasons for this decline in use, and is reported in this paper. Responses suggest that two factors may have been particularly significant in explaining the failure of the system. One problem appears to have been a lack of critical mass. Only a small proportion of users are likely to contribute and there may be a threshold size for a community to be able to support a vibrant Wiki. Time also seems to have been an issue. Some respondents said that they simply were too busy to contribute to or use the system. Organisations which are considering the use of Web 2.0 technologies to support a knowledge management initiative should consider the likely impact of these factors in their own situation. Although technologies such as Wiki have great potential there are also pitfalls in undertaking such projects which are not yet well understood.

Limitations of Network Analysis for Studying Efficiency and Effectiveness of Knowledge Sharing

Abstract:
Knowledge sharing is an important part of an employee's tasks as it is one of the mechanisms through which they learn and innovate. Sharing of knowledge typically occurs in the informal networks in the organization by means of social interaction. Several authors have proposed to use social network analysis to study the knowledge sharing relations in organizations to identify potential barriers concerning knowledge sharing. Although social network analysis has been applied in several cases, it has not been evaluated if this approach results in reliable results in terms of findings problems related to knowledge sharing. One might for instance find an isolated person with network analysis, but given the context this might not be necessary a problem. The goal of this research is to validate the use of social network analysis to study knowledge networks. We have selected one particular technique, called Knowledge Network Analysis, to evaluate in this research. The Knowledge Network Analysis technique has been applied in a case study at an international product software developer to find potential barriers in their knowledge networks. To evaluate these results, a qualitative analysis has been executed afterwards by a different researcher. This analysis was based on interviews, document study and observations. To analyze the qualitative data we developed a new model called Knowledge Sharing Environment Model (KSEM), which identifies knowledge sharing bottlenecks in a structured manner. The results from network analysis and the qualitative analysis have been compared to validate the outcomes of the network analysis. Hence, six out of nine bottlenecks were validated. This research demonstrates that Knowledge Network Analysis is a good tool for the identification of bottlenecks but needs further validation in additional case studies. However, it was suggested to combine the Knowledge Network Analysis technique with another method such as the KSEM to validate and study the causes behind the identified bottlenecks.

Exploring Knowledge Work Practices and Evolution in Distributed Networks of Practice
Pages:
pp69&#8209;78
Authors:
Eli Hustad
Abstract:
This paper derives from a longitudinal study conducted in a multinational company. Through an interpretive case study approach, we have explored the phenomenon of knowledge networking in distributed work. More specifically, we have focused on the evolution patterns in a particular knowledge networking structure denoted as distributed networks of practice. The paper conceptualizes this kind of network of practice as an information and communication technology (ICT) facilitated dynamic relationship of participants that are geographically and temporally dispersed from one another, and who are sharing and creating knowledge related to their daily work practices and business problems. Three different categories of networks were identified 1) problem solving networks, 2) business improvement networks, and 3) innovation networks. Findings demonstrate that the networks evolved differently over time, and the study identified four distinct evolution patterns comprising 1) devolution in terms of short life cycle and dissolution, 2) recursive patterns where new ad&#8209;hoc networks emerged from the mother network, 3) integration of knowledge practices through cross&#8209;network proposals, and 4) innovation and expansion in scope and size. While previous studies have suggested fixed models for how a life cycle of a community takes place, this study however identified four dissimilar evolution patterns. Thus, these findings challenge life cycles models suggested in traditional community of practice research. The paper utilizes an information infrastructure perspective to provide an improved understanding of the evolution patterns within these networks by viewing them as ecological social structures facilitated by a technological infrastructure.  Through social lines of practice and effective knowledge sharing, the participants created an infrastructure of knowing within the organization and managed to alter organizational practices through evolution. The paper illustrates how a knowledge networking structure as such may facilitate distributed work practices and knowledge activities across temporal and spatial boundaries.

Abstract:
It is widely accepted that knowledge management is a critical success factor for enterprises. Not yet known sufficiently are the factors, which influence the success of knowledge management in order to measure the effectiveness of knowledge management. This paper sets out a quantitative study to investigate these factors. Firstly, an overview of empirical work undertaken and the potential success factors is given. After this, the methodology of the study is described. Thereby the basics of structure equation modelling (SEM) are shown. The difference between structure and measurement model is depicted and different validity measures are described. Also two common and possible methods to evaluate a SEM, the co&#8209;variance analysis and the variance analysis are displayed. Thirdly a specific model is presented to use SEM in the context of knowledge management success. The model is based on the theory of planned behaviour and is adapted to the context of knowledge management success. Thereby knowledge management success is seen on an individual level, which means that successful knowledge management leads to a satisfying knowledge supply of the organisation member. Finally limitations of the work are discussed.

A Framework for Assessing Commensurability of Semantic Web Ontologies
Pages:
pp91&#8209;102
Authors:
Liam Magee
Abstract:
The Semantic Web proposes a framework for establishing a "web of data", analogous to the "web of documents" of the World Wide Web. It envisions a series of interconnected ontologies, underwritten by formal languages such as OWL and RDF. The problem of co&#8209;ordinating disparate ontologies has led to the development of various ontology matching approaches. However, as these approaches are algorithmic they cannot make use of background or tacit information about the ontologies they examine â€” information only available in the broader social context in which ontologies are created and used. In many practical knowledge management scenarios, such information is vital in understanding the costs, feasibility and scope of ontology alignment projects. Prior to undertaking the detailed task of concept&#8209;to&#8209;concept mapping between two ontologies, it is therefore useful to ask: are these ontologies broadly commensurable? This paper presents a framework for describing and comparing cultural information about ontologies, developed as part of a joint project conducted by RMIT University and FujiXerox Australia, "Towards the 'Semantic Web': Standards and Interoperability across Document Management and Publishing Supply Chains". The framework is intended for practitioners to use as a tool to arrive at better estimates and assessments of the scope of work required to develop an adequate translation between two or more ontologies. The framework has been piloted as an online software toolkit, which is presented to a small group of participants. After using the software, participants complete an evaluation, which elicits quantitative and qualitative feedback on both the framework and the software. The paper presents the results of the pilot testing process, along with some considerations of how the framework might be further improved.

Title:
Assessing the Impact of KM on Organisational Practice: Applying the MeCTIP Model to UK Organisations
Pages:
pp103&#8209;118
Authors:
Sandra Moffett
Anne Hinds
Abstract:
With the emergence of the knowledge intensive industry, where organisations rely on the knowledge of their staff for competitive advantage (Lustri et al., 2007), KM has become key for business success (Mu&#8209;jung et al., 2007). KM, once seen as a fad (Ramsey, 1996) is now an integral business function (Zhou and Fink, 2003) in both traditional and internet&#8209;based businesses (Borges Tiago et al., 2007) to the extent that KM is now viewed essential for profit (Yang, 2008). Despite the great progress made in KM over the past decade (Omega Editorial, 2009) much confusion exists around the practical implementation of knowledge&#8209;orientated programmes, resulting in either an overemphasis on technology to the exclusion of adequate peoplequality planning, or, strong peoplequality programmes from a knowledge perspective, hindered by inadequate enabling technologies. For example, organisations question how current KM models, frameworks and programmes can be applied across all organisations uniformly? If changes are necessary to the approach adopted by an organisation, what are these changes and are the drivers behind the change approaches largely implementation modifications or are there more fundamental issues to be resolved? Are the most important issues (King, 2007) being addressed? How is KM success defined? (Jennex and Croasdell, 2007) Considering the large investment capital expended by many firms in KM systems (Curley, 1998) and the growing number of companies that see KM as potentially helping them survive and compete, there is a need for more definitive and comprehensive studies in this field for systematic empirical research and in&#8209;depth rich case studies. This paper presents results of empirical research undertaken in early 2009 with 588 UK companies. Research purpose is to assess the impact of the MeCTIP model [Moffett, 2000; Moffett et al., 2002, 2003] on UK companies to identify key factors for successful implementation, practice and development of KM. The research employs the 'Benchmarking KM' online survey tool. This paper focuses on research methodology and initial survey results using statistical analysis techniques such as descriptives and factor analysis. Avenues for further research are identified.

Functional Concept for a Web&#8209;Based Knowledge Impact and IC Reporting Portal

Abstract:
Knowledge and Intellectual Capital (IC) are key resources and crucial fields of investment in today's business organisations and the economy. Problems in strategically and effectively using those resources mainly consist in: (i) how to specify, summarize, visualize the current state of knowledge and IC; (ii) how to comfortably provide access to scattered and ill&#8209;structured information on the current state of knowledge and IC; (iii) how to define, understand, visualize the impact of knowledge on organizational performance and of IC on the economy; (iv) how to assess and evaluate strategies and activities for purposefully intervening in organizations and economies by means of knowledge and IC. To overcome this, the paper presents methods, functionality and tools forming a web&#8209;based infrastructure which provides user&#8209;friendly access to information and understanding of knowledge impacts and IC market at company, sector, national and global levels. This infrastructure basically consists of two sections. The first section enables us to immediately benchmark a company's knowledge management maturity according to specific input data and information, provide tailored feedback and suggest changes in the company's strategy concerning knowledge&#8209;related activities. With this, companies should be motivated to provide their data and support continuous testing, evaluation and improvement of all methods, models, measures and benchmarks following an experimental design. The second section consists of a "World Atlas on Intellectual Capital" comprising world&#8209;wide data on the following constituents of the IC market: demand, supply, equilibrium, investment, need, stock, flow, and returns. With this, the web&#8209;based knowledge impact and IC reporting portal will support decision makers at company and political levels to purposefully intervene on the attitude towards knowledge and IC through guidelines. Consequently, the paper contributes to research and development to measure and with this to develop a better understanding of the impact of knowledge (management) and IC on the delivery of effective business processes and high value services.

Title:
Evaluating a Living Model of Knowledge

Abstract:
The definition of knowledge has always been a contentious issue in knowledge management. Effective knowledge management requires a definition of knowledge that is consistent, useful and true. Whilst most definitions today fulfil the first two criteria, none accurately address all three, including the true, biological nature of knowledge. This is where autopoiesis can help. Autopoiesis was developed to try to answer the question of what makes something living, using a scientific methodology. It proposes living things are discrete, self&#8209;producing entities and constantly cognising entities. Autopoiesis has long inspired definitions of knowledge, with ideas such as: knowledge cannot be transferred, or knowledge can only be created by the potential 'knower'. Using the theory of autopoiesis, it is possible to create a biologically grounded model of knowledge, representing the latest thinking in neuroscience. However, before this new, biologically grounded model of knowledge can be integrated into new or existing knowledge management theories, it needs to be tested, else it falls into the trap of being conceptual, and remaining that way. This paper starts with the autopoietic, and therefore biologically, grounded model of knowledge, and develops the new evaluation framework necessary to test the model. The evaluation methodology developed in this research started from the field of programme evaluation and was adapted to meet the needs of the knowledge management discipline. This paper subsequently presents the initial findings from the evaluation process and takes the first steps to identifying how knowledge management can improve with its newly found scientific grounding.

People, Technology, Processes and Risk Knowledge Sharing
Pages:
pp139&#8209;150
Authors:

Abstract:
The present global economic crisis creates doubts about the good use of accumulated experience and knowledge in managing risk in financial services. Typically, risk management practice does not use knowledge management (KM) to improve and to develop new answers to the threats. A key reason is that it is not clear how to break down the "organizational silos" view of risk management (RM) that is commonly taken. As a result, there has been relatively little work on finding the relationships between RM and KM. We have been doing research for the last couple of years on the identification of relationships between these two disciplines. At ECKM 2007 we presented a general review of the literature(s) and some hypotheses for starting research on KM and its relationship to the perceived value of enterprise risk management. This article presents findings based on our preliminary analyses, concentrating on those factors affecting the perceived quality of risk knowledge sharing. These come from a questionnaire survey of RM employees in organisations in the financial services sector, which yielded 121 responses. We have included five explanatory variables for the perceived quality of risk knowledge sharing. These comprised two variables relating to people (organizational capacity for work coordination and perceived quality of communication among groups), one relating to process (perceived quality of risk control) and two related to technology (web channel functionality and RM information system functionality).  Our findings so far are that four of these five variables have a significant positive association with the perceived quality of risk knowledge sharing: contrary to expectations, web channel functionality did not have a significant association. Indeed, in some of our exploratory regression studies its coefficient (although not significant) was negative. In stepwise regression, the variable organizational capacity for work coordination accounted for by far the largest part of the variation in the dependent variable perceived quality of risk knowledge sharing. The "people" variables thus appear to have the greatest influence on the perceived quality of risk knowledge sharing, even in a sector that relies heavily on technology and on quantitative approaches to decision making. We have also found similar results with the dependent variable perceived value of Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) implementation.

Knowledge&#8209;Based Strategies for Knowledge Intensive Business Services: a Multiple Case&#8209;study of Computer Service Companies
Pages:
pp151&#8209;160
Authors:
Enrico Scarso
Ettore Bolisani
Abstract:
While knowledge is increasingly considered to be a key resource for companies, the models for formulating business strategies that explicitly include it as a core component are still lacking. The paper investigates such issues by considering the particular case of computer service companies, which can be seen as Knowledge Intensive Business Services (KIBS) firms connecting the sources of innovation (i.e. large multinationals, research laboratories, universities, etc.) to the individual needs of the local customers. In doing so they operate as mediators between the local cognitive requirements and the more generic knowledge available in the global environment. Since those companies base their competitiveness on the capability to manage knowledge flows among various actors, the formulation of their business strategies requires new approaches that directly focus on knowledge assets and relevant processes. The paper describes the results of a survey involving twenty&#8209;one computer service companies located in the Northeast of Italy. The study allows the user to draw useful schemes for the identification of knowledge&#8209;based strategies, which can be of use beyond the specific context of investigation. In particular, rather than proposing completely new models for knowledge&#8209;based strategic formulations, the paper analyses the way knowledge can be integrated into more traditional strategic frameworks. The assumption is that these approaches can be more comfortable and understandable by the management of companies whose business is strongly based on knowledge but don't have deliberate knowledge management strategies.

Measuring the Effects of Knowledge Management Practices
Pages:
pp161&#8209;170
Authors:
Geoff Turner
Clemente Minonne
Abstract:
Successful managers focus their attention on factors that are critical in establishing and maintaining an organisation's competitive edge. The knowledge and skill of employees is one of those factors and it requires proactive management attention. Conceptually, this is achieved through Knowledge Management, a term that has existed in the mainstream of business lexicon for quite some time. Despite this, there is the conspicuous absence of a common understanding of the term that frustrates many managers. Studies have clearly established that there are three interdependent and complementary pillars that support the concept of Knowledge Management. These are Organisational Learning Management (OLM), Organisational Knowledge Management (OKM) and Intellectual Capital Management (ICM). OLM, which has so far dominated both academic and practitioner debate, concerns itself with the problem of capturing, organising and retrieving explicit knowledge, or information, and has led to the simplistic misconception that Knowledge Management only involves the capture, or downloading, of the content of employees' minds. ICM is dominated by those particularly interested in defining key performance indicators that will measure the impact and the benefits of applying knowledge management practices. If management requires measurement this is an essential task but it can only be undertaken once an organisation has clearly established the strategy&#8209;structure&#8209;process parameters to ensure it accesses, creates and embeds the knowledge that it needs...the OKM pillar of knowledge management. This paper looks more deeply at this pillar and in particular the lack of a general integrative approach to enhancing organisational performance in this key strategic area. It considers to what extent such an approach may help an organisation more effectively manage its most relevant source of competitive advantage. With a greater awareness of the various factors allied to the managing and leveraging of human oriented and system oriented knowledge assets, some proposals are put forward to assist in developing or redefining an organisation's intellectual capital reporting models in search of a planning, control and performance measurement system that accounts for the management of an organisation's intellectual assets.

Abstract:
During the last decade, the Thai government has recognized that Thailand needs to move toward an economy not only based on the cheapness of labour but also based on its intellectual capital and innovation capability. Therefore, the country has set up initiatives and specific policy to attract multinational corporations that could contribute to raise the research and development capacity of the country. Several studies have been undertaken to evaluate the role that Multinational corporations could play in knowledge creation, technology diffusion and development of potential R&D within South East Asia. Amongst the several approaches investigating the factors fostering Innovation in developing countries, one strategy would be to strength the Universities&#8209;Industries (UI) relationship. The success and failure of the University&#8209;Industry linkage has been widely discussed, but there is still a need to understand the dimensions impacting on the willingness of multinational corporations to share knowledge with Thai Universities. This paper discusses the balance of factors (industrial characteristics, firm characteristics and business models) that can play a substantial role in enhancing the knowledge sharing mechanisms.

Intellectual Capital Development
Pages:
pp181&#8209;192
Authors:
Eckhard Ammann
Abstract:
An approach for intellectual capital development in an organisation is given. It is based on a new conception of knowledge and knowledge dynamics and raises the notion of knowledge conversions to the level of intellectual capital domains. Intellectual capital development can be modelled with this approach by means of general transformations between domains and between appropriate parts of these domains, which themselves are refined and modelled with general knowledge conversions. To attain this approach, a new conception of knowledge and knowledge dynamics is introduced. The knowledge conception is represented by a knowledge cube, a three&#8209;dimensional model of knowledge with types, kinds and qualities. The type dimension addresses the internal&#8209;external aspect of knowledge, seen from the perspective of the human being. The kind dimension distinguishes various knowledge kinds like propositional or procedural knowledge. Finally, in the quality dimension, several quality measures of knowledge are given. Built on this conception, knowledge dynamics is modelled with the help of general knowledge conversions between knowledge assets. A set of basic knowledge conversions is given in a way, such that more complex general conversions may be easily gained by building on this set. Through this conception, we gain a sound basis for knowledge management and development in an enterprise. Raising this knowledge development approach to the more strategic and resource&#8209;oriented intellectual capital level in an organisation, general transformations between the three main intellectual capital domains (individual competence, internal and external structure) and between parts of them can be described. With their help a model for intellectual capital development is gained: In a top&#8209;down approach, general transformations of intellectual capital are broken down to the notion of general knowledge conversions. This leads to development of the intellectual capital, i.e. to value creation in a company. To indicate the applicability of our approach, an example for the development of customer relations capital is given.

Abstract:
It is widely recognized that knowledge&#8209;based resources and assets are fundamental to performance improvement and organizational value creation. Limited progress has been made, however, in valuing and managing organizational knowledge in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) operating in the renewable energy sector. This paper provides first insights of an ongoing research project managed by the Intellectual Assets Centre in Scotland, in order to support the adoption of knowledge asset management initiatives for driving the improvement of value creation mechanisms of SMEs operating in the renewable energy sector. We employ research related to resource&#8209;based and knowledge&#8209;based theory and performance measurement and management, to gain a better understanding of how Scottish SMEs operating in the renewable energy industry acquire and manage knowledge assets in their bid to improve performance and value creation. Using a sample of organizations from the Scottish renewable energy sector we draw first insights about their perception and orientation to identifying, measuring and managing knowledge, and to qualitatively identify a feasible set of knowledge resources and assets potentially driving performance improvement. The first evidence indicates an awareness of the relevance of the knowledge&#8209;based factors, and engagement in knowledge acquisition and creation processes. These firms possess a good endowment of knowledge assets, with significant internal knowledge management processes, but also external inflows from agents such as firms and education or research institutions. However, the visible lag in the exploitation of knowledge assets and processes, together with observed under&#8209;financing of the sector and difficulty in accessing skilled labor, indicates the need for efforts to better address specific needs of renewable energy sector SMEs.

Why Intellectual Capital Management Accreditation is a Tool for Organizational Development?

Abstract:
In March 2000, the European Council held an extraordinary meeting to agree a new strategic goal for the European Union in order to strengthen a knowledge&#8209;based economy. The Council has a strategy &#8209; the Lisbon Strategy &#8209; aiming in the next 10 years to make the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge&#8209;based economy in the world. Intellectual capital has become a key element of the knowledge economy. Its management is therefore a factor influencing the competitive advantage of companies, regions and even countries. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the importance of intellectual capital management accreditation as a factor in the organizational development of companies, especially small and medium&#8209;sized enterprises (SMEs). The methodology ICMA &#8209; Intellectual Capital Management Accreditation (Matos and Lopes, 2009) will be discussed here, as well as the effect of this methodology on SMEs' innovation processes. It is considered that intellectual capital management accreditation may be a relevant process in the consolidation of an innovative dynamic, which will contribute to the continuous creation of competitive advantages. There are various intellectual capital valuation methodologies, but the research about the effect of the certification and accreditation is still very limited so it is necessary to get more results. However, the methodological research that supported the ICMA system points to the fact of accreditation procedures favouring better management of intellectual capital, thus contributing significantly to improving the organizational performance of accredited companies. This paper also aims to contribute to the international recognition of the importance of the audit of intellectual capital.

What National Intellectual Capital Indices Can Tell About the Global Economic Crisis of 2007&#8209;2009?

pp253&#8209;266
Authors:

Leif Edvinsson
Abstract:
In the past few years, the concept of intellectual capital has been expanded from organizational level to national and regional level. A model of 29 national intellectual capital indices (NICI40) has been constructed and validated by utilizing data of the IMD Competitiveness Yearbook. Research on the 14 years data, spanning from 1995 to 2008, indicates the pattern and progression of national intellectual capital in 40 countries. Trend analyses of this set of panel data disclose very interesting phenomena, such as Iceland shows the most rapid progress in national intellectual capital and is a rising star in economic development with an outstanding 94% GDP per capita (ppp) growth over 14 years. Moreover, it was number one of the OECD countries according to The Global Benchmark Report 2006 and received a consistently high ranking in world standard&#8209;of&#8209;living surveys. Unfortunately, the recent financial crisis almost crippled its national financial system and wrote off its past economic performance. On the contrary, Norway lags behind its Nordic peers in national intellectual capital development; yet its resilience to the 2007&#8209;2009 financial crisis impact is noticeable. Furthermore, Norway generously offers financial support for IMF to assist some ailing neighboring countries. Why the intellectual capital rising star crumbled down and the seemingly static country sustained the crisis? What is the implication of this controversy? The research results of this study have some implications for relevant policy makers.

A Framework for Knowledge Integration and Social Capital in Collaborative Projects

Abstract:
Collaborative projects are increasingly common today and such projects require specialized knowledge of the partners to be integrated, therefore posing the challenge of inter&#8209;organizational knowledge integration; integrating diverse knowledge bases across organizations. Studies on knowledge integration and inter&#8209;organizational networks indicate the positive influence of social capital in the context. Since partners in a collaborative project are likely to possess this resource due to their partnership, a knowledge integration view is adopted to conduct an empirical investigation of a three&#8209;partner collaborative project to investigate the influence of social capital. The study shows how the different aspects of social capital influence the knowledge integration behaviour of the partners for the project. Implications to research and practice are discussed.

Knowledge Management in Evidence&#8209;Based Medical Practice: Does the Patient Matter?
Pages:
pp281&#8209;292
Authors:
William Boateng
Abstract:
Evidence&#8209;based medicine has greatly influenced decisions and actions throughout the health care industry for a couple of decades, particularly in the advanced countries. However, little is known as to how patients with their tacit knowledge have fitted into the evidence&#8209;based medical practice equation especially in the developing world, hence the need for this study. The combined use of the theory of communicative action and the AGIL taxonomy of adaptation, goal attainment, integration, and latent pattern maintenance by Talcott Parsons served as the theoretical framework for the study. The theory of communicative action provided the benchmark in understanding how doctors and patients are motivated to adapt and integrate the explicit and tacit knowledge forms in attaining the goal of quality evidence&#8209;based medical practice in line with the AGIL taxonomy. The qualitative interviews with fifty respondents &#8209; twenty doctors and thirty patients &#8209; in the central region of Ghana are utilized as the data base for the discussion. The study concludes that at present patients’ tacit knowledge does not matter in the practice of evidence&#8209;based medicine in Ghana. This situation has to be addressed by empowering patients to be actively involved in clinical decision&#8209;making affecting their health. This is critical because effective implementation of evidence&#8209;based medical practice demands a good blend of explicit and tacit knowledge forms possessed by doctors and patients respectively. It is believed that embracing this strategy of managing knowledge in the health care dispensation holds the potential to bring about improved health care outcomes.

In the Knowledge Based Economy, research centres whether industrial or public, play a fundamental role. In terms of Knowledge Management, these organisations have a special status, because their production is knowledge and only knowledge. The Knowledge Capital they accumulate in their activities therefore is a strong strategic issue and the management of these assets has become crucial. The problem addressed in this paper is to design a pertinent methodology for Knowledge Management considering the specificity of knowledge production by research centres. This methodology is based on a suitable model to describe that knowledge production. The reference model is built on knowledge flows between the organisation and its knowledge workers, and a subsystem called “Knowledge Capital”. A research centre is defined by the fact that its product is only knowledge and is accumulated in its knowledge subsystem. Some economical characteristics of this Knowledge Capital are shown as being very adapted to knowledge produced in research centres. The methodology is based on two tools. The first tool is the knowledge map that can represent a comprehensive model of the Knowledge Capital of the organisation, which is often not well known or unstructured. That map is built on a shared and consensual vision of the main knowledge actors. It is not a map produced by a knowledge tool, but a co&#8209;construction (through interviews) with the knowledge actors. The second tool is a grid for criticality analysis (Critical Knowledge Factors), which evaluates the knowledge domains of the organisation and suggests appropriate actions to be put in place for the most critical domains. This tool is a guide for interviewing knowledgeable actors in the organisation, to collect and analyse a set of data for decision support. The aim of the methodology is to provide a set of recommendations to build a KM plan of actions to preserve, share and make evolve the Knowledge Capital. The methodology has been elaborated through constant feed&#8209;back with practice, and has been validated in many real cases in various countries. Three case studies (France, Brazil, and Canada) are succinctly described to exemplify the effectiveness of the methodology.

Title:
Is Tacit Knowledge Really Tacit?

Mari Eerikäinen
Abstract:
The aim of this article is to increase understanding of tacit knowledge as a phenomenon and also, to specify and understand tacit knowledge of an expert in a given context. In the discourse of organizational behavior, the use of the concept of tacit knowledge and empirical scientific research on it has become more popular only in the 1990s. The strong increase in expert work and knowledge&#8209;intensive fields make examining the topic timely and both theoretically and practically interesting. The most significant theoretical contribution of the study is the increase in understanding, as well as, the creation of new knowledge of the contents and the nature of tacit knowledge. Based on our study, it seems that the current division of knowledge to explicit and tacit is not sufficient to describe the phenomenon. It has been proposed that explicit knowledge is visible and “articulated” knowledge that can easily be transferred and codified, e.g., through speech, documents and various information management systems. Implicit knowledge, on the other hand, is “silent”, hidden and non&#8209;verbal knowledge that is difficult or even impossible to transfer and express verbally. We propose that tacit knowledge comprises different components, some of which can be articulated and made explicit. Examples of such are individual’s or organizations accustomed lines of action that are based on explicit instructions. On the other hand, individual&#8209;specific tacit knowledge that includes feelings, emotions and intuition, individual’s intuitive behaviour or personal relationships, can be considered as “the genuine tacit knowledge” in the sense that it cannot be made visible or transferred. These findings suggest that the interconnectedness of explicit and tacit knowledge ought to be examined further.

The Inertia Problem: Implementation of a Holistic Design Support System

Abstract:
This paper describes and reflects on the implementation of a Knowledge Based Holistic Design Support System – termed “HolD” – into a business environment. The paper introduces the rationale and development behind the system, a consciously different approach to traditional knowledge based systems in engineering in order to meet the requirements of a small business, producing bespoke low volume products. Typical knowledge based engineering systems rely on explicitly codified knowledge which often supports product optimisation rather than creative design activities. Such a system would provide little benefit to a business producing bespoke products. Instead, the system presented here, supports the creativity of designers through codified tacit knowledge input by designers as meta&#8209;data for past designs. The problem of individual inertia in adopting the system and sharing knowledge was approached early in the construction of the system. The steps taken to lower user barriers and encourage day&#8209;to&#8209;day use are detailed, including the design of a multi&#8209;stage input process designed to interact at key stages of users' existing processes. The immediate results after a six month trial period are presented and the results show slower than anticipated usage. In particular designers were found to be reluctant to input detailed information beyond common identifying data and did not attempt to seek information from the system. The reasons for this slower usage are discussed and possible solutions presented. The paper therefore provides industrial based evidence of the inertia encountered when implementing a knowledge system and argues that technology alone is insufficient to overcome this inertia.

The Knowledge&#8209;Based Foundations of Organisational Performance Improvements: An Action Research Approach
Pages:
pp333&#8209;344
Authors:
Giovanni Schiuma
Daniela Carlucci
Abstract:
The strategic and management literature grounded on the resource and knowledge based view of the firm, has widely outlined the importance of knowledge assets in a company’s value creation. However, despite acknowledgment of the strategic relevance of knowledge assets and their management for driving organizational performance improvement, there is still a lack of suitable approaches to disentangle, explain and assess how knowledge assets support the achievement of a company’s strategic outcomes. The paper investigates the role and relevance of knowledge assets in a company’s performance improvement and provides some approaches, tools and managerial suggestions regarding the leveraging knowledge assets as value drivers for improving organisational performance. Methodology: The study is based on action research methodology. Findings: This paper highlights the role and relevance of knowledge assets as critical factors to manage for improving a company’s performance. In particular, integrating the results of an action research project with the main insights from a literature review, the paper provides some approaches, tools and managerial suggestions mainly regarding: i) the identification and mapping of knowledge assets to be managed in order to improve performances; ii) the choice and the design of knowledge assets management initiatives; iii) the evaluation of the performance improvement gained by the implementation of knowledge assets management initiatives. Research limitations: The paper investigates the leveraging knowledge assets for a company’s performance improvement in a specific context of analysis, i.e. the New Product Development (NPD) process. In order to have a more holistic view of the interactions between knowledge assets and company’s value creation mechanisms, an extension of the investigation to other organisational processes is required. Moreover, to generalise the research’s results, several applications in different industries and the use of different research methodologies are required. Practical implications: The paper, on the basis of theoretical and empirical insights, provides four managerial practices which managers might use in order to design and implement knowledge assets management initiatives aimed to support the improvement of company’s performances. Originality/value: The paper provides more light on how knowledge assets and complementarities among them enhance organization’s performances and provides approaches, tools and managerial suggestions for supporting managers in developing and leveraging knowledge assets. Especially the proposed approaches and tools intended to provide managers with information to assist them to allocate their managerial efforts to the knowledge assets with significant impact on performance.

Exploring Web 2.0 Applications as a Mean of Bolstering up Knowledge Management

Abstract:
Abstract: Web 2.0 applications aim at improving the interaction between users. Web 2.0 principles overlap with characteristics of knowledge management (KM) or could be applied to reshape KM practices. Applying Web 2.0 applications to KM has the potential to improve the sharing and creation of knowledge. However, little research has been conducted in this area. This research aims at identifying Web 2.0 applications for bolstering up organizations’ KM practices. An additional aspect addressed is how Web 2.0 applications for KM can be categorized and how they match different aspects of the KM strategy of an organization. The research examines the suitability of Web 2.0 applications in KM by conducting exploratory case studies in two student&#8209;run organizations, which are an interesting research subject because their members are considered most open towards new technologies. The case studies aim at exploring which Web 2.0 applications are in place. Based on the findings we propose a framework for categorizing Web 2.0 applications for KM. The findings indicate that Web 2.0 applications may enhance KM and may even initiate a new era of KM. Moreover, the article provides a discussion of a number of Web 2.0 applications and proposes a way of categorizing these applications. The proposed framework allows assessing the use of Web 2.0 applications for KM and can be used as an orientation for the introduction of Web 2.0 applications in organizational KM. The research contributes to the general understanding of how Web 2.0 applications can be used in KM. The proposed framework for categorizing Web 2.0 applications provides an orientation for organizations that want to use these applications for bolstering up their KM practices.

Inter&#8209;generational learning dynamics in universities

Abstract:
Inter generational learning is an open process people of all ages can learn from each other in a stimulating context. It is a complex process of knowledge sharing that overcomes age and cultural barriers. Inter&#8209;generational learning is more specific for those organizations where people group together in age layers or strata. Universities are such kind of layered or nested organizations. The purpose of this paper is to present some results of our research in the field of inter&#8209;generational learning and knowledge sharing in universities. This topic is important because a university is by its own nature a nested knowledge organization, due to a continuous flow of students and the bottom&#8209;up regeneration of the faculty staff. Knowledge creation and knowledge loss are intertwined processes, and both of them are strongly influenced by the age scale. A university is a multilayered knowledge organization, where the inner most layers are represented by older professors who concentrate the fundamental structures of knowledge, and the outer layers are represented by students in their different learning cycles. In this paper we are interested in assessing the choices done by the academic staff, in the context of the determinant criterions and trade&#8209;offs in inter&#8209;generational learning. This had been done in the framework of Analytic Hierarchic Processes (AHP). We thought that this is a proper tool since it mainly belongs to the field of decision&#8209;making with the possibility to determine vectors of priorities for the individuals participating in the decisions under study.

Abstract:
The Spanish healthcare system has undergone important changes, particularly with respect to the development of new hospital services. Today, more than ever, the factors that define the nature and structured of the Spanish healthcare environment (e.g. demand, costs, system deregulation) are undergoing rapid change thus obliging hospital administrators to develop and implement flexible and adaptive strategies in order to survive in an increasingly challenging environment facing hospital management. This work examines how the existence of some learning practices is linked to knowledge transfer and how this component is linked to relational capital. These relationships are examined through an empirical investigation of 54 doctors and 62 nurses belonging to 44 Hospital&#8209;in&#8209;the&#8209;Home Units. In an applied sense, the findings provide homecare practitioners with identifiable factors, which enable two learning models (conceptual and operational) and address the relevant issues by changing strategies at both the individual and organisational levels.

SPF 5 and Limitations to Investing in Knowledge Management

Authors:

Abstract:
This paper will continue our work concerning the strategic management of intellectual capital. Based on the Rothberg/Erickson SPF framework which balances knowledge development with knowledge protection, we continue to explore differing circumstances and their impact on IC strategy. The framework differentiates between IC that needs to be aggressively developed by the firm (or not) and IC that is vulnerable to competitive intelligence incursion and needs protection (or not). Previously, we have looked at an environment within which substantial development of IC is necessary in order to be competitive but in which those same knowledge assets are at risk from competitive efforts to appropriate them (Erickson & Rothberg 2009b). In this paper, we will develop the scenario wherein aggressive development of IC may not be useful (highly tacit knowledge, difficult to share or apply in other situations) and little competitive intelligence activity is taking place (SPF 5 in the framework). In particular, we will characterize the nature of this environment in terms of theory, identify representative firms and industries, and apply data to the framework. Where appropriate, contrasts with other SPF environments will also be made.

Abstract:
In this study, we sketch a problem&#8209;based perspective of the service business, following the latest theoretical developments in the field of the knowledge&#8209;based view of the firm and the related problem&#8209;solving perspective. In particular, we approach services as problems to be solved for and with the customer. Our paper outlines a framework in which the knowledge processes regarding service delivery are conceptualized on two axes: 1) the intensity of knowledge sharing and co&#8209;creation of services between the provider and the customer and 2) the nature of the problem&#8209;solving process regarding the service delivery. Based on the developed conceptual framework, we provide implications concerning the organizing of various types of services in terms of the different problem&#8209;solving processes they require. Furthermore, after identifying the distinctive problem&#8209;solving processes with the help of the typology, theoretical and practical implications for service and knowledge management are discussed.

Trust&#8209;Building Mechanisms for the Provision of Knowledge&#8209;Intensive Business Services
Pages:
pp46&#8209;56
Authors:
Enrico Scarso
Ettore Bolisani
Abstract:
The term knowledge&#8209;intensive business services (KIBS) indicates private companies whose job consists of collecting, generating, analysing, and distributing knowledge with the purpose of delivering customized services to satisfy client’s needs. KIBS firms rely on highly educated professionals, and supply knowledge resources or other knowledge&#8209;based services that clients are unable or unwilling to develop by themselves. The provision of KIBS entails a bilateral exchange of knowledge between the service provider and the end user along with the entire supply cycle. In this process, not only KIBS firms supply clients with precious elements of technical and applicative knowledge, but also client firms provide KIBS with pieces of knowledge that are necessary for designing a successful solution. As is well underlined in the literature, trust is an essential ingredient of client&#8209;provider knowledge exchanges, so that KIBS companies have deal with it properly. This is not simple, since trust has several dimensions that rely on different trust&#8209;building mechanisms. In light of this, the paper aims to analyse the different forms of trust and the related trust&#8209;building mechanisms that come into play during the delivery of a knowledge&#8209;intensive service. This is done by discussing the findings of a multiple case&#8209;study of a particular group of KIBS, i.e. computer service companies located in the Northeast of Italy. Specifically, the study: a) offers a knowledge&#8209;oriented description of the interactions that take place during the service delivery process between client and KIBS firms; b) analyses the role played by the different forms of trust, as antecedents and consequences of each interaction; c) makes some remarks about the trust building mechanisms that a KIBS company can exploit, and the resulting management implications.

Abstract:
This paper focuses on the question: how can a personal work profile be created most easily and effectively for people considering their future? A personal work profile is a detailed description of the skills a person would like to use and characteristics of a work environment they would like to experience. This is valuable for all people of working age because it helps them find, or move towards, work which suits them best. This is tremendously important in Knowledge Management (KM). This is because when the an individual’s knowledge and skills are matched well with the work they conduct, there is a high level of job satisfaction, motivation and performance. Therefore, if there is a good match, employees and organisations benefit enormously. The paper categorises and critically examines literature relevant to the research question and explains why the new Look Into your FuturE (LIFE) technique (‘the LIFE Technique’) was designed, what is new about it, how it works and how it has been road tested, reflected upon and improved. The primary data strongly suggests that the stages of the Technique are useful and easy to do, and that it is a valuable initiative that should be developed and applied further in the future.

The Changing Role of Knowledge in Companies: How to Improve Business Performance Through Knowledge

pp73&#8209;84
Authors:
Gaby Neumann
Eduardo Tome
Abstract:
Knowledge is widely accepted as strategic resource in companies, but its developmental potential is often not well exploited. Amongst others this is caused by the wide variety of knowledge management concepts, methods and tools challenging company management in selecting the appropriate measure for the specific company situation and developmental goal. Furthermore, knowledge is directly linked to people and knowledge&#8209;based interventions therefore cannot be successful without reaching the company’s employees and getting them involved in any change processes. Against this background the paper discusses the changing role of knowledge in companies and investigates how knowledge&#8209;based change processes in companies need to be launched and run. Based upon this a methodological framework is proposed in order to help companies in identifying their needs for change and purposefully intervening in their processes and eventually to lend them a hand in managing their human resources, selecting technology or changing the organisation. Conclusions open up the view towards future research still required for achieving the goal of methodologically grounded managerial support and guidelines on how to best intervene in company knowledge.

Building a Knowledge Management Model at Brazil's Embrapa (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation): Towards a Knowledge&#8209;Based View of Organizations

Abstract:
This paper investigates and analyses the process of building a knowledge management (KM) model at Brazil’s Embrapa (The Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation). Embrapa is a world class knowledge organization whose mission is to provide feasible solutions for the sustainable development of Brazilian agribusiness through knowledge and technology generation and transfer. The qualitative research strategy used was the study of a single case with incorporated units of analysis and two criteria were observed for the judgment of the quality of the research project: validity of the construct  and reliability. Multiple sources of evidence were used and data analysis consisted of three flows of activities: data reduction, data displays and conclusion drawing/verification. The results revealed a robust KM model made of four dynamic axes: (i) strategy (a strategic conception of information and knowledge use), (ii) environment &#8209; four different groups of enabling conditions (social&#8209;behavioral, information/communication, cognitive/epistemic and business/managerial), sine qua non conditions for successful implementation, (iii) tool box – sets of IT tools and managerial practices and (iv) results – in terms of outputs, being both tangible and intangible assets. The conclusions suggest that a collaborative building of a KM model in a diverse and geographically dispersed organization is more likely to succeed than one that is build and implemented from the top&#8209;down perspective. Embrapa’s KM Model is more inclined to be a knowledge&#8209;based view of organization than merely a KM model. Limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are also discussed.

Knowledge Audit with Intellectual Capital in the Quality Management Process: An Empirical Study in an Electronics Company
Pages:
pp98&#8209;116
Authors:
Percy Chi Wai Chan
W.B. Lee
Abstract:
Most of the intellectual capital (IC) assessment tools are based on a “top&#8209;down” approach which does not explore deeply into the particular business process and the specific knowledge needs. Those IC assessment tools generally measure the intellectual capital of an organization as the return on intangible assets covering Human Capital (HC) such as staff skills, innovativeness and work experience, Structural Capital (SC) such as IT systems, documents and patents, and Relational Capital (RC) such as relationship with customers and suppliers. Traditional IC assessment tools with “IC reporting” deliverables aim at identifying useful knowledge that can create wealth for the organization in assessing the performance and value creation process. In contrary, a systematic “knowledge audit” is a process&#8209;oriented and stock&#8209;taking approach for evaluating the “knowledge healthiness” of an organization from the “bottom&#8209;up”. There is potential to merge two methodologies into one integrated assessment tool to present a comprehensive IC reporting in an organization. Knowledge assets underpin the capabilities and core competencies of any organization. The importance of a knowledge audit is the first step in determining how knowledge is handled in mission critical business processes in an organization. Quality management processes are the main subsets inside an organization’s critical business processes. A knowledge audit provides an evidence based assessment of the knowledge assets within an organization, however, there is a lack of a systematic approach in the way knowledge audits are conducted. In addition, there is no standard way of measuring Intellectual Capital (IC) through a better understanding of knowledge assets that are captured from a knowledge audit. The two different streams of KM and IC are complementary and provide the cornerstones for the definition of a managerial framework to identify, assess, exploit and manage organizational knowledge. In view of the importance of the knowledge audit and the deficiencies in the standard ways of IC measurement, a structured knowledge audit approach has been applied. This paper presents an integration of knowledge audit and IC reporting approach which has been applied in a Quality Assurance (QA) Department of an electronics company, for knowledge assets stock&#8209;taking in six specified Value Added Quality Management Processes (VAQMP). More than 74 staff, over 4 corporate functions and 5 departments in two manufacturing plants, from different work levels involving 6 quality management processes from each plant, participated in the research. 52 Participants were provided with various knowledge audit forms to complete in order to provide information about the IT tools/platforms, documents, implicit knowledge, as well as the critical industrial technologies in each VAQMP process. Quantitative and qualitative analysis was then undertaken, including stakeholder analysis and the identification of critical knowledge workers, industrial technologies, crucial documents, implicit knowledge, as well as the knowledge fountain and knowledge discovery points of the process. The outcomes and effectiveness of the knowledge audit were evaluated in both KM and IC aspects. In most Intellectual Capital assessment tools, the workflow of the business process and the specific knowledge needs are not taken into account. On the other hand, this structured knowledge audit helps to identify critical organizational knowledge that needs to be captured and transferred for the healthy operation and sustainability of the quality management processes, in order to prevent quality crises. Finally, after the consolidation of the explicit and implicit knowledge inventories, as well as constructing an IC value tree, an intellectual capital statement for the Group Quality Assurance (GQA) Department was produced.

Title:
Knowledge Management, an Enduring but Confusing Fashion
Pages:
pp117&#8209;131
Authors:
Ken Grant
Abstract:
Knowledge Management has been a subject of significant management interest for some 15 years. During that time it has been subjected to a variety of criticisms including the argument that it is little more than a “fad” — something that catches management’s attention for a while and then fades away because of a lack of sustainability. It has been compared to other major management fads such as quality circles and business process re&#8209;engineering. This paper examines the discipline of Knowledge Management (KM) through the lens of management fashion theory. It demonstrates that KM is not a fad and that it has become an enduring management activity. Management Fashion Theory (Abrahamson and Fairchild, 1999) is an extension of Rogers’ Theory of Diffusion of Innovations (Rogers, 2003), that takes a skeptical view of business innovations, viewing the discourse about and the diffusion of innovations as a cultural phenomenon rather than a rational decision making process. After a brief introduction to the field of Knowledge Management (KM), a review of the theories of Diffusion of Innovations and Management Fashion is presented, along with a description of the methodology used to apply Management Fashion Theory to the discourse on KM. Bibliometric and content analysis techniques are used to examine publications and discourse in the field from 1990 to 2009. The analysis of discourse on KM demonstrates a significant period of “latency” from the late 1980s to 1994, during which foundational ideas and precursors to KM appear. Then a rapid growth period is identified, from 1995&#8209;2001 during which KM becomes an innovation of interest to most major organizations. Finally, it appears that discourse has settled at a steady state, with no decline apparent. However, detailed analysis has also indentified a potential conflict between the interests of practitioners and researchers, with a separation of the discourse into distinct groups that may have inconsistent views on what is or is not “Knowledge Management”. In summary, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of discourse on KM. It provides bibliometric evidence that there has been a sustained interest in KM that is quite unlike that of other popular management themes over the last 30 years. It raises some questions about the relevance of some of the research being carried out.

Title:
The Formulaic and Embryonic Dimensions of Knowledge Management Strategy: A Social Practice Perspective
Pages:
pp132&#8209;138
Authors:
Yassaman Imani
Abstract:
Knowledge Management (KM) literature is populated with a variety of perspectives, prescriptions and studies of practice, which can be complex, contradictory and confusing to practitioners who seek to make sense of, and adapt them for practice. A sub&#8209;set of this literature argues that a clear link to business strategy is critical to KM strategy’s success (see Storey & Barnett, 2000; Zack, 1999, 2002), but extant research shows that this link is often weak (Leidner, 1998; Ruggles, 1998; Storey & Barnett, 2000; Zack, 1999). These debates however, adopt a mainly rational perspective which overlooks the ‘emergent’ and ‘sensemaking’ aspects of strategizing. This paper argues that an extended ‘social practice’ (Hendry, 2000), which brings together rational, emergent and sensemaking aspects of strategizing process, provides a useful multi&#8209;perspective framework for investigating the extent to which practitioners’ approach to setting up KM strategies in their firms are influenced by their firms’ business strategies. Using an extended social practice framework, I examined the managerial accounts of the processes of setting up KM strategies in 18 global firms. This study contributes to a better of understanding of the ways in which business strategy influences the KM strategizing process. The findings support extant research by suggesting that a weak link between KM and business strategy existed in these firms. However, this study demonstrates that from the social practice perspective, firms take two different approaches to their KM strategy, formulaic (to support their routine activities) and embryonic (to address their immediate strategic agenda), which signify their enduring and transient KM practices. Finally, this study concludes that further research is needed to explore the dynamic interactions between the formulaic and embryonic KM approaches.

Implementing Knowledge Through Development Projects
Pages:
pp139&#8209;148
Authors:
Erik Laursen
Abstract:
The main objective of this article is the implementation of knowledge in organizations, taking place in the context of development projects. Some of the issues discussed are: What kind of learning conditions do the development projects have to offer? What are the causes and consequences of different levels of engagement from the staff in the projects? Why is often so difficult to transfer what is learned or implemented by the organization during the projects to the everyday activities of the organization after the finishing of projects? In the article a typology of development projects is presented and discussed as different ways of framing the organizational learning processes. The article is based on an empirical study of four organizational development projects (covering the organizations as a whole) run by four Danish upper secondary schools(“gymnasium”). The study included questionnaires as well as interviews with the management and staff, plus a survey of selected written materials and documents . In the various ways in which different groupings among the staff and the management are relating to the project are described. A special focus is set on the different perspectives on the projects established by the staff and the management and how the perspectives have consequences on the actual learning outcomes of the different groups in the organization. Another issue is the weak links between what is experienced by the staff as ‘ordinary problems’ his objectives and goals of the development projects. The theoretical frame of analysis has references to the ‘outside&#8209;in’ perspective on organizational learning, presented by the neo&#8209;institutional theory (Scott 1995 DiMaggion& Powell 1983, Czarniawska & Sevon 2005, Røvik 2007) Nanoka and Takeuchis model of knowledge transformations in organizations (Nonaka & Takeuchi 1995) and of the forms of the knowledge), Argyris and Ellström’s distinction between the learning modes of correction and development (Ellström 2001, Argyris 1992).

Key Performance Indicators Metrics Effect on the Advancement and Sustainability of Knowledge Management

Mohamed Rabhi
Abstract:
This paper addresses the relationship between the value of data and KPs as they relate to the sustainability of knowledge management (KM). Numerical data are compelling metrics to persuade executives and management in the organization of the significance of Knowledge Management. External statistics are usually less impactful than internal data. Nonetheless, and in the absence of internal data at the early phases of KM projects, many companies collect published data for comparable industries. In the present case, we compiled information from previous experiences of companies in the same line of business; therefore, management by&#8209;in was secured, and the KM project was, to some extent, successfully implemented.  However, there was a need to generate in&#8209;house numbers to support promises and claims of KM benefits, and persuade all KM players from the technician to the organisation president; the ultimate objective is to have a sustainable Knowledge Management project across the organization, with visible, concrete, and quantifiable results. Equipped with the assertion “data is power”, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and other metrics were devised and integrated into our KM processes; these measurements are being pulled out systematically, and published to the whole audience. KPIs measured included the effect of KM on (i) customer satisfaction, (ii) business impact (i.e. savings), (iii) number of projects completed on time, (iv) and the number of technical reports generated per unit of research area. Over the past few years, the data we generated shows a considerable increase in customer satisfaction with our research and technical services; significant savings were obtained each year; project timely completion indicator rose to high levels as compared to previous yearly data; the electronic technical and scientific library experienced a build up of valuable know&#8209;how reports. Knowledge re&#8209;use as shown by reliance on internal resources was the standard and routine practice. On the other hand, many other qualitative observations, like effect on health, safety, and the environment are being quantified for inclusion in the KPI reporting. Based on the accumulated data, we believe that numerical values coupled with other tangible solid results will ensure a viable and sustainable KM in our organization. This hypothesis is supported by five year data and trend analysis.  It confirms that internally generated statistics is a powerful tool to sway and re&#8209;assure the organization that KM can indeed increase efficiency, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive savings.

Abstract:
Organizational innovation has been viewed as an essential weapon for organizations to compete in this competitive business environment. Particularly, Malaysia manufacturing firms strive to transform their business model from labor&#8209;intensive to knowledge&#8209;intensive, which aim to immerse themselves in higher value added activities such as, developing new products, processes, and services, to continual sustain the competitiveness within the rivalries. One of the ways to heighten the organizational innovation is through effective human resource management (HRM) practices and effective knowledge management. This study examined the direct relationships between HRM practices (performance appraisal, career management, training, reward system, and recruitment) and organizational innovation (product innovation, process innovation, and administrative innovation). Additionally, it also examined the mediating role of KM effectiveness on the direct relationship. Data was drawn from a sample of 171 large manufacturing firms in Malaysia. The regression results showed that HRM practices generally have a positive effect on organizational innovation. Specifically, the findings indicate that training was positively related to three dimensions of organizational innovation (product innovation, process innovation, and administrative innovation). Performance appraisal also found to have a positive effect on administrative innovation. Additionally, this study also demonstrates that training and performance appraisal, are positively related to knowledge management effectiveness. Knowledge management effectiveness fully mediates the relationship between training and process innovation, training and administrative innovation, and performance appraisal and administrative innovation. A discussion of the findings, limitations, and implications are provided.

Abstract:
Danish society puts a high value on education which is traditionally seen as a crucial vehicle for development in all spheres of social and economic life. Large sums are spent on work&#8209;related adult learning, an important example being academically based masters programs. Yet, the actual effects of such educational investment in terms of improved workplace efficiency remain obscure both with respect to the organization and the individual. The three authors of this article are all involved in planning, managing and teaching at masters programs at Aalborg University, Denmark. Programs are carefully designed with a view to strengthening the link between the educational space (the curriculum and academic priorities) and the students’ habitual working environment (the organizations from which they come). Starting from a theoretical viewpoint based on traditional learning theory, supplemented by research in the field of transfer of training, as well as on Donald A. Schön’s classic work on practicum as a crucial component in the training of practitioners, our article presents, and illustrates with examples, a framework for designing educational programs which can help make academic teaching relevant to production&#8209;oriented life in organizations. The article may be read as a statement from which criteria for evaluating the said masters programs can be generated.

Abstract:
During his keynote address at 3rd European Conference on Intellectual Capital held at University of Nicosia, Cyprus, 18&#8209;19 April 2011, John Girard posed the question, Are You Ready for the Future? This rather rhetorical question was designed to create a conversation about what we should expect in the future in terms of social technology, leadership and a culture of collaboration. Throughout the conference, an excellent dialogue ensued about what the future might hold.  The central focus of this discourse surrounded how collaboration could or should change in the future. The genesis of the keynote was the research completed by John Girard, Cindy Gordon, JoAnn Girard for their recent book Business Goes Virtual: Realizing the Value of Collaboration, Social and Virtual Strategies. This article is adapted from the book and focuses on why business leaders should consider focussing on collaboration.

Virtual Embeddedness and Social Media as a Basis for the Relational Capital Management of new Ventures

Abstract:
New forms of data storage and transfer as well as new methods to communicate, collaborate and exchange knowledge at diminishing transaction costs over the world&#8209;wide&#8209;web have revolutionised networking, knowledge creation and innovation processes in the knowledge era. Virtual embeddedness signifies the possibility to draw upon pay&#8209;per&#8209;use computing resources and a variety of customised web services and applications. The facilitated utilisation of Software&#8209;as&#8209;a&#8209;Service and in particular social media (SM) applications enables effective networking on platforms and in virtual communities in social as well as in business terms. Such networking processes lead to the accumulation of social, relational and intellectual capital, as they facilitate information and knowledge exchange, integration and creation. Since information and knowledge sharing, collaboration and socialising take virtual dimensions, opportunities and threats arise for enterprises regarding relational capital management (RCM) as well as knowledge and value creation. Most new ventures are keen on utilising SM for internal and external communication and collaboration purposes. In this context, the question of how new ventures can improve their RCM through the utilisation of innovative information and communication technologies (ICT) and SM arises. To answer this question, ventures have to grasp the potential of web technologies and SM and to assess their appropriability to achieve relationship&#8209;specific goals. They need to be aware of SM risks in order to exploit chances and avert threats which arise through SM use. In this paper, the question of how to exploit the benefits of virtual embeddedness and Web 2.0 in order to optimise the RCM of new ventures is discussed. To provide a basis for this discussion, the qualities of social and relational capital and the different forms of physical and virtual embeddedness are analysed. The utilisation of SM for RCM purposes and the implementation of a SM strategy are exemplified in the case study of a German eCommerce venture that took advantage of web technologies to build up and manage its relational capital in virtual and physical dimensions. Finally, a conceptual model describing the contribution of virtual embeddedness and SM to knowledge, value and reputation creation is proposed and illustrated by means of the case study.

Authors:
Khodayar Abili
Abstract:
The importance of social capital and its effective management approach in organizations, particularly knowledge&#8209;based organizations, for assuring their ongoing and sustainable development and competitive advantage has been a matter of serious discussion in recent years. Considering the ongoing expansion and growth of knowledge&#8209;based organizations in Iran and the role and importance of their social capital in further development of Iranian society, an effective system of management of their social capital is a matter of concern of their top managers. Therefore, a blend (quantitative and qualitative) multiple case study was conducted with a selected number of knowledge&#8209;based organizations with different sizes to assess their existing social capital, to identify factors which might have positive or negative impacts on the promotion of their social capital and to propose an effective approach for its management. To conduct the study, a purposive sample of fifteen large organizations and sixteen SMEs was selected. To collect the data, a stratified random sample of 528 knowledge workers (336 from large and 192 from MEs) and their HRM managers were given a 24&#8209;item questionnaire which was designed based on three dimensions (structural, relational and cognitive) of Organizational Social Capital Model used by Nahapiet and Ghoshal in their study. This was followed by semi&#8209;structured interviews with a selected number of research participants for completion and further clarification of collected data. Findings indicated that the selected knowledge&#8209;based organizations are not benefiting from a desirable social capital. It is even worse in large organizations. Therefore, some measures need to be taken to improve the situation. Based on the findings of this study, suggestions were provided for the promotion of their social capitals and their more effective management

Developing and Implementing Strategies to Enhance Intellectual Capital in the Online Learning Environment
Pages:
pp211&#8209;220
Authors:
Bob Barrett
Abstract:
The online learning environment has become a highly competitive industry in which many stakeholders have become more interested and involved in its overall operation. One particular area that most stakeholders will agree upon is the value of human capital in this industry. Stewart (1997) classified Intellectual Capital into three key areas: human capital, structural capital, and customer capital. This paper will focus on the human capital element in the online learning environment. Human capital is explained as the capabilities of the companys employees necessary to provide solutions to customers, to innovate and to renew. As a result of changing technology and economic times, many organizations are realizing the need to update, innovate, and rejuvenate. InCaS (2010) noted that As a result of constant changes caused by globalisation, emerging technologies and shorter product life&#8209;cycles, knowledge and innovation have already become the main competitive advantages of many companies. Especially European small and medium&#8209;sized enterprises (SME) are highly dependent on the ability to identify changes in their global economic environment quickly and respond to these changes with suitable solutions. (p. 4) Just liked their European counterparts, American enterprises and organizations are scanning their environments and focusing on responding to potential changes in order to capture and maintain their market share and prepare for the future. In additional in individual capabilities, human capital includes the dynamics of an intelligent (learning) organization in a changing competitive environment, its creativity, and innovativeness (Stewart, 1997, p. 13). Thus, there has been an increase in the focus as to how online learning providers are investing more money and time in preparing their online instructional staff. Sokolowska (2006) commented that if we look at learning organizations we can see two types of trends. She stated that such organizations are understood in dynamic organizational categories that are oriented at their development, searches for new chances on the market and continually increases their effectiveness, efficiency and flexibility. The second group of learning organizations consists of such entities that choose growth through development of their employees. (p. 158) This paper examines the online learning environment, requirements for the online instructional staff, and strategies to help better prepare and develop their intellectual capital in this particular learning environment. Further, this paper will examine how these strategies are reinforced by the commitment of the educational institution in terms of preparing their online instructors, as well as mentoring them along the way.

Title:
IC and Knowledge Formation by Hidden Structures  Long Term Costs of new Technology and Participative Design
Pages:
pp221&#8209;235
Authors:
Klaus Bruno Schebesch
Abstract:
Many innovative businesses formed around energy or bio&#8209;related activities, for instance, are often the result of collective action of organisations involved in many&#8209;sided markets, which can be found in and around focusing environments such as business incubators or tech¬no¬logy centres. Within such environments, group interests beyond those of single producers and their immediate clients exist and interfere. Rather generically, important economic outcomes of innovations are se¬quen¬ces of cost reduc¬¬tion events, the pace of which is influenced by technology and networking alike. Moreover, new products or technologies are producing long term costs difficult to anticipate, which eventually, in response to private and public awareness and knowledge formation, will have to be inter¬nalized. More traditional industries like textiles rely in general on conservative business models and use new technology in rather restricted ways. Product design is fashion orien¬ted and there¬fore predominantly “artistic” in nature, distribution channels are directed towards out¬lets facilitating physical contact of clients with the produce. New technology enters main¬ly via more mechanized production cycles for a given set of narrowly defined final products. The formation of Intellectual Capital (IC) in such industries is a slow. The presence of low creativity products indicates underutilization of both new product concepts and tech¬nological possi¬bilities. Participative design procedures for new product concepts using appropriate eCommerce features point here towards a way out. Such features include well adapted recommender systems based on trust creation and opinion formation. We propose to model the effects of these long term costs of new technology and the possibly complementary effects of participative design procedures by economic agents acting within specific adaptable neighbourhoods and by formation of some trust related assets. Thereafter, the influ¬ence exerted between firms is increasing in firm similarity, in the degree of product complementarity, and it also depends on (mutual) trust relations. A sustainable innovation is more expensive than a regular one but it may lead to long term benefits and to durable competitive advantage, espe¬cially if many firms from the network collude. The associated opinion formation process which leads to sustainable innovation may be viewed as a collec¬tive cognitive process resem¬bling that of branding and re&#8209;branding. A similar trust&#8209;based opinion formation is also regarded as part of a pro¬ce¬dure for assessing the acceptance of many new or parallel product concepts as they derive from Participative design procedures anticipating future product uses. Stylized dynamic models, which entail an opinion formation process, can in turn be identified with different levels of sustainability commitment by innovating and imitating firms within a dynamic multi&#8209;firm setting. Such models tend to display the statistical behaviour of some aggregates known to occur in empirical innovative processes.

Modeling Organizational Knowledge Dynamics: Using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)

Abstract:
: Modelling Organizational Knowledge Dynamics (OKD) is important in developing knowledge strategies within the framework of strategic management. We present in this paper a new perspective on modelling OKD based on the dynamic equilibrium equation of the organizational knowledge, and on using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The dynamic equilibrium equation is considered for a time interval ∆T, and contains the following terms: the level of total organizational knowledge variation ∆K, the knowledge creation variation ∆C, the knowledge acquisition variation ∆A, and the knowledge loss variation ∆L. Since each of these terms has a different relative importance in the organizational knowledge balance, it is necessary to find a way of evaluating their weighting factors. For this purpose we use the AHP mathematical model developed by Saaty for the managerial decision making. AHP requires a structuring of the field of knowledge, and we considered a structure composed of three levels: (1) the goal level – increasing the level of organizational knowledge; (2) the strategies level – the strategy for increasing knowledge creation (S1), the strategy for increasing acquisition of new knowledge (S2), and the strategy for reducing knowledge loss (S3); (3) the activities level – hiring new valuable human resources (A1), developing training programs (A2), creating a performing motivation of employees (A3), and purchasing books, journals, software programs, and other information materials (A4). This structured model of AHP has been applied as an empirical research within a large company. We sent questionnaire to a number of 500 employees, and received valid answers from 173 respondents. The AHP method is based on paired comparisons of strategies with respect to the goal of increasing the level organizational knowledge, and then on paired comparisons of activities with respect to each strategy we defined. These paired comparisons yield matrices that lead to systems of eigenvalue equations whose solutions compose the vector of priorities for strategies, and for activities with respect to each strategy. Values of the vector of priorities for strategies are the weighting factors for the equilibrium equation components.

Abstract:
Knowledge workers represent more than half of all employees in advanced economies. In general knowledge workers are people who, when working, use their brain more than their muscles. Agricultural and industrial worlds depended on the work of manual workers and the life standard of their inhabitants and the success of agricultural and industrial organizations grew due to the increase of manual worker productivity. Existing knowledge economy depends on the work of knowledge workers and the labour productivity they can achieve. Knowledge is a major resource and tool that knowledge workers use to create values. Therefore, the way work with knowledge is organized in an organization influences the productivity of knowledge workers. This article discusses the results of research on knowledge management in organizations in the Czech Republic. This research started at the University of Economics, Prague in 2004 and continues today.

Abstract:
In this paper we show that it is possible to measure the development and management of knowledge in a country using indicators of intellectual capital that consider non visible assets not included in Gross Domestic Product. Using this idea, we obtained a measure of the intellectual capital for 72 countries selected in accordance with the information available for 2000, 2005 and 2008. These measures allows us to verify the hypothesis that knowledge acts as a divergent factor of wealth, that is, that rich countries are richer in knowledge and manage it more efficiently than poor countries. Thus, in a global economy, intellectual capital circulates in the opposite direction to development, that is, from poor to rich countries. In this sense, economic growth in developing countries displays a stronger relationship with intellectual capital. We show how national intellectual capital anticipated the economic crisis before GDP, as real GDP averages increase in all the years considered, whereas national intellectual capital decreased in last year analysed. Moreover, we used a data panel model with common coefficients to emphasize the most influential factor in the recession in order to ascertain the areas where governments must act to overcome a crisis.

Abstract:
In this paper we offered a new approach towards analysis of Intangible Assets. The conceptual framework of our research was based on taxonomy proposed by Contractor (2000) and we focused our study on intangible assets that formed uncodified human capital. The aim of this research was to discriminate the most crucial intangible assets that were absolutely indispensible in the organisational value creation. On the basis of a questionnaire tool we constructed an Information Table according to Pawlak (1982).Next we applied Rough Sets method to analyse our data. The choice of the data analysis technique was determined by numerous advantages associated with Rough Sets that were not so obvious in turn when considering traditional statistical methods. Consequently we obtained a set of intangible assets that were absolutely necessary in the organisational value creation process. This set was form by 14 different indicators that embraced aspects related to training, competencies and culture. Nearly all of them had a qualitative character. In relation to training, apart from the trainings frequency and quality, such aspects as knowledge dissemination and evaluation of the need for training were highlighted. Despite of being under in the area of Training, the aspect of cooperation was emphasized in the area of Competencies. In that section, apart from the requirement of particular knowledge necessary in each position, importance was placed on soft skills like motivation, team building and cooperation. In the area of organisational culture,  there were two elements of importance: the level of freedom when performing duties and the degree to which management attends to employees problems. Consequently, we can conclude that despite belonging to various sections, all of the crucial intangible assets stressed the absolute importance of the active participation of employees in the organisational decision making. This constitutes clear evidence of the important role of Intellectual Capital in corporate value creation.

Abstract:
Intellectual capital can be a major factor that can aid Caribbean policy makers as the region transitions from its agricultural based economy to service based economies with tourism being the largest contributor to GDP. This paper adds to the extant literature by providing literature on IC within the Caribbean and the tourism industry. Additionally, while the research has emphasized defining and measuring IC and its components, and their impact on firm’s performance theoretical questions remain concerning the synergistic, dynamic and contextual nature of IC. In addition, the use of sensemaking to provide the foundation for understanding the interaction of the IC components and firm’s performance will further enhance the IC literature. This paper reports on the development and testing of a theoretical model concerning the mediating effects of measurement of IC and sensemaking on the components of IC and performance linkage. This quantitative study used structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the model and structural relationships among the components of IC and performance mediated by sensemaking and measurement of IC. Independent variables used in the model were HC, RC and SC; with sensemaking and measurement of IC being the mediating variables and performance, a composite scale measuring managers’ perception on relative changes of their performance of financial and non&#8209;financial measures, being the dependent variable. The study shows that HC, RC and SC are related to sensemaking, that measurement of IC is associated with performance, that measurement of IC mediates the relationships between RC and performance and SC and performance, and it validates the relationship between HC and performance.

A Process View of Knowledge Management: It Aint What you do, its the way That you do it

Authors:
John Edwards
Abstract:
Knowledge management needs to consider the three related elements of people, processes and technology. Much existing work has concentrated on either people or technology, often to the exclusion of the other two elements. Yet without thinking about process  the way people, organisations and even technology actually do things  any implementation of a knowledge management initiative is at best risky, and at worst doomed to failure. This paper looks at various ways in which a process view has appeared, explicitly or implicitly, in knowledge management research and practice so far, and reflects on how more thinking about process might improve knowledge management in the future. Consistent with this overall viewpoint, the issues generally centre less on what a process view would suggest should be done, but rather on the way that it would be implemented in practice.

Abstract:
The knowledge being shared for cooperation may also be useful for competitive purposes. Whilst this situation is acknowledged, there is no through analysis of how it has been investigated and treated in prior research studies. This paper reviews the literature on simultaneous cooperative and competitive knowledge sharing. It also contributes to this area through an analytical review that compares the literature linked to this phenomenon and identifies their strengths and limitations. The analysis of the findings suggests that efforts in this area have been undertaken independently and with little consideration of the prior studies in different but related realms. The findings suggest the benefits of integrating different bodies of literature in building on a broader platform of existing epistemological and ontological foundations.

Knowledge Transfer Procedures From Consultants to Users in ERP Implementations

Authors:
Przemyslaw Lech
Abstract:
This paper focuses on the issue of knowledge transfer from consultants to the final users of the ERP system during its implementation. For a long time, the knowledge transfer has been recognized as one of the key success factors of the implementation projects of any type. Basing on the literature, two alternative approaches to the knowledge transfer were identified: an exploration oriented one, assuming users active participation in the implementation process and another one, i.e. instruction oriented knowledge transfer, depending on the users training provided by the consultants after the implementation has been completed. A study of 10 ERP implementation projects is presented to determine how enterprises solve the knowledge transfer issue in real&#8209;life environment. At the end the paper presents the evaluation of the amount of external workload from the consultants needed to accomplish the knowledge transfer process with the use of the two alternative approaches. It is based on the field study in two comparable enterprises. The main value of the research is that it presents the generalization of the knowledge transfer procedures used in real&#8209;life ERP projects and then evaluates the difference in external workload from the consultants in a very unique situation of two very similar enterprises, with comparable business processes and information requirements, and which implemented the same ERP system with help of the same external consultants but using different knowledge transfer approach.

In Search of the Golden Mean: The Ambivalence of Knowledge Explication

pp340&#8209;352
Authors:
Georg Hans Neuweg
Stefan Fothe
Abstract:
Knowledge Management (KM) tends to regard the explication of knowledge as thoroughly positive. In this paper, we argue that this attitude rests on misconceptions regarding the nature of implicit knowledge and knowledge explication. Rather than following undifferentiated imperatives to maximise the amount of explicit knowledge, practitioners of KM are better off considering the ambivalent effects of knowledge explication. For this purpose, we suggest applying the Tacit Knowing View (Neuweg, 2004) and Contingency Theory to the problem of determining the right level of explication. The paper is divided into four parts. In the first part we trace KMs need for the explication and formalisation of knowledge. In the second part, we address theoretical misconceptions. First, we apply Ryles finding that sloppy language use may lead to illegitimate assumptions toward explication. Secondly, we argue that, albeit superficial references to the work of Polanyi can be found throughout KM, actual epistemological positions rather seem to follow Popper. In the third part, we systematise limitations, problems, and side effects of explication. In the fourth part, we suggest the heuristic concept of explication optima as a framework for developing KM activities.

Abstract:
In the current advanced era, knowledge and the applications of it are the essence of organizations for achieving competing advantage and defined as a new strategic approach to innovation and a potential element for creating larger market share. Understanding the knowledge management process in terms of banking sector will highlight how it influences organizational performance. In a developing country like Iran, it is also showing signs of competition and improved performance through knowledge management; however whether the knowledge management process is practiced in Iranian banks is still to be explored. In response to this need, this research explores the key processes and technologies of knowledge management being used in the commercial banks of Iran in order to give an insight for bankers and strategist to understand its importance.

Contextual Adaptive Knowledge Visualization Environments

Abstract:
As an essential component of knowledge management systems, visualizations assist in creating, transferring and sharing knowledge in a wide range of contexts where knowledge workers need to explore, manage and get insights from tremendous volumes of data. Knowledge visualization context may incorporate any information in regard to the decisional problem context within which visualizations are applied, the visualization profiles of knowledge workers as well as their intended purposes. Due to the inherent dynamic nature, these contextual factors may cause the changing visualization requirements and difficulties in maintaining the effectiveness of a knowledge visualization when contextual changes occur. To address the contextual complexities, visualization systems to support knowledge management need to provide flexible support for the creation, manipulation, transformation and improvement of visualization solutions. Furthermore, they should be able to sense, analyze and respond to the contextual changes so as to support in maintaining the effectiveness of the solutions. In addition, they need to possess the capability to mediate between the problem and the knowledge workers through provision of action and presentation languages. However, many visualization systems tend to provide weak support for fulfilling these system requirements. They do not provide adequate flexibility for adapting the visualizations to fit different knowledge visualization contexts. This motivated us to propose and implement a flexible knowledge visualization system for better aiding knowledge creation, transfer and sharing, namely, Contextual Adaptive Visualization Environment (CAVE). CAVE provides flexible support for (1) sensing and being aware of changes in the problem, purpose and/or knowledge worker contexts, (2) interpreting the changes through relevant analysis and (3) responding to the changes through appropriate re&#8209;design and re&#8209;modelling of visual compositions to address the problem. In order to fulfil the requirements posed above, we developed and proposed conceptual models and frameworks which are further elucidated through system&#8209;oriented architectures and implementations.

Abstract:
The rapid development of virtual worlds has created new possibilities for supporting formal and informal knowledge acquisition and learning processes online. Consequently, greater immersion of “knowledge workers” in cooperation and communication tasks in social virtual worlds should be a more prominent topic in sociological and cognitive&#8209;psychological research designs. The relatively new social potential of virtual worlds can be examined using theoretical models that describe the use and assessment of virtual world technologies in contexts of knowledge acquisition and exchange. In this paper, three co&#8209;created scenarios will be described to help demonstrate how virtual worlds can be used to explore new forms of interaction in (virtual) social contexts. These scenarios and the results of the avatar&#8209;based ethnographic investigation during the process of co&#8209;creation and collaboration will be introduced and used to reflect on the 3D projects. Afterwards, two sets of criteria to evaluate 3D environments for learning and teaching will be presented. The paper ends with suggestions for further research concerning the effects of immersion during collaboration and education in virtual worlds and an outlook on other upcoming 3D projects.

Abstract:
Nowadays knowledge is becoming an increasingly important factor of organizational competitiveness. The way it is shared within the organization is essential and central not only to the success of organizations but also among those who share it, since those who take part in the knowledge sharing process also benefit from it. Since middle managers have an important position within the organization and play a significant role in the knowledge sharing process, this paper focuses on the knowledge sharing of those middle managers who work at medium and large&#8209;sized enterprises in Hungary. A new method of how to measure middle managers’ maturity of knowledge sharing is presented in this paper. Between 2007 and 2010 an empirical survey was conducted during which 400 middle managers working at medium&#8209; and large&#8209;sized enterprises in Hungary were investigated by a questionnaire. The answers of this survey have been analysed using Principal Component Analysis and four different principal components concerning the maturity of knowledge sharing have been identified. These four components are the availability among middle managers, the availability among the middle managers and their subordinates, the usefulness of knowledge among middle managers and the usefulness of knowledge among the middle managers and their subordinates.

Understanding Personal Knowledge Development in Online Learning Environments: An Instrument for Measuring Externalisation, Combination and Internalisation
Pages:
pp39&#8209;47
Authors:
Markus Haag

Abstract:
This paper investigates personal knowledge development in online learning environments using the perspective of a model adapted from Nonaka and colleagues’ SECI model. To this end, the SECI model, which was originally designed to describe organisational knowledge creation and conversion, was adapted to conceptualise personal knowledge development in online learning at the individual level. As the SECI model was originally conceived at the organisational level, in order to measure personal knowledge development at the individual level in the context of online learning, a measurement instrument was created in order to measure the scores of individual online learners on Externalisation, Combination and Internalisation. It is argued that Socialisation is not a relevant mode in the context of online learning and is therefore not covered in the measurement instrument; this is explained further in the paper. This measurement instrument also examines the interrelationships between the three modes and a new model – the so&#8209;called EC&#8209;I model – is proposed to depict these interrelationships. The measurement instrument is based on data collected through an online survey, in which online learners report on their experiences of personal knowledge development in online learning environments. In other words, the instrument measures the magnitude of online learners’ Externalisation and Combination activities as well as their level of Internalisation, i.e. the outcomes of their personal knowledge development in online learning. For Externalisation and Combination, formative indicators were used, whereas for Internalisation reflective indicators were used. The measurement instrument is one of the main foci of this paper and is therefore discussed in&#8209;depth. In sum, the paper proposes a modified version of the SECI model, extending the applicability of the original SECI model from the organisational to the individual level. It outlines a new measurement instrument which can be used to measure Externalisation and Combination, i.e. personal knowledge development processes, and Internalisation, i.e. personal knowledge development outcomes.

Abstract:
An organisation’s ability to successfully compete in a changing market place is contingent on its ability to manage what it knows, in order to serve the objectives of the firm. While it has been argued that due to their size, knowledge management (KM) is not a concern for smaller organisations, in the current economic climate, it is expected that a more formalised approach to KM allows the company to seize opportunities as they arise, and deal with environmental uncertainty more effectively. In view of this, the objective of this study was to devise a classification of knowledge activities (KAs) which facilitates the exploration of a Small to Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) in terms of the type and extent to which knowledge is managed.  Furthermore, analysis of KAs provided a greater understanding of the fit between the firm’s objectives and the KM approach pursued. In order to achieve this, five case studies were conducted. Based on the classification of KAs identified, a qualitative analysis approach was used to code each of the twenty eight interviews carried out.  Both quantitative and qualitative content analysis methods were applied to facilitate data reduction and generate meaning from the significant volume of data collected. The output from this study includes a classification of KAs which provides rich insight into how SMEs are motivated to deal with knowledge as a means of achieving their organisational objectives. From a practitioner viewpoint, this study seeks to offer an improved understanding of a software SMEs’ approach to KM.

Abstract:
Knowledge&#8209;oriented organizations are bricks for the knowledge&#8209;based society construction. Building knowledge&#8209;based society and economy suppose challenging transition processes from the classical structure of an organization to new organizational forms that help to fill the gap between actual society and the future knowledge&#8209;based society and economy. This transition generates new issues in knowledge creation and sharing processes, related to the particularities of the new organizational forms. Therefore, in the last few years, our researches are oriented to developing and testing a number of forms of organization designed to facilitate an efficient and effective transition toward the knowledge&#8209;based society, like communities of practice, (virtual) networks of professionals or knowledge ecosystems (KE). Under this general frame, this paper presents the results of our research aiming to capture the necessary changes that a medical organization specialized in rehabilitation (the National Institute of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine from Bucharest, Romania &#8209; INRMFB) has to undertake for converting its classical structure into a new knowledge&#8209;oriented one, possible and easily to being integrated into a Virtual Network for Home Health Rehabilitation of the impaired people – the meta goal of our research in recent years. Specifically, within its five sections, the paper outlines: 1. An introduction in the macro and micro&#8209;level empirical setting in which the study is carried out; 2. The methodological approach based on Social Network Analysis (SNA). Although quit often used in the medical field, as we will see in the second section of the paper, the SNA methods and models aren’t used yet in the particular area of health rehabilitation; 3. The objectives of the empirical study that can be summarized as follows: Mapping of the knowledge flows & needs in the target community of practice. The aim of this step is to produce an accurate picture of the knowledge flows that the target community identified at the INRMFB actually enacts in the accomplishment of its organizational objectives. Analysis & Diagnosis: Identification of critical aspects and areas of improvements (e.g. knowledge needs, knowledge bottlenecks, structural determinants of inefficiency or of poor performance). Design: definition of the functional specifications for redesigning the agents, network and of the functionalities of Knowbots. 4. The survey we have designed for data collection. According with the particularities of the macro and micro&#8209;level in which our study is carried out, we have designed a survey that will help us both for diagnosing the knowledge&#8209;sharing&#8209;structure of INRMFB, and for finding adequate solutions for potential critical aspects identified in this medical facility.; 5. A set of conclusions and recommendations for the new knowledge&#8209;oriented organizational structure to be created within the INRMFB. Alongside with performing SNA in the health rehabilitation field, an important output of our study is to find answer to the following questions: Cans the classical organizational structure of the INRMFB be transformed into a knowledge&#8209;based one, by reengineering the knowledge flows and agent’s roles? If and where within the actual structure a virtual knowledge agent (knowbot) can and should be integrated? Our paper is a consequent continuation of our work in the KE area, contributing to the completion of an integrate vision over the role of the KM techniques, human and virtual agents in the emerging of knowledge&#8209;based society. It presents a work still in progress, the final results of our study going to be presented within the ECKM2011 conference.

Knowledge Management Practices and Healthcare Delivery: A Contingency Framework

Abstract:
Being a knowledge driven process, healthcare delivery provides opportunity to incorporate knowledge management practices to improve processes. But it has also been noted that knowledge management is systematically more complex in healthcare and minimal research exist to guide academic and organizational stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the application and impact of knowledge management practices in healthcare delivery. The paper is conceptual in its nature and aims to propose a contingency&#8209;based framework to drive further empirical research. The paper is primarily based on a literature review of the healthcare knowledge management and associated information sciences research streams. The fundamental research questions are: ‘‘what and how do the various knowledge management practices affect the performance of healthcare delivery?’’ and ‘‘what are the contingent and contextual factors that needs to be considered when exploring the relationship between knowledge management practices and performance of healthcare delivery?’’ We first discuss facets of performance in healthcare delivery but thereafter focus on the technical and interpersonal care aspects of healthcare delivery.  We investigate knowledge management practices in the areas of (i) knowledge acquisition and sharing, (ii) knowledge assimilation and application. In our paper we explore how the different knowledge management practices affect the performance of healthcare delivery through technical and interpersonal care. Thereafter we explore the factors of physician characteristic, ailment characteristics, organizational IT infrastructure and organization processes, on which the conceptual framework will be contingent on. We thereafter evaluate the conceptual framework with a case study. From an academic perspective our paper identifies some key knowledge management practices and explores their linkages with technical and interpersonal care, while from a practical point of view it provides implications for administrators and practitioners in healthcare delivery on the management of contingency factors so that the knowledge management practices can be properly implemented.

Abstract:
Knowledge sharing and creation are considered key processes leading to innovation and organizational performance. Several organizational initiatives have focused on building communities of practice in order to create a platform where employees can share experiences and insights. The focus in this paper is on one type of network structure, termed distributed networks of knowledge (DNoK). The success of such practices is deeply linked to whether or not formalization of the networks can hamper their knowledge creation and creativity. The role of leadership has been extensively discussed in the setting of communities of practice. However, this paper intends to shed new light on the topic by exploring the boundary management perspective in order to enable knowledge sharing and creation within this specific context of DNoK. To this end, we have examined the role of leadership styles in different DNoKs in a multinational firm.

The Potential of Neuro&#8209;Linguistic Programming in Human Capital Development
Pages:
pp131&#8209;141
Authors:
Eric Kong
Abstract:
Human capital (HC) represents the cumulative tacit knowledge that is embedded in the minds of people in organisations. HC is important to organisations because it serves as a source of innovation and strategic renewal. Individuals carry HC when they join an organisation and take their talent, skills and tacit knowledge with them when they leave the organisation. Thus HC is volatile in nature. Organisations are therefore keen to do what they can to foster and develop HC as a means of achieving sustainable competitive advantage. This paper argues that neuro&#8209;linguistic programming (NLP) has the potential of developing and enhancing the stock of HC in organisations. NLP emerged in the 1970s from the University of California, USA. NLP suggests that subjective experience is encoded in terms of three main representation systems: visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic (VAK). NLP practitioners claim that people tend to have one preferred representation system over another in a given context. Despite that previous research has shown that NLP can assist in facilitating knowledge and learning capabilities, very limited research is conducted using NLP in nurturing HC in organisations. This paper critically reviews the literature and theoretically argues that NLP can be used as a practical approach to develop HC in organisations. This is because NLP primarily focuses on individual internal learning and that learning likely leads to the accumulation of HC in organisations. In other words, organisational members may find it more effective to enhance their tacit knowledge, both individually and collectively, if they adopt the NLP approach in their day&#8209;to&#8209;day work. Examples on how NLP may be used to develop HC in organisations will be provided. Future research direction and limitations will also be discussed.

How to Characterize Professional Gestures to Operate Tacit Know&#8209;How Transfer?

Abstract:
Operational knowledge in industries is difficult to capture because of the tacit nature of gestures. Our experiments showed that the operators can be equipped with video capture devices. Professional workers can also be invited to describe the intentions of their gesture. But the bottleneck is in the gesture itself. This paper describes an experiment, which was performed at EDF (Electricité de France), the French leader energy producer company. Several categories of professional gestures were studied and were investigated to produce training video material called “MAP” (Multimedia Apprenticeship Platform). The capture protocol aims to collect operators’ intentions, their mental models. An anthropocentric three&#8209;step methodology was applied. For all the gestures, six descriptors were used to qualify the environment and the capture situation: (A) the realism of the situation, (B) the length of the gesture, (C) the shooting area size, (D) thought and decision&#8209;making of the operator, (E) the operator’s ability to gaze available information and (F) the operator’s ability to search for information in the environment. A three&#8209;value scale is used for each descriptor to quantify the criticism of the gestures. Results include the perimeter of application of the MAP methodology, describing professional gestures which can be captured, formalized and transmitted. The majority of the descriptors have a moderated influence on the process, concentrating their impact on one point of the method. Two parts of the professional gesture have high&#8209;level impact on the whole process: (1) the visual component of the gesture to use available information or to search pertinent information in the environment, and (2) the time devoted to interaction between operators or to think and make decision during the realization of the professional gesture.

Ya-Hui Ling
Abstract:
: A main purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of intellectual capital and intellectual capital complementarity on a firm’s global initiatives. Sample was selected with a type of purposive sampling. The selection criteria were that companies had to locate in Taiwan, but competing globally. Altogether 324 firms took part in the study. Structural Equation Modelling technique was used in the data analysis. Based on the analyses results, some implications are provided. Firstly, the importance of intellectual capital is again highlighted. It is confirmed that intellectual capital does enhance a firm’s global initiatives. Secondly, some moderating effects of business environment are found between intellectual capital and global initiatives. Thirdly, the important role of intellectual capital complementarity is identified. It is found that intellectual capital complementarity has positive effect on global initiatives in both high dynamic and low dynamic contexts. As a result, the value of intellectual capital components can mostly be actualized only in terms of their dynamic interrelationships and conjoint interaction.

Abstract:
: Agriculture must evolve into a more environmentally&#8209;friendly approach while remaining economically workable. This type of agriculture is said to be sustainable. It has a systemic logic and therefore requires a strong knowledge base. In this study we propose a knowledge management IT&#8209;based system. In the first part of our article, we discuss the potential actors of the system and their possible implications. The second part deals with the knowledge selection and formalization. The third part describes the main computing features of the knowledge server we propose.

Title:
Five grounded Principles for Developing Knowledge Management Systems
Pages:

Authors:

Abstract:
The practice of developing knowledge management systems in organizations is hindered by a lack of research into (a) what is a knowledge management system, (b) how to develop a knowledge management system in practice, and (c) what role (if any) information technology should play in supporting a knowledge management system. Hence the use of ad hoc, proprietary approaches by practitioners. This paper addresses this gap in research and in practice by presenting five principles from a set of 12 that that emerged through a grounded theory study of the practice of developing knowledge management systems in organizations. The paper focuses on how each of the principles (i) emerged from, and was validated in, evidence collected from developing knowledge management systems, (ii) is connected to related work in the literature, and (iii) informs the practice of developing knowledge management systems. The principles have fundamental implications for the practice and research of developing knowledge management systems in an organizational context. In practice, the principles offer practitioners useful insights into developing knowledge management systems in a way that delivers value to organizations. In research, the principles address several problematic aspects of the literature, particularly concerning divergence, fragmentation and inconsistencies in definitions for knowledge management systems, the purpose for developing knowledge management systems and the role of IT in supporting knowledge management systems. Furthermore, the paper helps distinguish between information systems, which are often used in knowledge management and knowledge management systems whose characteristics, according to the principles presented are very different.

Abstract:
This paper is the final phase of a larger research project that investigates knowledge transfer in global supply chains from the perspective of South East Asian reseller companies. In a previous study a theoretical model for knowledge transfer in global supply chains was developed and quantitatively validated for the case of Thai resellers of laboratory equipment where equipment resale companies (donors) provide training to their customers (recipients). Results from that previous study indicated that the transfer capability was the most important issue for the donor firms. Furthermore, the most critical factor for the recipient firms was their absorptive capacity in the form of certain capabilities for the successful utilization of the technical knowledge received from the donor firms. By adopting a qualitative sense&#8209;making research approach and a two&#8209;round focus group interview method for data collection and analysis the current study attempts to provide further deeper explanations for the results of previous quantitative survey. Five participants were chosen for two&#8209;round of focus group meetings for this purpose.

Abstract:
IC is alive and well yet still seeking relevanceJohn DumayIntellectual Capital is alive and well across Europe and of course the rest of the world. I feel I obliged to make this opening remark to this special edition (SE) of the EJKM because of my recent experiences, not only at the ECIC 2012 conference, but also my subsequent travel experiences to the other parts of Europe, Asia and Australia I have visited already this year. So far this year I have presented papers on IC at four conferences, five research seminars at different Universities, a practitioner presentation for the Hong Kong Knowledge Management Society and a workshop for an international bank’s KM interest group. Each of these presentations has been well attended and I have had the opportunity to meet and answer questions about IC from students to practitioners and eminent professors. On top of this I am currently visiting at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University where I have met the likes of Stephen Selby who managed the what I would consider to the largest IC project involving SMEs in Asia  if not the world along with Prof. Rongbin Lee and his IC research team which is part of the Knowledge Management Research Centre at Hong Kong Polytechnic . IC is truly alive and well.The international interest in IC is also reflected in the origins and nationalities of the authors and settings of the papers included in this SE. Included here is an eclectic mix of papers from the Caribbean (Carrington and Tayles, 2012), Switzerland (Eggs, 2012), Germany and China (Fritzsche, 2012), Italy and USA (Massaro et al., 2012), Romania (Suciu et al., 2012)and Poland with international overtones (Wiśniewski, 2012) and not to forget an editor who is based in Australia. This is important because IC is not just a local phenomenon because it touches individual organisations right through to nations themselves (see Lin and Edvinsson, 2009). So while the papers have an international flavour they also reflect the growing trend to investigate IC from a practice perspective (Guthrie et al., 2012) with five of the six papers in the SE being base on single or multiple case studies. Investigating IC from this perspective is important because IC has been criticised for being stuck at a metaphorical crossroads of relevance (Chatzkel, 2004) and what is needed are actual examples showing both academics and practioners how IC can be utilised and how it makes a difference.From these five papers two papers focus on the development of “trust” as part of IC (Eggs, 2012; Suciu et al., 2012) a theme which has been central to several previous IC papers (Moeller, 2009; Dumay and Lu, 2010; Reychav and Sharkie, 2010). In the Eggs (2012) paper a case study about how to build trust in a online Community of Practice (CoP) is presented using an IC lens. The paper finds that while technology is an important enabler of IC and CoP attention must be paid to how the technology is deployed and that “needs must drive the technology” rather than technology driving solutions. I think this is important for IC practitioners not only from the technological perspective but from the IC practice perspective because all too often IC practices are seen as “solutions in search of a cause” (Andriessen, 2004, p. 230) rather than being used to resolve problems in organisations using a different lens. The paper is also important because it deals with building trust in an online environment whereby people need to trust the technology as well as the people they interact with through the likes of social media which is these days becoming a ubiquitous form of communication and collaboration. In the second “trust” paper, Suciu et al. (2012) offer a theoretical framework linking “trust, culture, reputation and intellectual capital”. Utilising research performed in the Romanian tertiary education sector using qualitative and quantitative data. As a result of their study they find that “there is an observable cycle in the formation of intellectual capital, where trust, cooperation, reputation, innovation and creativity are the triggers and fuel at the same time”. This is very much in line with my own thinking of how IC is created because of the additive nature of IC and intangible resources (Andriessen, 2006, p. 103) and that socially constructed concepts, such as IC, have duality of structure (see Giddens, 1984), meaning their inputs become their outputs which in then become the new inputs. This allows for people to “become involved, rather than just the accountants, managers and stakeholders who understand the meaning of ... IC” (Dumay, 2008, p. 12). As Suciu et al. (2012) elaborate it then becomes the “job of the company management staff to establish achievable objectives ... and to make sure they follow through” because IC just doesn’t happen on its own, it needs to be enabled by people.Moving from the theme of “trust” to the involvement of “people” is the paper by Fritzsche (2012) who presents a case study based on research at German and Chinese car manufacturers to investigate how people make decisions involving IC between what Fritzsche (2012) identifies as the modes “of potentiality and actuality”. This is an important distinction between how people actually theorise about IC and put IC into practice because often we think about the potential of IC (what are IC’s benefits) and may not later be able to determine what IC has actually done for our organisation. However, Fritzsche (2012) identifies that it is important to make decisions about IC from both perspectives. If we consider the how IC is linked to strategy then it makes sense to involve considerations about the potentiality of IC while later we should then measure the actual impact of IC. The benefit for us as practitioners is that we have a wide variety of IC accounting tools (frameworks) at our disposal (see Sveiby, 2010; and Dumay and Roslender, forthcoming) which “allows an adaptation to the requirements of the given situation” (Fritzsche, 2012). I also believe this is important because as I have discovered in my own research it allows managers to choose the IC tools best suited to resolving managerial problems (Dumay, 2008) and deal with ambiguity (Dumay and Cuganesan, 2011). There isn’t just one right IC tool (framework) for every situation (see Dumay, 2009, for a critique).The fact is IC is a tool that is utilised by many of us in our research and practice and I suspect that nearly every person who is reading this paper for the first time has some understanding of what IC is if not a reasonably in depth knowledge.  Often I believe that when we attend conferences such as ECIC we are preaching to the converted. As a colleague recently wrote in an email that “I find [IC] not being practiced by managers far as much as it’s being preached by us academics…” Thus examining how IC is involved inside particular industries and how we might be able to get the message across to managers who may not have heard of IC is to my mind useful and important. This is the approach taken in the paper by Carrington and Tayles (2012) who present two case studies exploring “the relevance and awareness of IC in two hotel chains in the Caribbean”. The major outcome of their study showed that there was no formal recognition of IC however there were many relevant management practices at the hotels which suggested that IC was present. This is along the same argument of Ordóñez de Pablos (2003, p. 62) who outlined that while today we (us IC academics) call it IC and think it is a new phenomenon for managing in the “knowledge economy” in fact we have been managing IC for some time because management topics such as “human resources, organizational development, change management, information technology, brand and reputation management, performance measurement and valuation” have collided to form IC as a conceptual framework. The Carrington and Tayles (2012) paper is important because it shows that we don’t necessarily need managers to understand what the terms intellectual, human, relational and structural capital are in order to implement practices aimed at improving these areas in the pursuit of better management and value creation.  This is important when we as “preachers” of IC roll out IC to the unconverted masses. Because if we start speaking in these terms under the assumption everyone knows what we are talking about we are likely to meet dumbfounded stares and resistance to our message. Carrington and Tayles (2012) then go on to recommend not increased reporting of IC as is commonly recommended and concluded in many IC studies but rather increased IC education “so as to enlighten them [managers]on the theoretical framework of IC and its attributes” because “managers were engaging in practices related to IC without any knowledge of its relevance and importance in developing a firm’s competitive position.” This is a position I recently discussed with Goran Roos who outlined why thinking about IC was engrained in the psyche of Scandinavian mangers because IC was taught in University courses as an integral part of managing organisational strategy. However many other parts of the word, such as the Caribbean, seem not to have caught up with this mode of thinking and had an IC enlightenment. Thus, instead of preaching to unconverted practitioners, maybe we should concentrate more on converting the educators.The last of the case study papers is by Massaro et al. (2012) who outline how the role of knowledge development though Appreciative Inquiry (see Cooperrider et al., 2005) can be integrated into Management Control Systems (MCS) for managing creative processes and innovation in organisations. They base their new framework on the levers of control model made popular by Simons (1995) in response to the changing dynamics of business in the 1990s. Their model linking MCS to the development of the creativity steps required for innovation is itself innovative and easily understood. This is important for two reasons. First, the model provides managers with a logical way in which to promote the behaviour of an organisation’s human capital towards creativity by recognising that different levers of control are required to promote different types of creative processes. Second, it recognises that the creativity process has different stages and managers need to be able to change their approaches from more formal and structured processes during the early phases of creativity to more open processes which are aligned with implementing ideas. The last paper for the special edition is as much a social commentary on the prior “frantic pace of innovation in the financial services industry” and how this has been “socially disruptive” (Wiśniewski, 2012). What I like about his paper is that is argues how innovations in the financial services industry were rampant and did not have sufficient checks and balances to ensure that  the “finacialisation” of society did not cause negative social effects. Today the world is still reeling from the impact of these failed innovations and many countries at the time I am writing this paper such as Italy, Spain and Greece are yet to realise the full ramifications. Thus a paper which openly talks about the impact of failed innovation is appropriate for this SE just as was Karl&#8209;Erik Sveiby’s keynote speech at ECIC 2012 called Challenging the Innovation Paradigm where he also questioned the so called “unquestionable” benefits of innovation whereby a pro&#8209;innovation bias always claims that innovation is a good thing (see also Sveiby et al., 2012). Reading the Wiśniewski (2012) paper confirms that this is not the case and that rampant unchecked financial innovations which fail can have deep and lasting impact on society just as failed innovations can have a detrimental effect on organisations.In line with my previous comments on the espoused benefits of IC as lauded by the “preachers” we should also be cognisant of taking a more critical stance (see Guthrie et al., 2012) and begin to question the benefits of IC by building on what is good and by recognising that there may also exist “intellectual liabilities” alongside our “intellectual assets”. Maybe a more appropriate term should be “intellectual equity” whereby we take a balanced view of the social, utility and economic value created by managing IC rather than just blindly preach only its benefits. Doing so could help overcome some of the relevance lost by our current implementation of IC practices so that one day IC will become a useful and integrated part of the way that organisations and thus society is developed and improved.

Trust Building in a virtual context: Case Study of a community of Practice

Cindy Eggs
Abstract:
The Research Management Unit of Swiss Distance University for Applied Sciences (Fernfachhochschule Schweiz  FFHS) has experienced trust building processes in virtual environment amongst others in their work with Community of Practice (CoP). The establishment of CoPs has become their core business, that means that they have have planned and implemented such kind of learning communities for international companies and for university groups. According to the author, CoPs are perceived as laboratory for creating intellectual capital for which trust building is a pre&#8209;conditioned success factor. To identify trust building methods in a research environment in particular and in CoPs in general, using new technologies is the main aim in this paper. So, the broad subject CoP and intellectual capital will be constricted and the focus put on trust. A special focus is put on the virtuality element which has become very important with the raise of social media platforms in the business world. Following questions will be addressed in the paper: How is trust defined in a virtual environment, especially among researchers? How can you build trust in a CoP? How can the community leader influence this trust building? What is the role of different group members? Which influence does a deep organizational trust have on the success of a community?  To answer this question, foremost a theoretical analyses model for trust and its processes will be developed based on the three domains of intellectual capital which most authors have identified for the division of intellectual capital: human capital, structural capital and relationship capital. To cope with the technical dimension of virtuality, a new approach to the intellectual capital domains is elaborated. In the first place, at the level of human capital, the author describes personal characteristics and competencies (knowledge management skills) which enable trust building. Secondly, the level of structural capital focuses on technical aspect of the community and activities which foster trust building. Last but not least, the relationship level studies the trust building process linked to different roles and a new collaborative culture. As a case study for this paper, serves the community of researchers at the FFHS which collaborate through a virtual platform called eDolphin. The researchers, working for a future&#8209;oriented institution and eUniversity, come from different disciplines and promote an eLearning and eCollaboration approach in team activities and project management. The findings of the theoretical approach lead to its adaptation to the practical example of eDolphin. How was trust build in this case? What are the lessons learned which we identified during this community building process.  Last but not least, some theories and findings concerning community building on social media platforms are described.

Intellectual Capital, trust, cultural traits and reputation in the Romanian education system

Abstract:
The contemporary approach to the concept of intellectual capital has transformed. The three components (human, relational and organizational capital) are not enough to reflect reality, as the static perspective was replaced by an integrative vision: intangible resources, actions and process that contribute to sustainable competitive advantage. However, this theoretical division provides solid ground for explaining the close bond between trust, cultural identity and cooperation, soft concepts, and intellectual capital in knowledge&#8209;based organizations. Therefore, we consider it is of high interest to identify the nature of the relational and organizational capital, and trust association. Is it first trust and then the two intellectual capital components, or the other way around? Also, we can take one step further and consider the intellectual capital formation process and architectural scheme behind it. This paper aims firstly at offering a theoretical framework for the liaisons between the concepts previously mentioned and intellectual capital, underlying specific characteristics for the Romanian educational system, especially for tertiary /higher education. The second objective is to provide new research directions, comparing the findings with situations of other cultures, like Japan and USA. The research methodology comprises a thorough literature review of scientific studies and of the 2011 National Romanian Education Law. It focuses on the changes and challenges for the intellectual capital formation phase. Also, it involves an empirical investigation of an evaluation of the current intellectual capital formation route. The research instrument is a questionnaire, collecting information for both quantitative and qualitative research purposes. The findings of this paper seek to identify the structure and dynamics of the intellectual capital formation process in the Romanian higher education system. As well, we hope to lead to concrete solutions for improving general dynamics, and acknowledgment of trust, cooperation and cultural aspects as corner stones in education intellectual capital formation area.

Title:
Implicit Evaluations of Intellectual Capital in Practical Decision Making

pp236&#8209;243
Authors:
Albrecht Fritzsche
Abstract:
A lot of the confusion about the measurability of intellectual capital can be explained by a neglect of the difference between an object, the capital it provides, and the profit from the application of this capital. An analysis of this difference leads to the distinction between the potential of intellectual capital for economic process and its actual realization. Case studies from different areas of managerial practice show that decision making about intellectual capital considers it both in the mode of potentiality and actuality. However, the level to which the difference of modality is made explicit varies a lot. Talent management and network planning tend to minimize reflections about potentiality. This is possible because these reflections are an implicit part of the preceding activities in the company that provide the basis for the decision situation. In intellectual property management, decision makers have more freedom to consider the further potential of the capital in question. In the application of different methods to evaluate intellectual capital, it therefore seems important to look for a strong consistency between the way how actuality and potentiality are taken into consideration by the structure of the business practice and the approach of the method.

Abstract:
This paper explores the relevance and awareness of IC in two hotel chains in the Caribbean. A qualitative exploratory case study method was used to gain an in&#8209;depth understanding of the constructs relating to IC within indigenous Caribbean hotels. The data collection procedures employed were documentation, archival records and twenty interviews with top managers. Content analysis was used as the major technique for analyzing the data. The major finding is that there is no formal recognition of the construct of IC, but the embedded practices within the organisations suggested the presence of such.  The data clustering and analysis of the evidence suggested two themes for HC &#8209;personal competencies and human resource praxes; three themes for RC &#8209; customer capital, brand and community capital; and three themes for SC &#8209; information systems, innovation and organization.  The case studies further revealed that the chains had embedded human resource practices and well established customer relationship management systems which created linkages among the components of IC.

Organizations require an intensive knowledge integration mechanism that supports creativity within all the phases of its process in order to analyze, understand, select, and integrate ideas into a business model. Management Control Systems, as a part of the structural capital, can be utilized as knowledge integration mechanisms to provide: i) a dialog among internal or external actors of the creative process; ii) a knowledge repository for data and other information required in the selecting process; iii) representation of the new ideas into a business model. Using a multi&#8209;method case study, this article analyzes the role of knowledge integration played by Management Control Systems (MCS). Within the perspective of the Levers of Control (Simons, 1995), MCS are recognized as the sum of belief, boundary, diagnostic and interactive systems that could be used to manage the creative process. We apply the Appreciative Inquiry model of creativity (Cooperrider, Srivastva, 1987) which recognizes four steps: Discovery, Dream, Design, and Destiny. Creativity is then classified based on the problem's characteristic using Unsworth's model (2001) which separates closed and open problems. Results show that in the early phases of the creativity process problems are more structured  and are faced using diagnostic and boundary tools. In the design phase, a dynamic tension between interactive and diagnostic systems is always preferred. The final phase (Destiny) requires diagnostic approaches in all cases. On this foundation, the paper aims to contribute to the literature on innovation and intangible assets. It is our opinion that the results could also be used by managers and entrepreneurs involved in the creative process in order to improve a companies ability to face change.

Authors:
Piotr Wiśniewski
Abstract:
Financial companies worldwide are blamed for having precipitated the gravest global economic meltdown since the Great Depression of the 1930s. While the aftershocks of the last turmoil are still palpable and some observers prophesy that another sharp economic downturn might be in the offing  global policymakers, analysts, researchers and the public at large ruminate how to redress the balance of powers to ensure socially sustainable financial and macroeconomic growth. This paper reviews the expansion of worldwide financial industries relative to real economies (financialisation), exemplifies its social ramifications and indentifies the root causes of socially disruptive innovation undertaken in financial institutions. Finally, the paper highlights the prerequisites of social equilibria in financial organisations, of which most are endogenous in nature.

Abstract:
Web 2.0 and Social Software revolutionize the knowledge exchange within and between organizations. This is one of the claims consultants and software vendors in the field have made. But have the promises been kept and has evidence been achieved so far, in particular for knowledge management in globally distributed settings? As a starting point, our paper introduces the field of Global Social Knowledge Management (GSKM). We see this area as one of the main research area for future research in the Knowledge Management domain. A variety of social software applications have already been seen promising and incorporated into the context of knowledge management (Avram 2006; Zheng and Zheng 2010; Levy 2009). One main assumption is that social software could bridge the traditional gap between human&#8209; and technology orientation (Avram 2006:1; Fiedler & Welpe 2011). However, there is so far only anecdotal evidence how these applications work in globally distributed organizational settings. Within this paper, we present the key issues for GSKM and elaborate on transferability of these aspects to differing contexts. The main research domains related to GSKM are Social Software and Global Knowledge Management. We present a brief review of state of the art research for these domains and focus in detail on Social Software supported knowledge activities. As one of the first efforts, we perform a mapping of Social Software to KM activities and major barriers. Additionally, we will illustrate through a case study how to contextualize the GSKM approach for educational application area. The paper is a starting point for discourse on this promising field, outlining the research field of globally distributed Social Software&#8209;supported Knowledge Management and discussing current research efforts on the main components. By this paper we intend to contribute towards a research agenda for Global Social Knowledge Management.

Knowledge Dynamics Analysis in Negotiations

Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to present some research results we obtained in analysing knowledge dynamics during negotiation processes. For knowledge dynamics we use the semantic spectrum currently used in thermodynamics, through a metaphorical interface. In our view knowledge dynamics means complex transformations from one form of knowledge into another form of knowledge. In our research we considered the dyad containing cognitive knowledge and emotional knowledge, in the Nonaka’s oneness perspective. Cognitive knowledge is represented by the explicit or the rational knowledge. Emotional knowledge is represented by the result of processing our sensory information and integrating it into the non&#8209;rational mind. Similar to energy, knowledge can be found in organizations and society in different forms: explicit knowledge, implicit knowledge, tacit knowledge, emotional knowledge, spiritual knowledge, symbolic knowledge. Our hypothesis is that one form of knowledge can be transformed into another form in a given Ba. Our research focused on iterative transformations of cognitive knowledge into emotional knowledge and of emotional knowledge into cognitive knowledge during negotiation processes. We designed and performed 28 experiments of simulated negotiations between an experienced negotiator and different individuals without any training in negotiations. The duration of each experiment was about 20 minutes. We videotaped all of these experiments obtaining about 9 hours of recorded negotiations. There were basically two types of negotiations: a) a typical trade negotiation, and b) a typical salary negotiation. Based on a well designed script, the experienced negotiator sent different cognitive and emotional messages to the would be employee, who has been asked to answer using both written and verbal answers. In the same time we recorded his expressions that reflected the emotional answer. By analysing the induced messages and the cognitive and emotional answers for each participant we got interesting results concerning the knowledge dynamics in the negotiation processes.

Can Family Firms Innovate? Sharing Internal Knowledge From a Social Capital Perspective

Abstract:
Many studies focus their analysis on the effects of knowledge management on the development of organizational innovations. Innovation is posited, in this paper, to be a managerial priority that facilitates the creation of competitive advantage. The data, information and knowledge that contribute to innovation processes are available in social capital. Social capital is understood as the networks, norms and trust that enable participants to act together more effectively to pursue shared objectives (Putnam, 1993). From this foundation, we argue that the effectiveness of these networks can be determined by whether the personnel who interact perceive the relationship to be worthwhile, equitable, productive and satisfying. Only individuals can apply their own experience and contextual understanding to interpret the details and implications of a particular situation in order to determine what is the appropriate action or actions to take. Internal social capital enhances the ability of members within a firm to know who to contact for relevant knowledge. This means that internal social capital facilitates the development of innovation through the acquisition of knowledge from internal and external networks. However, there are some problems in family firms. The utilization of internal capital does not guarantee that appropriate information is used in appropriate circumstances or that information is appropriately updated (De Holan and Phillips, 2004). The influence of the family on the company may inhibit or foster the exploitation of this knowledge. In this context, we try to test the influence of social capital on innovation on family firms.  We develop a measure of the extent of family control of family companies – familiness – and examine the moderator role of this variable in the relationship between social capital and product innovation. The results of our empirical study of 282 family firms show that social capital has a positive relationship with product innovation. That is, the active connections among people – “the trust, mutual understanding, shared values and behaviors that bind the members of human networks and communities and make cooperative action possible” (Cohen and Prusak, 2001) – allow companies to generate innovations. Second, we also found that familiness plays a moderator role in the relationship between social capital and innovation. In this case, we have found that cultural dimension of familiness positively moderates the relationship between social capital and innovation.

Abstract:
Knowledge resides within a human being and it is hard to be transferred to others. Unwillingness to share is one of the main impediments of knowledge sharing. In a university setting, this situation could be more alarming as universities are knowledge centric organisation. Knowledge sharing will help universities to strengthen its research and teaching activities. Despite the importance of knowledge sharing, many academics still hoard their knowledge. The aims for this paper are (1) to evaluate the influence of these two emotional factors towards knowledge sharing intention; (2) to examine whether the perception of knowledge sharing in public universities differs from private universities. The research model includes the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the two affective components. In order to examine the research model, a survey was conducted with a total respondent of 545 academics from 30 universities in Malaysia. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the research model. On the other hand, t&#8209;test was used to examine the differences between public and private universities. In general, the findings revealed that emotional influence is crucial for knowledge sharing behaviour. The t&#8209;test analysis shows that there are significant differences between public and private universities. This paper contributes to the existing literature by evaluating the impact of emotional factors (affective commitment and affective trust) towards knowledge sharing behaviour. It also provides a greater depth of understanding on how knowledge sharing in public universities deviate from private universities. University administrators need to implement policies and activities to strengthen the emotional bonding between academics in order to facilitate knowledge sharing in Malaysian universities. This is exceptionally crucial for private universities as the results shows that knowledge sharing intention is lower than the public universities.

Abstract:
This paper analyses the nature of the impact of learning on the adoption of information technologies (IT) and vice versa in the naval sector. It is necessary for a shipyard to acquire new knowledge, distribute it, interpret it, and store it enabling the use of Information Technologies by internal and external agents. For this reason, a model must be found in order to examine the impact of IT on the codification of knowledge considering external agents (customers, suppliers and retired personnel) and internal agents (engineers, workers and managers) in the shipyard. The authors investigate the implementation of IT through a learning process in the naval industry through a case study. The authors collected data through interviews and presented a model depicting linkages between agents of a shipyard organization (customer, suppliers, engineers, workers, directors), knowledge&#8209;related processes (codification, storage, reutilization) and benefits. Following discussion of the model, authors conclude that acquiring external knowledge is beneficial and facilitating interactions between agents increases the benefits for the shipyard organization. In the study it is possible to appreciate that acquiring and distributing knowledge from external agents is a previous step to the codification of this knowledge using Technological tools. Only considering this sequence, it is guaranteed a knowledge update by internal agents in the shipyard. During the last few years the naval industry has been modernized in defence matters and a lot of money has been spent in IT. That is why it is necessary to assess the use of IT and learning in this sector as well as to analyse the knowledge learning process and systematisation used in the naval industry during the different phases required for construction. Finally, the results have implications for managers of the shipyard when they make a choice as to the organizational capabilities to target in order to ensure the effective adoption of IT.

Authors:
Jamie O’Brien
Abstract:
The primary aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a robust Knowledge Assessment Framework (KAF). The development of a KAF is important for organisations for three reasons. Firstly, the use of knowledge assessment allows firms to pinpoint knowledge gaps. Secondly, it allows firms to manage knowledge more effectively. Thirdly, it gives organisations a diagnostic tool with which to gauge their knowledge base. The effective management of knowledge can be considered a competency that enables a greater level of service to be extracted from other resources within the organisation. The results of this study highlight several points for organisations interested in understanding their knowledge base. The analysis moved beyond simply looking at the framework itself and offers some interesting insights.

Abstract:
This is my first editorial, as I have just recently become the editor of the Electronic Journal of Knowledge Management, following a long period as a paper reviewer. I feel very honoured to be able to contribute to the continued success of our journal at a challenging time for the KM discipline.  While the field has evolved significantly since its emergence in the early 1990s and attracted a high level of interest across both the academic and the practitioner communities, any comprehensive review of recent publications across the discipline might produce some sense of déjà vu, as many are concerned that limited progress is being made in the broader recognition of the discipline in the academic community and in the adoption of good KM practices.

Governing Frameworks for Sharing Actionable Knowledge
Pages:
pp127&#8209;138
Authors:
David Johnson
Abstract:
A fundamental necessity for the transfer of actionable knowledge is that it must occur within a context. This essay suggests that governing frameworks provide the medium within which it becomes possible to share actionable knowledge. To support this claim the notion of governing frames is first explicated. Frameworks provide the basic support structures for sharing knowledge within organizations through the development of an inextricable linkage between context and meaning often found in the underlying foundation for governance structures. Each of the classic governing frameworks discussed, formal, informal, markets, and professional, has different manifestations of key structural elements, relationships, elements, context, configurations, and temporal stability and thus different implications for sharing knowledge.   The strengths and weakness of the various frameworks for understanding the sharing of knowledge in organizations are exemplified by focusing on two exemplar problems:  information seeking and clinical and translational science. In conclusion, the concept of governing frameworks offers a new way of looking at the often intractable problem of sharing knowledge in our ever more complex organizations. A compelling focus of future research is how these frameworks are negotiated in an increasingly professionalized world where specialists must integrate their activities in interprofessional teams.

Abstract:
Abstract: The aim of the present is to verify the degree of applicability of the financial valuation method developed by Rodríguez&#8209;Castellanos et al. (2006a, 2007) for the valuation of real option&#8209;based intangibles in the Spanish region of the Basque Country. The field study consisted on a telephone survey of CFOs in a random sample of Basque Country’s firms, selected using segmentation criteria based on size and business sector. Considering the 517 replies received it is stated that, despite three of every four CFOs answering that options were included in their intangibles, approximately one of every five is actually capable of identifying such options. When we consider the difficulties encountered in estimating the model’s parameters, the conclusion is that less than 10% of the region’s firms are likely to be in a position to directly apply the method proposed for the valuation of real option&#8209;based intangibles, which means a preliminary phase of analysis and diagnosis is required before the method can actually be applied in practice. The present paper makes a substantial contribution because it’s the first study that tries to verify the utility of a method for the financial valuation of intangible resources to take into account the associated real options. It could be useful from an academic and managerial point of view.

Measuring Innovation in Agricultural Firms: A Methodological Approach

Abstract:
Abstract: Measuring innovation is a notoriously difficult task. Agricultural firms present additional complications due to the complexities and uncertainties linked to the sector. Among the increasing literature available on innovation, there is plenty of information about innovation measurement in manufacturing industries, but scarce contributions for the case of agricultural  firms. Currently there is no concerted and/or published methodology for innovations measurement for such firms. This research proposes a methodology for measuring innovation and its key determinants in agricultural firms, based on three main tools. The first one is the Innovation Matrix (IM), an approach to a structured catalogue of the technology in the agricultural subsector under study. IM includes information about innovation technological level, in terms of its place on the technological spectrum of the subsector. IM also includes information about the frequency of innovation, which refers to the degree of adoption of a particular innovation among the farmers. The second tool is the Innovation Index (II), a single number that combines information about the technological level and frequency of the observed innovations. The basic idea of II is to assign higher values to firms that implement either less frequent or comparatively advanced innovations, relative to the ones implemented by its competitors. Since II is always a real non&#8209;negative number, it is possible to use OLS estimation procedures  (third tool) to enquire about the factors driving innovation processes in agricultural firms. We have applied this methodology to four agricultural subsectors in Colombia. The II results reveal relatively small values for most of the surveyed producers. At the same time, they provide evidence to support the claim that there are just a few innovative leaders in every chain. In general, the factors determining innovation are subsector&#8209;specific, but there are still some general stylized facts for the whole agricultural sector. The main consequence of this finding is that innovation policy design for the agricultural sector must take into account the existence of both sectorial (common) and subsector (specific) factors.

Abstract:
Abstract: In 2001 Kent State University established a graduate level program that granted a Master of Science degree in Information Architecture and Knowledge Management. The Knowledge Management concentration was a cornerstone of that degree program. The Knowledge Management concentration has sustained and thrived over the past ten years, though the path has not always been easy or clear. This case study describes the challenges encountered and the solutions developed over the past ten years. The case study discusses nineteen challenges and their solutions, in hopes that other institutions may benefit from Kent State University’s lessons learned and successes. The case study highlights issues that arise as an academic program matures, including: curriculum development and design, administrative support and alignment, faculty credentials and credibility, and research support.

Title:
Unfolding the Gordian Knot of the University Intellectual Capital

Abstract:
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the Gordian Knot of the intellectual capital of the universities is the structural capital, and that unfolding it requires a deep understanding of the nature of structural capital This idea comes from a new perspective on the intellectual capital structure and on the relative importance of each component of it, i.e. human capital, structural capital and relational capital. Many authors consider that the human capital is the most important and by far the dominant component of the intellectual capital of the universities. Our research based on the new concept of organizational intellectual capital integrators showed that a university may have a great potential of the intellectual capital based on the human capital component, and yet not to perform competitively due to the weak integrators and stiff structural capital. In our view, an integrator is a powerful field of forces capable of combining two or more elements into a new entity, based on interdependence and synergy. These elements may have a physical or virtual nature, and they must posses the capacity of interacting in a controlled way. For any university these integrators have an intngible nature. The interdependence property is necessary for combining all elements into a system. The synergy property makes it possible to generate an extra energy or power from the working system. It makes the difference between a linear system and a nonlinear one. The Gordian Knot of the intellectual capital of universities is the structural capital. Only understanding the nature and the complexity of the structural capital we will be able to understand the full potential of the intellectual capital metaphor. Thus, the structural capital is the key component of the university intellectual capital and it is strongly related to the concepts of university governance and university autonomy. This paper is based on a conceptual research, a search of the literature, and on a solid experience one of the authors has got in the legislation and management of the university system of Romania, as a former General Director for Higher Education in the Ministry of Education and Research.

Title:
The Value of Human Resources Measurement in Intellectual Capital and Knowledge sharing

Abstract:
Abstract: It is recognised and accepted by business leaders and academic scholars alike that people (human resources) are an organisation’s most critical assets in the contemporary knowledge economy. While this may be true, this rhetoric is often not matched by the reality of employment practices related to this important yet ambiguous resource.  The purpose of this paper is to review the current situation with respect to the question of people as valuable resources in the intellectual capital and knowledge management paradigms. Our contention is that human resources pivotal  to the success of modern business enterprises, irrespective of their sizes. This paper’s empirical basis is achieved by presenting research data made by the authors on the relationship between psychosocial variables and human resource practices on behaviours associated with intellectual capital and knowledge sharing. A positive relationship has been found between attitudes, subjective norms, and self&#8209;efficacy on knowledge sharing behaviour. Besides this, a positive correlation was found between the concept of psychological capital and knowledge sharing. With respect to human resource practices, the paper includes a review of research undertaken on management’s perception on the importance of measuring human resources, some organisations’ attempts to achieve this, and the current barriers towards the measurement of value. Current research on the relationship of knowledge sharing and human resource practices is presented. The paper concludes with a discussion on the authors’ observations of the value of human resources in the current state of the theoretical and practical considerations of intellectual capital and knowledge sharing, and their suggestions on a way forward in this developing area of ICKM.

Tacit Knowledge, its Codification and Technological Advancement

Authors:
Nowshade Kabir
Abstract:
Abstract: The paper addresses issues related to the confusion surrounding conceptual understanding of tacit knowledge and its transferability in organization's realm from an original perspective. Lately, at every level: country, industry and organization, attention to knowledge has intensified due to the realization that in "post&#8209;capitalist society" (Drucker, 1993) knowledge is increasingly replacing traditional driving forces of economy: labor, capital and natural resources as the primary factor in economic growth.  Knowledge use is now considered as imperative in all aspects of an organization. In literature there exist various typologies of knowledge, however, in organizational science most common classifications of knowledge include two general types: tacit and explicit. This paper brings clarity to the concept of tacit knowledge, nexus between tacit and explicit knowledge and effects of advances in technologies on the codification capability of tacit knowledge. It argues that many types of tacit knowledge that were considered as inexplicable just recently thanks to new technologies have become transferable. Drawing examples from knowledge science literature the author questions the rigid belief of some scholars in ineffability of tacit knowledge. The author also claims that organizations need to reassess their knowledge related strategy, particularly, in relation to tacit knowledge if they would like to develop sustainable competitive advantage from effective knowledge use. Findings: The author shows how new technologies are changing our perception of tacit knowledge and why it is time for organizations to reevaluate their knowledge strategy. Originality/Value:  By showing a clear correlation between technological advancement and tacit knowledge transformability the paper contributes to the theoretical understanding of tacit knowledge.

Trust as Intangible Asset &#8209; Enabling Intellectual Capital Development by Leadership for Vitality and Innovativeness
Pages:
pp244&#8209;255
Authors:
Taina Savolainen
Palmira Lopez-Fresno
Abstract:
Abstract: Trust has become an essential intangible asset in organizations and leadership. Trust promotes social order and cooperation in workplace relationships. It is a resource that creates vitality and enables innovativeness. The paper discusses and examines the highly timely topic of trust from the human intellectual capital (HIC) perspective. More specifically, the focus is on the role trust plays in renewing intellectual capital by leadership. In the paper, trust is viewed in a relational context describing the positive expectations of a respectful human behaviour. Originality of the paper is based on the two ideas of both theoretical and practical significance. First, exploring and conceptualizing trust as intangible asset, resource and skill in organizations. Second, examining how trust in leadership enables HIC development and how it affects. The paper provides a novel view into managing intangibles, since trust as intellectual resource and a leadership skill in relation to HIC development have hardly been examined integrated. The main point highlights the importance of leadership by trust in enabling the growth and utilization of HIC. The paper advocates the idea that, in managing knowledge, it is important to increase understanding of the interaction among different aspects of KM. The value intangible assets, such as trust, add to human resource development (HRD) is multiple and still poorly understood. The paper presents also two real life case studies of how leadership by trust enables vitality and innovativeness in organizations. The case studies examine the sharing of tacit knowledge and co&#8209;creation with customers.

How to Innovate Management Through Intellectual Capital Statements &#8209; Lessons Learned From the First Implementations in Brazil

Abstract:
Abstract: Recent initiatives have shown that it is time to think about new ways of managing companies, particularly in emerging economies. Mertins et al (2012), points out that, “In the rapidly emerging Brazilian economy, intangible assets become a key success factor for sustainable growth”. As experiences in the fast moving city and state of Rio de Janeiro have shown, the development of systematic management procedures for these intangible assets is especially valuable for fast growing small and medium&#8209;sized enterprises (SMEs) in order to serve as a solid backbone for an increasingly knowledge&#8209;based economy.  Another initiative described by Sequeira et al (2012) highlights that Brazil has been evolving into a knowledge society dealing with political changes, globalization, new technologies, and new global competitors, such as China. The need to enhance companies´ and, by extension, countries´ competitiveness has grown rapidly. It is, therefore, evident that organisations and particularly government policies need to redress some critical competitiveness issues, most notably the establishment of the Competitive Intelligence System as a strategic tool. Without such tool, organisations and the country will find it difficult to position themselves within the global marketplace. Taking into account the main conclusions of the two initiatives described above, and the unique circumstances of organically grown organizations in the Brazilian business environment, this paper discusses the challenge of integrating the Intellectual Capital Statement &#8209; ICS into a comprehensive strategic change process. In order to promote sustainable business development in an emerging economy, the ICS has to be used to establish a continuous improvement cycle in the individual company, focusing on practical actions for maintaining and developing its intangible assets to ensure future competition capability.

Abstract:
Abstract: Knowledge transfer is a real challenge for organizations and particularly for those who have based their strategy on knowledge codification using knowledge engineering methods. These organizations are facing one major problem: their knowledge repository is used by few persons. Why? In this article, we identify barriers for transfer and appropriation of codified knowledge referential. We show that codified knowledge transfer should be a specific collaborative process taking into account three aspects: complexity and specificity of codified knowledge, readers’ profiles, and exchange channels. Then, we propose to improve knowledge transfer process by developing new specifications for the codified knowledge to increase its transferability and by elaborating a pertinent shared context for knowledge interpretation. It is an empirical methodology which optimizes continuity between knowledge codification and knowledge transfer.

An Empirical Study on the Impact of the Process of Measuring IC on Performance

Authors:
Donley Carrington
Abstract:
Abstract: This paper explores the relevance and importance of measurement of IC and its impact on performance in the Caribbean hospitality industry.  A survey using a 7&#8209;point Likert scale was administered to hotel managers to test the relationship between measurement of IC and performance controlling for hotel size and rating of the hotel. The data analysis techniques used were exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and hierarchical multiple regression. The analysis of hierarchical multiple regressions allowed us to support the hypothesis that measurement of IC explained a significant additional proportion of variance in performance above and beyond that of number of hotel rooms and hotel ranking.  This finding of a significant and positive relationship between measurement of IC and performance has relevance to both IC academics and practitioners, as it validates the use of measurement of IC to enhance performance. This paper adds to the extant literature on IC within the Caribbean and the hospitality industry both under&#8209;research areas in terms of IC.

Pedro Figueroa Dorrego et al
Abstract:
Abstract: At a time when intellectual capital and product innovation management are both considered to be critical for companies to gain a competitive edge (and even survive) in todays unstable business environment, this paper discusses the influence of relational capital on product innovation performance at innovative small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Building upon the intellectual capital and new product development perspectives, an empirical research was conducted, using a questionnaire administered to a network of Portuguese innovative SMEs. The findings suggest that relational capital does have a positive effect on product innovation performance. In particular, Vertical relationships emerges as the main relational capital element significantly affecting product innovation at the innovative SMEs level. The existence and proactive management of relationships with customers and suppliers emerge as critical factors to product innovation success. We find our results to be useful for both researchers and practitioners: we contribute to the ongoing understanding of relational capitals impact on critical business phenomena, while also identifying additional critical factors for new product development success.

Authors:
Harold Harlow
Abstract:
Abstract: Developing intellectual capital at companies often results in large numbers of patents filed with little results other than protection of firm historical patents against intellectual property intrusion by current competitors or future competitors. This paper presents exploratory  research to classify into those patents filed in past years by several major technology companies as well as measuring the business results of the patents which shows the need for the new strategic conceptual model presented in this paper. A new approach to align corporate resources toward patent  strategies, management capability and process with strategic intent is presented which enables firms to assure that all needed considerations are present in a comprehensive technology and patent strategy of intellectual capital  development, especially at technology firms.

Voluntary Disclosure of Intellectual Assets and Intellectual Liabilities: Impact on Financial Performance in Publicly Listed Firms in the United Arab Emirates

pp325&#8209;338
Authors:

Abstract:
Abstract: Financial reporting is an important, crucial task for achieving and sustaining a well&#8209;organized, farsighted business. Furthermore, investor demand for relevant information and improved quality and timeliness of financial information is increasing in the face of deteriorating usefulness of traditionally reported earnings, cash flows, and equity values. Thus, many accounting industry practitioners, analysts, and researchers now see Intellectual Capital (IC) as a driver for a firms long term business competitiveness. However, most IC studies have overlooked the negative side of IC which is referred to as Intellectual Liabilities (IL). Therefore, the objective of the present research is to explore through empirical analysis how Intellectual Assets (IA) and IL components, as independent variables, influence Firm Financial Performance (FFP) as a dependent variable. The present study uses content analysis of 2010 and 2011 annual reports for all publicly listed companies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Multivariate regression analysis is employed to answer the research question: What are the characteristics of a new conceptual model that assists in explaining the relationships between IC disclosure and FFP for companies listed on the UAE stock exchanges? The findings indicate a statistically positive relationship between Human Assets (HA), Relational Assets (RA), Structural Assets (SA), Human Liabilities (HL), Relational Liabilities (RL), and Structural Liabilities (RL) on one hand, and Return on Equity (ROE) on the other hand. However, this research has some limitations which include the restrictions inherent in the content analysis method, in addition to the external validity to other jurisdictions due to the sample being chosen from the UAE only. In terms of practical implications, the findings of this study provide an insight to firm managers on the impact of increased transparency and disclosure on FFP.

Abstract:
Abstract: Intellectual capital has become a key element of the knowledge economy. Their management is a factor that influences the competitive advantage of companies. The main objective of this paper is to present a methodology (ICM &#8209; Intellectual Capital Model) that allows the audit of intellectual capital management in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). From the conducted research, it can be concluded that the model is technically robust and determines that the management of intellectual capital is likely to be audited and certified in order to control the quality and dynamism of the knowledge generated and allowing the partner organizations (customers, suppliers and enders) to estimate the innovation capacity and verify the conformity of their management parameters, compared with a reference standard. Indeed, the results of surveys also show that the proposed model forms the basis of a credible accreditation system for intellectual capital management in the majority of Portuguese SMEs. This paper also contributes to enhance the discussion around the value of organizations intangible assets and therefore to change the current concepts of economic development.

Abstract:
Abstract: This research study focuses on innovation and the Human, Structural, and Relational components of Intellectual Capital, using Santos&#8209;Rodrigues et al. (2011) research proposal as a framework.  It aims to investigate the influence of Intellectual Capital on a public Healthcare organisations capability for innovation. Sixty five of the sixty eight questionnaires administered to hospital managers and leaders between July and August of 2011, were used in the research. The study suggests that a relationship exists between the incentives to innovate (a dimension of Human Capital) and the innovation created, with trust being the only Structural Capital dimension related with the innovation adopted.  It was found that networks and alliances (a dimension of Relational Capital), is the only dimension simultaneously related with the innovation created and adopted constructs, hence, Relational Capital being the only Intellectual Capital construct related simultaneously with both innovation creation and adoption. The research further suggests that there is a direct relation between Human Capital and innovation, principally with the innovation created. The Structural Capital construct was found to be partly related with the Innovation Adoption construct.

ICBS Intellectual Capital Benchmarking System: A Practical Methodology for Successful Strategy Formulation in the Knowledge Economy
Pages:
pp373&#8209;386
Authors:
José Viedma Marti
Abstract:
Abstract: The advent of the knowledge economy fundamentally changes the way to create wealth. According to new theoretical foundations (Resource Based View, Dynamic Capabilities and Knowledge Based View) key strategic knowledge or Intellectual Capital has become the fundamental driver of wealth creation. A revision of the literature concludes that business excellence has always been due to good strategy formulation and superior strategy implementation. In order to achieve business excellence in the knowledge economy context substantial efforts have been made to improve the process of strategy implementation and some of them have produced relevant frameworks and methodologies, such as Balanced Scorecard and InCaS (Intellectual Capital Statement. Made in Europe). Nevertheless, fewer efforts have been made in the process of strategy formulation and, in practice, the SWOT analysis still is the most well known existing framework. However, in a world where customer preferences are volatile and the identity of customers and the technologies for serving them are changing, a market&#8209;focused strategy may not provide the stability and constancy of direction needed as a foundation for long term strategy. When the external environment is in a state of flux, the firm itself, in terms of its bundle of resources and capabilities, may be a much more stable basis on which to define its identity. Hence, a definition of the firm in terms of what it is capable of doing may offer a more durable basis for strategy than a definition based upon the needs the business seeks to satisfy. Consequently, the SWOT analysis methodology can⠒t cope with the new external environment requirements and a kind of improved or extended SWOT analysis is needed. ICBS (Intellectual Capital Benchmarking System) is the output of a practical research on extended or improved SWOT analysis, a framework that knowledge economy requires for successful strategy formulation. ICBS is a new management method that allows companies to perform a competitiveness strategy check&#8209;up of their business models. F

Abstract:
Abstract: If a company aims to succeed at developing its competitive advantage, knowledge assets should be considered as an important resource as it is the raw material from which financial results are obtained. This Case Study aims to determine whether human Capital is presented and valuated in a small company working in the logistics sector, and if it has an impact on the financial performance. Considering this, we have developed a Case Study that utilises a pragmatic and unique, holistic and exploratory approach. Data collection was carried out mainly through interviews and observation centred on Human Capital and on the financial performance, conducted on two elements from different levels of authority and responsibility within the company, a director and an operation employee. A Likert scale of 5 points was used, and the study concluded that both participants interviewed, shared a similar point of view about Human Capital and the financial performance. It was also concluded that the company evaluated is human Capital, in particular, the follow elements: the employees formation and training, skills, teamwork, internal relations and knowledge share had impact in the financial performance of a firm, and the company had a positive result over the years, although yields have stagnated recently, and expenses have increased due to the current international crisis. Consequently, it was concluded that in those companies, Human Capital was valuated and the case study suggests that there is a relationship with financial performance.

Cross&#8209;cultural Validation of UTAUT: The Case of University VLEs in Jordan, Russia and the UK
Pages:
pp25&#8209;34
Authors:
Boyka Simeonova et al
Abstract:
Abstract: Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) are learning platforms within universities aiming to facilitate and enhance students’ learning. In order to increase the chances for success of VLEs implementation it is essential to identify the factors which influence the students’ decision making as far as accepting and using VLEs are concerned. In this paper we are applying one of the most popular models, the so&#8209;called Uniﬁed Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model developed by Venkatesh et al. (2003) to identify and test the underlying factors influencing VLE acceptance and use. UTAUT is a relatively new model sparsely applied in cross&#8209;cultural settings and in the context of Higher Education (Straub, 2009). We are testing the model in four business schools in universities in three different countries: the UK, Russia and Jordan. The results show that although all items from the original UTAUT questionnaire have their place in the final groupings obtained through the factor analysis, the ‘clean’ agglomeration of items into groups shown by the original paper and a few others could not be replicated in the individual countries or in the overall sample despite the good sample size obtained in our study. The paper raises a question about the replicability of the original results and calls for reconsideration of the way the model is applied.

Business Innovative Environment as a Prerequisite for a Long&#8209;run Competitive Advantage

Abstract:
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to highlight the importance of innovation in businesses. It tries to illustrate the way companies could invest in lifelong learning focusing on the entrepreneurship education in order to support creativity and innovation as prerequisite for a short&#8209;run increase in their profits and mostly for a long&#8209;run sustainable competitive advantage. In the first part of the paper, we will focus on companies. In some companies the manager is thinking how creativity could help. One person may generate 10 ideas; conversely, 5 persons may generate 50 ideas. From those 50 ideas the manager can use at least 3 of them to increase the profit. This is how intellectual capital and creativity should be enhanced. Furthermore, it will influence the consumers buying renewed products in a more profitable way. The second part of the paper, we will highlight the importance of taking into account some best practices cases. Nowadays, with Internet banking, Euro Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) and credit cards, the final user has been granted options for the monetary transactions. People like consumers want their needs to be satisfied and this is one of the reasons why they have grown accustomed to demanding more and more from their banking services providers. In the last part of the paper, we will discuss about the creativity models and ways in which these models might influence the workers and the leaders to come up with new ideas, be creative and generate larger profit. From a methodological point of view we applied both the quantitative method (surveys) and the qualitative one (in terms of focus&#8209;groups & interviews).

Abstract:
Abstract: Today, innovation is considered one of the main source of competitive advantage for the companies. For multinationals companies (MCNs) innovation is particularly important because they have more challenges to face than domestic organizations. MNCs have also a potential advantage for developing innovations, as they have access to new ideas and knowledge generating in the different locations they operate in. But this potential advantage can only become real if MNCs are able to transfer the knowledge they acquire in one of their locations to the others. This paper analyses the relationship between knowledge transfer and innovation in MNCs. In particular, this research focuses on knowledge transfer from the subsidiaries to the headquarters (reverse knowledge transfer). In addition, this paper studies the effect of the firm´s learning orientation as a mediator in the relation between reverse knowledge transfer and innovation. These relationships are tested using a sample of 104 Spanish MNCs. Our findings show that reverse knowledge influences indirectly on the headquarters’ innovation through its effect on the firm’s learning orientation. These findings have implications for both academics and practitioners.

Taking a Different View: The Case of the Eurozone Macroeconomic Policies as a Case of Incompetence
Pages:
pp56&#8209;66
Authors:
Eduardo Tomé
Abstract:
Abstract: This paper aims at shedding a new and different light over a very big problem that actually is being felt by the European Society and by the world at large: namely the difficulties the EU is having, since adopting the EURO as a currency in 2002, with its own management of macroeconomic policies, and with its own forecasts over growth. We follow Sveiby (2012) analysis as a methodology. According to that author, radical innovation generates incompetence due to inability in adjusting to the environment. The incompetence materializes itself in wrong predictions by otherwise and formerly competent and acknowledged experts. Sveiby 2012, dissects the case of the financial crisis of 2007&#8209;8, as a case in which radical innovation in the financial markets produced massive managerial incompetence with huge economic and social consequences. By the same token we assume that the Eurozone became a case of incompetence at the level of macroeconomic management. We show evidence of that incompetence because we compare the predictions before the Euro and with the Euro and analyze the impact the Euro entrance add in the correctness of the experts’ predictions. Furthermore we say that experts should take into account that macroeconomic restrictions posed by the Eurozone regulations deeply affect the economy of the more divergent Eurozone Member States. Moreover, the effect of the regulations has not been rightly accounted. The miscalculation generates mistakes in prediction of policy impacts. Those mistakes have major negative effects in the life of ordinary citizens. Therefore we believe that if ones assumes, as we do, and prove, that the Eurozone has currently a problem of managerial incompetence, the finding might have huge economic, social, and political effects The paper is original because we sincerely don’t know (and believe it is not our fault) of any study that analyzes the problem of the current Macroeconomic crisis in the EU as a problem of incompetence. Finally we believe the study could and should developed in a multidisciplinary and multi&#8209;country book.

Middle Management Knowledge by Possession and Position: A Panoptic Examination of Individual Knowledge Sharing Influences
Pages:
pp67&#8209;82
Authors:
Sally Eaves
Abstract:
Abstract: This paper elucidates the spectra of influences that impact the intra&#8209;organisational tacit and explicit knowledge sharing behaviour of the middle line, a boundary spanning layer highly capable to influence, inform and transform. The approach addresses a deficiency in research that affords an eclectic perspective across both knowledge types simultaneously and at an individual level of analysis. Advancing Ipe’s (2003) conceptual work, the Multidimensional Model of Individual Knowledge Sharing Influences integrates robust and multi&#8209;disciplinary theoretical exposition with empirical validation in four leading UK Communication Sector operators. The model encapsulates the direct influence factors of Motivation to Share, Nature of Knowledge, Opportunity to Share, Culture and the Nature of the Individual. Organisational Velocity provides an original conceptualisation of the continual, episodic and ambiguous change that reflects reality in many post&#8209;industrial settings and is expressed as the tension between centrifugal and centripetal forces acting on the other factors. All six dimensions are shown to impact individual knowledge sharing practice, with underexplored constructs such as personality traits and aspects of demography emerging as significant. Organisational Velocity can operate in a moderating and primarily centrifugal capacity on Motivation to Share, Opportunities to Share and the Nature of the Individual. The study demonstrates that a panoptic, pluralistic and interdisciplinary perspective combining human, social, technological and contextual factors must be considered to understand sharing behaviour and optimise knowledge management interventions. A particular element may not be evaluated in isolation. Further, when factor dynamics are sub&#8209;optimum, the middle line may pragmatically orientate towards personal knowledge management mechanisms. Evidence of hoarding, hiding or disengagement from sharing is identified with some managers electing to utilise their knowledge in possession and network positional opportunity to generate rent in alignment with individual and affiliated group interests, negating its aggregation for wider organisational benefit. Implications for research and practice are fully explored.

A Holistic View of the Knowledge Life Cycle: The Knowledge Management Cycle (KMC) Model
Pages:
pp85&#8209;97
Authors:
Max Evans

Catalin Bidian
Abstract:
Abstract: As more companies implement knowledge management (KM), they require a practical and coherent strategy and practice anchored in a valid and comprehensive KM life cycle model or framework. Using a knowledge&#8209;based view, this paper aims to improve how firms conceptualize, strategize, and manage organizational knowledge. The paper opens with an analysis of organizational knowledge and knowledge assets. Appropriate conceptualization and partitioning of knowledge is required since the cost, benefit, and imitability of knowledge assets largely depend on their form. Subsequently, the paper provides a historical and chronological overview of some of the most influential KM life cycle models, based on their scholarly adoption and frequency of use by practitioners. Each represents an advance in the thinking concerning the KM life cycle and introduces valuable new elements to be considered in understanding how organizational knowledge is processed throughout its useful lifespan. Life cycle models examined include Wiig (1993), Meyer and Zack (1999), Bukowitz and Williams (1999), and McElroy (2003). Dalkirs (2005) integrated life cycle model and Heisigs (2009) examination of 160 KM frameworks are also reviewed for their contribution. Building on these models and prior work by Evans and Ali (2013), the Knowledge Management Cycle (KMC) model is proposed. Finally, sample KM initiatives, activities, and technologies are mapped to the seven non&#8209;sequential KMC model phases (i.e., identify, store, share, use, learn, improve, and create) to illustrate its practical use. The main contribution of the KMC model is that it provides a holistic view of the knowledge life cycle, by building on previous life cycles models and Heisigs (2009) analysis of KM frameworks. It further extends previous models by including different knowledge forms, integrating the notion of second order or double loop learning, and associating some facilitating initiatives and technologies for each of its phases.

ADIIEA: An Organizational Learning Model for Business Management and Innovation
Pages:
pp98&#8209;107
Authors:
John Lewis
Abstract:
Abstract: This paper introduces the Innate Lesson Cycle (ADIIEA) as a uniting and integrated framework for business process operations and organizational learning. Thus far, the Knowledge Management (KM) and Organizational Learning (OL) movements have tried to teach OL to organizations as an add&#8209;on while assuming that current business models are sound. Instead, we find that current business models are based on industrial age factory process work, and fail to keep up with the learning and innovation demands of the knowledge economy. This paper suggests that these current business models be replaced, not complimented, with a learning&#8209;based model. In the epistemological formulation of this learning model, ADIIEA is compared with the SECI model, and its underlying assumptions about tacit and explicit knowledge as appropriate foundational underpinnings are challenged. Instead of a noun approach to knowledge foundations (tacit and explicit knowledge), a verb approach (questioning, reflective, and reactive modes) to knowledge foundations is illustrated to be appropriately compared to required business process operations. Additionally, this approach is shown to be epistemologically aligned with the fundamental symbols of language, where we universally find the question mark, period, and exclamation point, respectfully. From this verb&#8209;based foundation, several applications of ADIIEA are then illustrated to address current issues found in education, business processes, policy&#8209;making, and knowledge systems.

Big Data and Knowledge Management: Establishing a Conceptual Foundation

Authors:

Helen Rothberg
Abstract:
Abstract:  The fields of knowledge management and intellectual capital have always distinguished between data, information, and knowledge.  One of the basic concepts of the field is that knowledge goes beyond a mere collection of data or information, including know&#8209;how based on some degree of reflection.  Another core idea is that intellectual capital, as a field, deals with valuable organizational assets which, while not formal enough to rate a designation as intellectual property, still deserve the attention of managers.  Intellectual capital is valuable enough to be identified, managed, and protected, perhaps granting competitive advantage in the marketplace. So what do we make of current trends related to big data, business intelligence, business analytics, cloud computing, and related topics?  Organizations are finding value in basic data and information as well.  How does this trend square with the way we conceptualize intellectual capital and value it? This paper will work through the accepted literature concerning knowledge management (KM) and intellectual capital (IC) to develop a view of big data that fits with existing theory.  As noted, knowledge management and intellectual capital have both recognized data and information though generally as non&#8209;value precursors of valuable knowledge assets.  In establishing the conceptual foundation of big data as an additional valuable knowledge asset (or at least a valuable asset closely related to knowledge), we can begin to make a case for applying intellectual capital metrics and knowledge management tools to data assets.  We can, so to speak, bring big data and business analytics into the KM/IC fold. In developing this theoretical foundation, familiar concepts such as tacit and explicit knowledge, learning, and others can be deployed to increase our understanding.  As a result, we believe we can help the field better understand the idea of big data and how it relates to knowledge assets as well as provide a justification for bringing proven knowledge management strategies and tools to bear on bi

Abstract:
Abstract: Intellectual capital (IC) and knowledge sharing (KS) are key elements for fostering firm value, especially in knowledge&#8209;intensive firms. Management Control Systems (MCSs) have been recognized as key knowledge integrators. Recently, this assumption has been called into question as there may exist negative and destructive effects in both IC and KS fostered by a misuse of MCSs. Through a case study of 'Engineering Ltd.", this paper examines the 'dark side' issues associated by improperly implementing knowledge sharing and by imposing rules and constraints on behavior. The subject of our study, Engineering Ltd. , is a consultancy company with 10,000 employees. The case study is used to scrutinize the major risks of knowledge sharing and to introduce possible solutions.

The Learning Journey of IC Missionaries: Intuition, control and value creation

Abstract:
Abstract: The utilization of intellectual capital (IC) has often not been taken up as much as the proponents of IC may have wished. As Dumay (2012) outlines, there are barriers to implementing IC in organizations, and as academics and practitioners we need to overcome these barriers. We propose one way to do this is by providing reflective narratives of the journey the authors have taken as a successful IC practitioner and a successful IC academic. Based on constructivist learning theory (Chiucchi, 2013a) we offer a staged model of IC development (Guthrie et al., 2012) outlining how we went through similar stages in personally understanding and deploying IC. To do this, Mary Adams and John Dumay trace their IC learning journey in three stages of intuition, control and value creation. This paper contributes to the IC literature by providing an understanding of the growth a person may need to take in order to become an IC Missionary, rather than merely an IC preacher (Dumay, 2013, p. 8). If this can be achieved, we can provide a forum for open conversations about the concept of IC and the tools available so we can empower people and organizations to experience and collaborate to develop their own IC.

Working Meetings &#8209; a Tool for Building or Destroying Trust in knowledge Creation and Sharing

pp137&#8209;143
Authors:
Palmira Lopez-Fresno
Taina Savolainen
Abstract:
Abstract: This paper discusses and examines the role of working meetings as a tool for building and destroying trust in knowledge sharing and creation. Working meetings are one of the basic tools in organizations for collaboration and group cohesion, and a significant vehicle for communication. They play an important role in information and knowledge sharing, knowledge creation, coordination, decision making, problem solving and strengthening of group relationships inside and outside the organization, and contribute to build or destroy trust. Trust is manifested in commitment, open communication, ethical behaviour, predictability and doing the best in any activity. It creates openness and freedom at the individual and group level, so it plays an important role in knowledge sharing and knowledge creation. But as necessary and important working meetings are, they are also very costly and frequently unproductive.Unless properly managed, they can be a waste of valuable financial and emotional resources, with negative impact on organizational performance, culture, innovativeness and overall competitiveness. Good meeting planning, preparation, realization, assessment and follow&#8209;up are needed to achieve meeting effectiveness. Meeting facilitators, as leaders, play a critical role to create a positive&#8209;trustworthy atmosphere and conduct and manage the meetings with effectiveness. The main point of discussion is crystallized in the suggestion that meetings have an impact in integrative group behaviour, cooperation and knowledge sharing and creation. Building and maintaining trust are of utmost importance in it, to develop human capital for sustaining vitality and competitiveness in organizations. Originality of the paper is based on exploring the role of working meetings in relation to trust building for knowledge creation and sharing. Implications are made of how to

Abstract:
Abstract:  This study examined the extent to which learners in vocational technical institutions, capture, distribute, network and effectively use information made available to them during and after lectures that are entrepreneurially and skill oriented in order to furnish the labour market with relevant school products. Development of an entrepreneurial skill is capable of equipping the Nigerian students to fit into different aspects of the economy after graduation. The study adopted a descriptive design. A twenty&#8209;item unstructured questionnaire was used to assess  150  randomly selected final year students⠒ capacity to transform ideas gained in class into creative problem&#8209;solving strategies in  three vocational technical colleges in Lagos in south west Nigeria. Three research questions and one hypothesis were used as guides to the study. Data obtained were analyzed using descriptive statistics Pearson Product Moment Correlation. The major findings revealed that there is a significant relationship between knowledge management and the development of entrepreneurial skills among vocational technical students in the area of knowledge gathering, sharing, networking and students⠒ capacity to translate some curriculum elements into the world of work among others. Given the importance of knowledge sharing, creativity, innovations and connectivity through networking in today⠒s competitive world of work, it was recommended that students be linked up with several entrepreneurs who serve as mentors to students during and after training.  Students should be made to participate in seminars and workshops that are entrepreneurially oriented. There should also be regular visits of students to small cottage industries in the form of field trips. Vocational and Technical Institutions should establish an appropriate culture that encourages students to create and share knowledge within and outside the school. There should be a collaborative effort between vocational institutions and some government agencies, for example⠒ Small and Medium Entrepreneurial Devel

Abstract: There is a growing recognition to the importance in using online communities of practice (COPs) as a model for teacher's professional development and as a knowledge management platform.  The objective of this research was to examine factors that promote or discourage school teachers knowledge sharing intention in their online professional community. The finding of the research provides empirical support for the overall structure theorized in the research model. Knowledge sharing intention was predicted by teachers attitude towards knowledge sharing, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control. The teachers perceptions of reciprocity, extrinsic rewards were positively associated with attitude towards knowledge sharing. The perceptions of loss of knowledge power had a negative effect on the attitude. Organizational climate positively influenced teachers subjective norm. Additionally, facilitating tools and technology was positively associated with high levels of perceived behavioral control towards knowledge sharing. Based on the findings, the study discussed implications for the theory and practice

Abstract:
Abstract: The construction industry suffers from an incomplete knowledge flow that leads to overrun cost and time. A considerable portion of this problem is attributable to the design stage which is a tacit knowledge&#8209;dominated area. Since knowledge tacitness results in an incomplete knowledge flow, we posit that adding the knowledge flows beside the workflow of the architectural conceptual design phase can attenuate both the overrunning cost and time. In order to fulfill such an objective, we integrated the Nissen multidimensional model  the knowledge flow theory for the enterprise life cycle  with Macmillans framework  the conceptual design framework  to test whether or not adding the knowledge flow to the conceptual design work flow could attenuate the cost and time overrunning. This paper elaborates on the process of validation testing by means of Simvision. Analysis of the results reveals that specifying the entity of the required knowledge during the conceptual design phase could reduce the cost and time overruns.

Abstract:
Abstract: The concept of Web 2.0 has gained widespread prominence in recent years. The use of Web 2.0 applications on an individual level is currently extensive, and such applications have begun to be implemented by organizations in hopes of boosting collaboration and driving innovation. Despite this growing trend, only a small number of theoretical perspectives are available in the literature that discuss how such applications could be utilized to assist in innovation. In this paper, we propose a theoretical model explicating this phenomenon. We argue that organizational Web 2.0 use fosters the emergence and enhancement of informal networks, weak ties, boundary spanners, organizational absorptive capacity, which are reflected in three dimensions of social capital, structural, relational, and cognitive. The generation of social capital enables organizational knowledge transfer, which in turn leads to organizational innovation. Based on this model, suggestions for organizations to facilitate this process are also provided, and theoretical implications are discussed.

Abstract:
Abstract: The rapid growth of knowledge economy in the last two decades has changed management styles. Organizations knowledge strategy should be driven from business strategy to ensure development of knowledge culture. Such a culture ensures knowledge activities, namely acquiring, sharing, creating, transforming and utilizing.  The knowledge environment will encourage and promote innovative processes.  The feedback from external environment and experience from previous projects will help in research and development.  The amalgamation of new and known knowledge will help devise ways and means of transformation for effective and efficient performance. A conceptual model is developed to study the moderating role of intellectual capital competencies in knowledge strategy&#8209;organizational performance relationship. The research studies how intellectual capital competencies moderate the knowledge strategy—organizational performance relationship. The novelty of this research is studying .relationship of Knowledge Strategy&#8209;Organizational performance trough moderating role of process innovation, research and development integration of past projects and market intelligence. This research will educate and create awareness in managers for nurturing organizations intellectual capital and managing their daily affairs effectively. It will guide in devising better strategies, processes and methods to manage intellectual capital. This will help create value through innovations and improved performance.

Abstract:
Abstract: The improvement of governments efficiency has gained great importance and validity especially in the current times of economic downturn. E&#8209;Government constitutes the most contemporary techno&#8209;managerial proposition in the track of possible interventions. The paper addresses, more specifically, empowerments necessitated by Public Administration (PA) organizations. Anchored on the needs of three real&#8209;life cases, the paper describes the conception and the realization of an IT artefact together with its methodological appeals aiming at improving information access and delivery and thus PAs decision making capacity. Our proposition constitutes a novel approach for managing users attention in knowledge intensive organizations which goes beyond informing a user about changes in relevant information towards proactively supporting the user to react on changes. The approach is based on an expressive attention model, which is realized by combining ECA (Event&#8209;Condition&#8209;Action) rules with ontologies. The technical realizations described in the paper constitute the underlying infrastructure of an Enterprise Attention Management System.

Abstract:
Abstract: Knowledge Management (KM) has come to be regarded as an important activity in todays organizations. Technology plays a crucial role in KM of facilitating knowledge flow through the knowledge life cycle.  This role is mostly realized by the implementation of a Knowledge Management System. However, the development of these systems is still haphazard, as organizations implement systems that are not guaranteed to enhance knowledge processing activities, and which may not be knowledge management systems at all. Most of these systems are groups of technologies brought together, with no theoretic and/or conceptual framework to justify the way in which they are integrated. The various forms of knowledge are not handled appropriately, as there is no distinction between the processes involved in managing these knowledge forms in the systems.  Hence knowledge distribution and use is not done consistently, efficiently, and effectively. There is therefore a need for a reference point from a technical perspective, emanating from a theoretic and conceptual framework that will guide in developing these systems. This reference point is best provided in the form of a generic knowledge management system architecture, which will guide all technological implementations for KM. This paper seeks to outline the need for a generic knowledge management system and what is to be taken into consideration in terms of technical as well as organizational objectives when developing it. The paper also presents some of the quality attributes to be considered in developing the architecture, and the technologies that can be incorporated.

Abstract:
Abstract:  The purpose of this paper is to test empirically the potential of Intellectual Capital (IC) as a driver of formation of cross border coalitions in European Union (EU) regions. The question is important given that, at present, economic and social cohesion is a major factor of stability in the EU.  We use a computational model based on different similarity matrices, for the cross&#8209;border cases of Portugal and Spain and for Hungary and Romania, respectively. We find that the results differ with the form of attraction we suppose between the regions, namely driven by diversity or conservative. At least the potential for attraction between such regions, based in IC, may be a useful approach for modeling. We believe that our model should be replicated in other EU regions, and thereby increased in depth. However, we regard our results as a promising step towards understanding some important organizing principles for the multi&#8209;regional economics of the 21st century.

Abstract:
Abstract: Intellectual capital has prevailed as a measure of core competency and competitive advantage which explains the gap between the market value and book value of a company. Given the fact that the nature of intellectual capital is abstract, intangible, and difficult to measure, a challenge has arisen for managers to evaluate intellectual capital performance effectively. Despite the fact that several methods have been proposed to assist managers in this area, there is still a scarcity of approaches that are able to combine accurate data from financial reports and subjective judgments by experts, and that are dedicated to measuring intellectual capital in the context of choosing a set of the most promising new products. This forms the motivation to propose a method for intellectual capital performance evaluation in the field of product development projects that is based on a fuzzy logic approach. Intellectual capital includes many intangible factors, and as a result, it is difficult to evaluate intellectual capital performance using only traditional crisp values. Therefore, an evaluation of intellectual capital is proposed according to linguistic variables used by experts. The proposed fuzzy logic approach applies fuzzy linguistic variables to express the level of qualitative evaluation of each intellectual capital dimension in the context of project management. The use of the proposed approach can support the decision&#8209;makers in the choice of a set of new products that are most promising, improving the planning and implementation of intellectual capital management, aiding companies in building their competitive advantages, and helping companies achieve sustainable development.

Abstract:
Abstract: Education of people is among the basic goals as well as outcomes of modern society. It is conditioned by the current demanding and turbulent environment requiring constant improvement, enhancement, adaptation and development of the level of education. It means that education needs to be permanent, reflecting all current needs resulting from the reality of changes. Education of employees can be characterised as a permanent process in which adaptation and changes of work behaviour, level of knowledge, skills and motivation of employees of an organisation by means of learning on the grounds of using various methods occurs. It results in reducing the difference between the current competence of employees and requirements posed on them. The objective of the article is to characterise the level of the focus of organisations operating in Slovakia on continuing education and development of employees. This article aims at presenting the results of research conducted in 2012 at the School of Economics and Management in Public Administration in Bratislava and at the Institute of Industrial Engineeering and Management, the Faculty of Materials Science and Technology in Trnava. The set of respondents comprised 340 randomly selected organisations operating in Slovakia. The key condition posed on them was the size of at least 50 employees. The analysis was used for information collected from literary sources or questionnaires. All the knowledge was dealt with in smaller parts in order to enable a more detailed focus. As to statistical methods, distribution characteristics were used to express the median. Most of the collected values were expressed in % upon the results summarisation. The methods of induction and deduction were used in the article upon deriving the conclusions. The method of comparison was used upon the evaluation of the present state, comparing organisations paying sufficient attention to human resources management and organisations not dealing with it at all. To evaluate the data, the SPSS 19 statistical programme and MS Excel 2007 were used. However, the research showed that only 9 % of respondents are heading towards the learning organisation successfully, i.e. 8 % of organisations apply the approach of targeted educational concept, and 1 % of organisations declared their approach to education to be the learning organisation concept. Unfortunately, more than 60 % of respondents are at the very beginning in the sphere of education, as they only restrict their educational activities to compulsory trainings enforced by legal regulations and to unscheduled courses.

Title:
An empirical Investigation of Maturity Levels in Knowledge Management

Abstract:
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to analyse if knowledge management maturity models can be applied in corporate practice. So far, empirical studies have mainly examined the influence of knowledge management (KM) on innovation and have identified KM success factors. The underlying assumption is that more KM leads to more innovation and an improved corporate success. Therefore, a thorough KM application is recommended. Little attention has been paid to the question which level of KM application is effective and efficient for a company. This paper tries to close this gap using the concept of KM maturity. It investigates if different KM maturity levels can be identified in corporate practice and in how far they are influenced by specific factors, e.g. company size. To answer the research questions, exploratory case studies were conducted through semi&#8209;structured qualitative interviews with representatives from ten northern German companies.The results show that the practical applicability of KM maturity models (KMMM) is still limited. None of the companies can be categorized to have a high KM maturity level despite their multiple use of KM tools. As influence factors the size of a company and an externally certified quality management were identified. To validate these findings an additional online survey was conducted with 79 participants. The results of this survey support the general statements above, but also show a significant relation with the KMM level and employees participation in knowledge management and the innovation success of a company compared to its main competitor. The paper contributes to the understanding of KM maturity and its influence factors and thus provides the foundation for further empirical research. Moreover, the findings help organisations to position their KM efforts.

Abstract:
Abstract: Trust has become an important intangible asset in organizations as a foundation for cooperation in workplace relationships. The paper discusses and examines development of trust in relation to communication within work relationships. More specifically, the dynamics of trust deterioration and trust breach is studied empirically. The paper examines the interplay between communication and trust and how building, violation, breaches and restoration of trust develop in inter&#8209;personal workplace relationships.  The aim of the paper is to provide new knowledge and insights of the dynamics between communication and trust and make practical implications to leadership and HRM for human capital development. By presenting the empirical findings from a qualitative case study with other complementing data the paper also aims to shed more light on how poor communication, in particular, affects trust development between actors involved. The paper advocates the importance of developing trust and communication for intangible intellectual asset in workplaces and their management. Originality of the paper is based on the idea of exploring the relation between trust and communication, specifically in the situation of trust violation and breach. The paper provides a still under researched issue of intangible assets, since relational resources such as trust and communication have not been widely examined in the context of trust breach, in specific. In the theoretical discussion, trust and communication are seen interwoven in interpersonal work relationships. Trust is looked as intangible asset and skill and communication a means and antecedent for trust. The findings show that poor communication plays an important role in deterioration and breaches of trust. Distrust may permeate widely within the organization and beyond the original parties involved. If space is left to the low trust climate to develop the consequences may be unfavorable, harmful and even damaging to the organization. Trust violation and breaches seem to be connected with workplace bullying wit

Abstract:
Abstract: The success of enterprise is bounded with achievement of the set targets and progress of enterprise in accordance with its mission. Performance of any enterprise is determined by the level of performance of individual employees. Starting from setting the objectives, from the strategic to the operational, procedures for their achievement, and the criteria for their evaluation, is the issue of performance management which is in consideration of industrial enterprise management in their day to day activities. Access to this issue affects the success of the enterprise on the market and its competitiveness. Objective indicators are supplemented by subjective evaluation of the representatives of the enterprise. Main challenge is to measure performance in the context of corporate culture, respectively to discover relations between corporate culture and the success of the enterprise. On the basis of the partial findings in this area, we have come to the conclusion about importance of relationship of corporate culture and the success of the enterprise and the suitability to continue its investigations in more details. In this article we present results of our previous researches.    Outcomes and conclusions, which we present in the paper, are based not only on theoretical knowledge, theories and results of published studies as well as several already completed results published under researches carried out by our institute but also on our researches focused on organizational performance.This contribution is a particular outcome of research project VEGA 1/0787/12 The identification of sustainable performance key parameters in industrial enterprises within multicultural environment and research project VEGA 1/0055/13 "Systematization of the impact of factors and conditions of knowledge management in the context of business strategy on work incentives and its reflection in growth efficiency, respectively sustainable level of business.

Abstract:
Scholars have approached to managing intangible elements from several perspectives throughout the literature. This field of research is still young, with no more than two decades of more intensive empirical research, which has confirmed the relevance of intangible&#8209;based elements on achieving a competitive edge in virtually every industry. Taxonomy and classifications of intangible elements have been built from either deductive or inductive methods. And also practitioners are more concerned and convinced that intangible elements are a key in the today⠒s competition, more than ever before. However, a categorization of approaches followed by scholars is still missed. The categorization proposed in this article will allow a more in&#8209;depth understanding of how intangible elements may help to achieve a competitive advantage, either from a theoretical or an empirical perspective. In addition, it will provide further information on how the different intertwined approaches relate to each other and, hence, it will help scholars and practitioners to gain a further understanding of how to implement intangible&#8209;based strategies more successfully. With these goals in mind, a search on the main databases was conducted (namely, ISI&#8209;Web of Knowledge and Scopus). Up to 4,308 different articles dealing somehow with intangible assets were found. In this paper, the title and keywords are analyzed and the content is categorized in six different themes: Knowledge Management refers to IA and its consequences in the Knowledge cycle; Intellectual Capital refers to IAs as mainly the knowledge&#8209;based economic value, divided into Human Capital, Relational Capital and Structural Capital; Human Resource Development refers to IAs as organizational learning; Economics deals with the micro and macroeconomic consequences of IAs and with the market of IAs; by Social Policy we mean IAs investment considered as a commodity which have social benefits and which are managed by social operators; and finally the Management and Accountability, where the quite old fashioned view is addressed a

Abstract:
Abstract: The recent economic crisis has caused a significant discontinuity in the world of business. Companies and researchers are constantly trying to understand the key drivers that caused significant impact on companies⠒ performance and how to challenge them in  the future. One still insufficiently covered research issue is the role that intellectual capital and its different components have played in the performance of small and medium&#8209;sized enterprises, and how this role has changed after the crisis. Intellectual capital has become a key value creation driver in the new economy. Its positive influence on firm performance has been proved by numerous empirical studies worldwide. Several of them also investigated how the economic crisis affected this paradigm. However, the body of knowledge supported by sound empirical findings in this field is still rather scarce. Therefore, the purpose of our study is to examine the relationship between intellectual capital (IC) and its different components, and firm performance before the recent economic crisis and in the period of recovery, among SMEs in different industries in Slovakia. To measure the level of IC and its respective components we applied the Value added intellectual coefficient (VAIC⌢) indicator developed by Pulic. This measure, however being criticized by some authors, is the most frequent metric used to evaluate IC and its components using financial data. We selected ROA as our performance measure... Our analysis also accounted for firm size and financial leverage while investigating the effect of IC on SME performance. We based our analysis on panel data comprising of 2008 and 2011 financial statements of 1947 Slovak SMEs operating in 10 industries (sections according to SK NACE rev. 2 classifications). These data were obtained from business information portal Universal Register Plus operated by CRIF &#8209; Slovak Credit Bureau. To compare the influence of IC on firm performance we constructed pre&#8209;crisis (2008) and post&#8209;crisis (2011) regression models and analyzed the observed differences

Abstract:
Abstract: Knowledge sharing research is growing in Latin America. Most instruments used to measure employees knowledge sharing activities have been developed in the Anglo&#8209;American language (English). Currently there is no instrument available to measure the knowledge&#8209;sharing construct in Spanish. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of the research process adopted to design, construct and validate such an instrument in the Spanish language. The validation process was conducted with 228 knowledge workers in Colombia. The instrument has two components. The first part (32 items) evaluates the different ways in which knowledge is shared in an organization. The second part (24 items) evaluates the different tools used in an organization to share knowledge. The validation process is structured in three steps: the construction of the items following a review of the literature; psychometric validation, and the statistical verification of the instruments sub&#8209;scales. Four categories of types of knowledge and four categories of knowledge sharing techniques are identified. The results of this research contribute to the understanding of a broader perspective of the measurement of knowledge sharing behavior and enable the measurement of this construct in Spanish. Many of the current instruments are very short and do not consider categories of knowledge sharing, neither tools people use to share knowledge. It is expected that the instrument will become a referent to the measurement of knowledge sharing in Spanish speaking countries. It is recommended the translation into English and the validation process of the instrument with an English speaking sample.

New Insights for Relational Capital

Abstract:
Abstract: In this paper, we concentrate on relational capital, manifestation of the old adage ⠀it is not what you know but who you know⠀. We propose that in this networked world, the importance of relationships between multiple stakeholders created by key personnel and financing becomes fundamental, and hence understanding and measuring those becomes fundamental, too. Accordingly, we highlight that there is a need to go beyond social, individual or personal relationships and organizational context, as well as beyond the limitations of the dyadic (one actor to one actor) view on relationships. Hence, we are introducing the ecosystem as the context for measuring relational capital. This paper builds on a construct of ecosystemic relational capital, created for understanding and measuring the importance of relationships in the context of ecosystems. It looks at the totality of relationships both at organizational level and at individual level, measuring the structures and characteristics related to individuals, organizations as well as the ecosystem as a whole (Still et al. 2014a). We acknowledge that the initial framework emphasizes the ⠜networking capabilities⠀ element of relational capital, with less attention to the element of ⠜customer loyalty and reputation⠀, which is the motivation for building on the construct. The processes of ecosystemic relational capital are already seen to be built on the possibilities afforded by the volumes of digital data, mostly from social media, providing details on the relationships between various actors related to various regions, sectors, technologies and products. However, we propose enhancing the holistic integration for better understanding and measuring of relational capital with the application of methods of social network analysis (SNA), network visualizations and social media analytics. In this paper, we present concrete examples of the enhanced framework. At the same time, we acknowledge that there are many other avenues for obtaining novel insights for relational capital with these analytics

The Communication of Intellectual Capital  Prevalence and relationship with Organizational Performance

Abstract:
Abstract: While intellectual capital (IC) as an asset is long noted, one area that has begun to attract attention is the communication of IC. The past decade of increasing global competition and economic downturns have enhanced the importance of the communication of IC, in particular, how IC supports organizational performance (OP).  Current literature on the communication of IC is limited to reporting metrics, which does not provide sufficient insights on OP. Yet, the need for the communication of IC is growing globally as investors are demanding for more non&#8209;financial information to reflect organizations sustainability.  Hence, the objectives of this study are three&#8209;fold. First is to ascertain the prevalence of the communication of IC, where past studies have reported low occurrence. Secondly, the study aims to examine the communication of IC in terms of content; and finally, to investigate the correlation of the communication of IC with OP. The dataset used in this study was drawn from annual reports and supplementary corporate disclosure (ARS) published for FYE2011 in English by 299 banks listed on the stock exchanges globally. The communication of IC was reviewed from three angles, human capital, relational capital and structural capital; and OP encompasses business continuity, risk management and organizational productivity. Content analysis was used to evaluate the communication of IC and to highlight nuances and trends. Findings showed that the communication of IC was prevalent in more than half of the banks in the dataset, where the communication of Human Capital content was most widely reported. Smaller banks, in particular, were found to be lacking in the communication of IC. Three peculiarities were also identified, namely inclusion of information on women, importance of training to organizational productivity, and extensiveness of risk management processes in banks.  The significance of this study lies in its effort to highlight relevance of the communication of IC from the perspective of IC components and its correlation to OP.

Abstract:
Abstract: The field of Knowledge Management (KM) is usually described in terms of generations. First generation KM viewed knowledge as an object and was focused on the use of IT, such as databases and portals. Second generation KM was orientated towards people and organisations. It emphasised tacit knowledge and communities of practice. Third generation KM recognised the importance of contextual contingencies and influences in aligning KM strategies with business strategies. Most recently, scholars have started to call for a new generation KM that will ensure the fields continued interest in academia and value in practice. The proponents of the new generation KM advocate the need for convergence between KM and other disciplines. Following the current trend, the purpose of this paper is to propose a new conceptual model that merges Knowledge Management (KM) with Project Management (PM).

Innovation Strategies as Outcomes of KM Practices and Antecedents of Firm Performance: Evidence from European Economies

Authors:
Inga Stankevice
Abstract:
Abstract: An organisationâ s ability to successfully operate in a competitive environment hinges to a large extent on innovation performance. In the paper, knowledge management (KM) practices, including methods stimulating new ideas and creativity, are viewed as antecedents of innovation strategies, and variance in organisational performance is presented as a consequence of implementation of different innovation strategies. Which KM practices contribute to the emergence of the most and least sophisticated innovation strategies? Which methods stimulating new ideas and creativity have the greatest potential in producing innovation? How is KM, via innovation strategies, related to firm performance? Where do the differences in innovation strategies and KM practices lie across countries? The paper is aimed at answering these questions and identifying KM practices typical of innovation strategies with varied levels of sophistication. Here, the sophistication depends on coherence (e.g. positive or negative, strong or weak) between the extent of an innovation strategy of an enterprise and the enterpriseâ s performance indicators. For the identification of innovation strategies, CIS8 database was used. It covers 60 innovation variables across 127,674 organizations from 12 core and 19 additional sectors and from 16 European economies. The innovation variables include different KM practices as well. Two firm performance indicators were also used in the research. For the identification of methods stimulating new ideas or creativity, CIS10 data were used. It covers six such methods; the sample includes enterprises from 24 European economies within innovation core sectors. The methods included exploratory factor analysis, correlation analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis and k&#8209;means cluster analysis. At each stage, the analyses were accompanied by rigorous validity and reliability tests. The originality of the paper lies in its attempt to interrelate different KM practices with not only innovation strategies and firm performance, but national economic&#8209;instit

Abstract:
Abstract: Against the background of global competition and increasingly dynamic markets, the importance of knowledge has been growing dramatically, especially for small and medium&#8209;sized enterprises (SME). SMEs have to be more innovative, flexible, and efficient to successfully cope with typical challenges such as growing competition and rapidly changing demand patterns. In the past, knowledge management has been successfully implemented and developed by large enterprises in particular. In contrast, knowledge management for SME is not a matter of course yet. However, current survey results affirm that activities in the area of knowledge management depend less on the size of an enterprise or its industry, but rather on an enterprise⠒s business strategy and core competencies. In the light of these results, SMEs seem not to have disadvantages regarding the implementation of knowledge management because of their size or industry, but rather because they need to take strategic decisions to implement such solutions and have difficulties in doing so. Against this background, the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology started the initiative ⠜Fit für den Wissenswettberb⠀ to support especially SMEs on the way to the knowledge society. In the course of the initiative, the research institutes Fraunhofer IPK and Fraunhofer IFF initiated the project ⠜ProWis ⠍ Prozessorientiertes und integriertes Wissensmanagement in KMU⠀. Within this project, researchers designed methods meeting the specific needs of SMEs allowing the implementation of process&#8209;oriented knowledge management at reasonable efforts. Building up on the developed methods, both institutes accompanied 15 SMEs during the implementation of knowledge management and used the findings from these implementations to refine the methods. The results of the project are summarized in the guideline ⠜Praxisleitfaden Wissensmanagement⠀, which is freely accessible to interested parties and enables SMEs to systematically and autonomously implement knowledge management.

As cities and regions transform from an industrial to a knowledge economy, there is a need to build new working relationships among academic, business communities, labor and workforce, civil society, and the technology sector  to create Knowledge Cities. A Knowledge City values all kinds of knowledge, is grounded in an economy that runs on knowledge and intellectual capital, and encourages knowledge markets and transactions. The 21st century knowledge economy is dependent upon knowledge cities and regions, representing a major shift from the industrial economy. Transforming an industrial city to a Knowledge City is not a trivial task.  It requires that all members of the society make the transition together.  Currently, there are no institutions that can facilitate this role. This paper considers how a Knowledge Sciences Center might fulfill that role, and reports on the thoughts of over 200 participants of the Knowledge Sciences Symposium held in Canton, Ohio, and Washington DC in 2013.  The paper also references recent initiatives to establish Knowledge Sciences Centers in the Eastern and Midwest regions of the United States.  The role of a transformational leader in establishing a Center is also highlighted.

Title:
Linking Unlearning with Innovation through Organizational Memory and Technology
Pages:

Authors:
Juan-Gabriel Cegarra-Navarro
Abstract:
While the information technologies provide organizational members with explicit concepts, such as writing instruction manuals, the 'organizational memory' provides individuals with tacit knowledge, such as systematic sets, routines and shared visions. This means that individuals within an organization learn by using both the organizational memory and the information technologies. They interact to reduce organizational information needs contributing to improve organizational innovativeness. However, the utilization of the organization memory or the technology infrastructure does not guarantee that appropriate information is used in appropriate circumstances or that information is appropriately updated. In other words, previous memories reflect a world that is only partially understood and assimilated, which might lead individuals to doing the wrong things right or the right things wrong. This paper examines the relative importance and significance of the existence of unlearning to the presence and nature of 'organizational memory and technology'. We further examine the effect of the existence of organizational memory and information technology on conditions that promote organizational innovativeness. These relationships are examined through an empirical investigation of 291 large Spanish companies. Our analysis found that if the organization considers the establishment of an unlearning culture as a prior step in the utilization of organization memory or the technology infrastructure through organizational innovativeness, then organization memory and technology have a positive influence on the conditions that stimulate organizational innovativeness.

Title:
Virtual Communities of Practice: Investigating Motivations and Constraints in the Processes of Knowledge Creation and Transfer
Pages:
pp11&#8209;20
Authors:
Ana Maria Ramalho Correia
Abstract:
With accelerated market volatility, faster response times and increased globalization, business environments are going through a major transformation and firms have intensified their search for strategies which can give them competitive advantage. This requires that companies continuously innovate, to think of new ideas that can be transformed into products, processes or services, generating value for the firm. Innovative solutions and processes are usually developed by a group of people, working together. A grouping of people that share and create new knowledge can be considered as a Community of Practice (CoP). CoPs are places which provide a sound basis for organizational learning and encourage knowledge creation and acquisition. Virtual Communities of Practice (VCoPs) can perform a central role in promoting communication and collaboration between members who are dispersed in both time and space. Nevertheless, it is known that not all CoPs and VCoPs share the same levels of performance or produce the same results. This means that there are factors that enable or constrain the process of knowledge creation. With this in mind, we developed a case study in order to identify both the motivations and the constraints that members of an organization experience when taking part in the knowledge creating processes of VCoPs. Results show that organizational culture and professional and personal development play important roles in these processes. No interviewee mentioned direct financial reward as a motivation factor for participation in VCoPs. Most identified the difficulty in aligning objectives, established by the management, with justification of the time spent in the VCoP. The interviewees also said that technology is not a constraint.

Organizing Customer Knowledge in Academic Libraries

Authors:

Abstract:
Availability of sophisticated ICT infrastructure combined with emerging business processes such as various service orientation configurations, constitute major characteristics of many of today's libraries in western universities. This has created a vast amount of customer&#8209;related information in libraries. This article provides a methodology for organising customer knowledge in academic libraries. A two&#8209;dimensional Customer Knowledge Taxonomy (CKT) has been presented for organizing the customer knowledge, thus providing a formal and explicit specification to deliver a shared conceptualization of customer knowledge. Based on the proposed CKT, customer knowledge in academic libraries can be classified into (i) knowledge about customers, (ii) knowledge from customers and (iii) knowledge for customers. The knowledge in each of these three categories can be 'explicit' and 'tacit', thus providing six categories of customer knowledge. The second major contribution of this paper is to introduce a method for integrating the above first and second categories of customer knowledge in order to derive the third category. This integration methodology is based on an integrated cyclical knowledge flow model that consists of four phases including: (i) communication, (ii) knowledge sharing & dissemination, (iii) knowledge acquisition and application, and 'iv' knowledge utilization and evaluation. Through a qualitative research, the proposed framework, consisting of the CKT and the corresponding integrated cyclical knowledge flow model, was then applied to a large university library for coding and classifying the vast amounts of existing customer data residing in 2,500 interview scripts within the case study organization. In doing so, a uniform coding scheme had to be developed using a focus group methodology. Data were then stored into a customer knowledge base using the Laximancer software. The proposed framework was evaluated for consistency of conceptualisation to ensure reusability in similar environments. It is expected that similar organisations will benefit from the proposed methodology for classifying the customer knowledge in academic libraries and the associated evaluation methodology for design and development of integrated knowledge based systems which in turn will support emerging processes within the organization.

Title:
The Adoption of Knowledge Management Systems in Small Firms
Pages:
pp33&#8209;42
Authors:
Pietro Evangelista
Abstract:
Knowledge Management (KM) is a critical area for small business managers in today's competitive environment. However, there is a general consensus in relation to the fact that the benefits of KM have not been fully exploited by small firms. In fact, des[ite the wide literature on KM, there is an abundance of research describing how large companies are successfully practising KM, but little contributions on the critical success factors for KM adoption in SMEs. Indeed, empirical studies have been rarely conducted on this topic. The main aim of this paper is to shed light on the KM practices in small firms. To this purpose, the paper presents the preliminary results of an empirical investigation carried out in a cluster of 25 high&#8209;technology SMEs located in the eastern area of Naples City (Italy). The methodology adopted is based on the following two main stages: a) a literature review on knowledge management and its usage in small business has been carried out; b) a semi&#8209; structured questionnaire has been set up and validated in a number of focus group discussions. The questionnaire survey has been conducted through interviews with managers of small firms belonging to the cluster investigated. Survey findings highlight the following points: â€” the surveyed companies show significant KM needs, but they adopt mainly internal KMSs that involve relatively simple ICT tools; â€” knowledge exchanged is mainly tacit and it requires KM tools based on personal relationships and interactions such as work teams; â€” ENS firms express the need for both internal and external KMSs enabling collaborative relationships with other firms for developing common projects; â€” there are some relevant factors motivating the adoption of internal and external KMSs in firms investigated (such as innovation, operational management and market features) but also significant barriers (such as the protection of intellectual capital and cultural barriers).

Wikifailure: the Limitations of Technology for Knowledge Sharing

Abstract:
Currently there is much interest in the use of Web 2.0 technologies to support knowledge sharing in organisations. Many successful projects have been reported. These reports emphasise how the use of such technology has unlocked new pathways for knowledge transfer. However, the limitations of Web 2.0 technologies are not yet well understood and potential difficulties may have been overlooked. This paper reports a case study of a Wiki which was implemented to support a group of researchers. Although belonging to the same institution, the group members were relatively dispersed and their research areas were disparate. Nevertheless a short study showed that there were benefits to be gained from sharing knowledge and that many of the researchers felt that a Wiki would be a good mechanism to support this. A Wiki was implemented and was initially very successful. A significant number of researchers contributed to the Wiki and almost all made use of it. However the usage declined over time and attempts to stimulate interest by providing incentives for contributions were unsuccessful. One year after launch use was minimal. A qualitative study was carried out to understand the reasons for this decline in use, and is reported in this paper. Responses suggest that two factors may have been particularly significant in explaining the failure of the system. One problem appears to have been a lack of critical mass. Only a small proportion of users are likely to contribute and there may be a threshold size for a community to be able to support a vibrant Wiki. Time also seems to have been an issue. Some respondents said that they simply were too busy to contribute to or use the system. Organisations which are considering the use of Web 2.0 technologies to support a knowledge management initiative should consider the likely impact of these factors in their own situation. Although technologies such as Wiki have great potential there are also pitfalls in undertaking such projects which are not yet well understood.

Limitations of Network Analysis for Studying Efficiency and Effectiveness of Knowledge Sharing

Abstract:
Knowledge sharing is an important part of an employee's tasks as it is one of the mechanisms through which they learn and innovate. Sharing of knowledge typically occurs in the informal networks in the organization by means of social interaction. Several authors have proposed to use social network analysis to study the knowledge sharing relations in organizations to identify potential barriers concerning knowledge sharing. Although social network analysis has been applied in several cases, it has not been evaluated if this approach results in reliable results in terms of findings problems related to knowledge sharing. One might for instance find an isolated person with network analysis, but given the context this might not be necessary a problem. The goal of this research is to validate the use of social network analysis to study knowledge networks. We have selected one particular technique, called Knowledge Network Analysis, to evaluate in this research. The Knowledge Network Analysis technique has been applied in a case study at an international product software developer to find potential barriers in their knowledge networks. To evaluate these results, a qualitative analysis has been executed afterwards by a different researcher. This analysis was based on interviews, document study and observations. To analyze the qualitative data we developed a new model called Knowledge Sharing Environment Model (KSEM), which identifies knowledge sharing bottlenecks in a structured manner. The results from network analysis and the qualitative analysis have been compared to validate the outcomes of the network analysis. Hence, six out of nine bottlenecks were validated. This research demonstrates that Knowledge Network Analysis is a good tool for the identification of bottlenecks but needs further validation in additional case studies. However, it was suggested to combine the Knowledge Network Analysis technique with another method such as the KSEM to validate and study the causes behind the identified bottlenecks.

Title:
Exploring Knowledge Work Practices and Evolution in Distributed Networks of Practice
Pages:
pp69&#8209;78
Authors:
Eli Hustad
Abstract:
This paper derives from a longitudinal study conducted in a multinational company. Through an interpretive case study approach, we have explored the phenomenon of knowledge networking in distributed work. More specifically, we have focused on the evolution patterns in a particular knowledge networking structure denoted as distributed networks of practice. The paper conceptualizes this kind of network of practice as an information and communication technology (ICT) facilitated dynamic relationship of participants that are geographically and temporally dispersed from one another, and who are sharing and creating knowledge related to their daily work practices and business problems. Three different categories of networks were identified 1) problem solving networks, 2) business improvement networks, and 3) innovation networks. Findings demonstrate that the networks evolved differently over time, and the study identified four distinct evolution patterns comprising 1) devolution in terms of short life cycle and dissolution, 2) recursive patterns where new ad&#8209;hoc networks emerged from the mother network, 3) integration of knowledge practices through cross&#8209;network proposals, and 4) innovation and expansion in scope and size. While previous studies have suggested fixed models for how a life cycle of a community takes place, this study however identified four dissimilar evolution patterns. Thus, these findings challenge life cycles models suggested in traditional community of practice research. The paper utilizes an information infrastructure perspective to provide an improved understanding of the evolution patterns within these networks by viewing them as ecological social structures facilitated by a technological infrastructure.  Through social lines of practice and effective knowledge sharing, the participants created an infrastructure of knowing within the organization and managed to alter organizational practices through evolution. The paper illustrates how a knowledge networking structure as such may facilitate distributed work practices and knowledge activities across temporal and spatial boundaries.

Abstract:
It is widely accepted that knowledge management is a critical success factor for enterprises. Not yet known sufficiently are the factors, which influence the success of knowledge management in order to measure the effectiveness of knowledge management. This paper sets out a quantitative study to investigate these factors. Firstly, an overview of empirical work undertaken and the potential success factors is given. After this, the methodology of the study is described. Thereby the basics of structure equation modelling (SEM) are shown. The difference between structure and measurement model is depicted and different validity measures are described. Also two common and possible methods to evaluate a SEM, the co&#8209;variance analysis and the variance analysis are displayed. Thirdly a specific model is presented to use SEM in the context of knowledge management success. The model is based on the theory of planned behaviour and is adapted to the context of knowledge management success. Thereby knowledge management success is seen on an individual level, which means that successful knowledge management leads to a satisfying knowledge supply of the organisation member. Finally limitations of the work are discussed.

Title:
A Framework for Assessing Commensurability of Semantic Web Ontologies
Pages:
pp91&#8209;102
Authors:
Liam Magee
Abstract:
The Semantic Web proposes a framework for establishing a "web of data", analogous to the "web of documents" of the World Wide Web. It envisions a series of interconnected ontologies, underwritten by formal languages such as OWL and RDF. The problem of co&#8209;ordinating disparate ontologies has led to the development of various ontology matching approaches. However, as these approaches are algorithmic they cannot make use of background or tacit information about the ontologies they examine â€” information only available in the broader social context in which ontologies are created and used. In many practical knowledge management scenarios, such information is vital in understanding the costs, feasibility and scope of ontology alignment projects. Prior to undertaking the detailed task of concept&#8209;to&#8209;concept mapping between two ontologies, it is therefore useful to ask: are these ontologies broadly commensurable? This paper presents a framework for describing and comparing cultural information about ontologies, developed as part of a joint project conducted by RMIT University and FujiXerox Australia, "Towards the 'Semantic Web': Standards and Interoperability across Document Management and Publishing Supply Chains". The framework is intended for practitioners to use as a tool to arrive at better estimates and assessments of the scope of work required to develop an adequate translation between two or more ontologies. The framework has been piloted as an online software toolkit, which is presented to a small group of participants. After using the software, participants complete an evaluation, which elicits quantitative and qualitative feedback on both the framework and the software. The paper presents the results of the pilot testing process, along with some considerations of how the framework might be further improved.

Assessing the Impact of KM on Organisational Practice: Applying the MeCTIP Model to UK Organisations
Pages:
pp103&#8209;118
Authors:
Sandra Moffett
Anne Hinds
Abstract:
With the emergence of the knowledge intensive industry, where organisations rely on the knowledge of their staff for competitive advantage (Lustri et al., 2007), KM has become key for business success (Mu&#8209;jung et al., 2007). KM, once seen as a fad (Ramsey, 1996) is now an integral business function (Zhou and Fink, 2003) in both traditional and internet&#8209;based businesses (Borges Tiago et al., 2007) to the extent that KM is now viewed essential for profit (Yang, 2008). Despite the great progress made in KM over the past decade (Omega Editorial, 2009) much confusion exists around the practical implementation of knowledge&#8209;orientated programmes, resulting in either an overemphasis on technology to the exclusion of adequate peoplequality planning, or, strong peoplequality programmes from a knowledge perspective, hindered by inadequate enabling technologies. For example, organisations question how current KM models, frameworks and programmes can be applied across all organisations uniformly? If changes are necessary to the approach adopted by an organisation, what are these changes and are the drivers behind the change approaches largely implementation modifications or are there more fundamental issues to be resolved? Are the most important issues (King, 2007) being addressed? How is KM success defined? (Jennex and Croasdell, 2007) Considering the large investment capital expended by many firms in KM systems (Curley, 1998) and the growing number of companies that see KM as potentially helping them survive and compete, there is a need for more definitive and comprehensive studies in this field for systematic empirical research and in&#8209;depth rich case studies. This paper presents results of empirical research undertaken in early 2009 with 588 UK companies. Research purpose is to assess the impact of the MeCTIP model [Moffett, 2000; Moffett et al., 2002, 2003] on UK companies to identify key factors for successful implementation, practice and development of KM. The research employs the 'Benchmarking KM' online survey tool. This paper focuses on research methodology and initial survey results using statistical analysis techniques such as descriptives and factor analysis. Avenues for further research are identified.

Functional Concept for a Web&#8209;Based Knowledge Impact and IC Reporting Portal

Authors:

Abstract:
Knowledge and Intellectual Capital (IC) are key resources and crucial fields of investment in today's business organisations and the economy. Problems in strategically and effectively using those resources mainly consist in: (i) how to specify, summarize, visualize the current state of knowledge and IC; (ii) how to comfortably provide access to scattered and ill&#8209;structured information on the current state of knowledge and IC; (iii) how to define, understand, visualize the impact of knowledge on organizational performance and of IC on the economy; (iv) how to assess and evaluate strategies and activities for purposefully intervening in organizations and economies by means of knowledge and IC. To overcome this, the paper presents methods, functionality and tools forming a web&#8209;based infrastructure which provides user&#8209;friendly access to information and understanding of knowledge impacts and IC market at company, sector, national and global levels. This infrastructure basically consists of two sections. The first section enables us to immediately benchmark a company's knowledge management maturity according to specific input data and information, provide tailored feedback and suggest changes in the company's strategy concerning knowledge&#8209;related activities. With this, companies should be motivated to provide their data and support continuous testing, evaluation and improvement of all methods, models, measures and benchmarks following an experimental design. The second section consists of a "World Atlas on Intellectual Capital" comprising world&#8209;wide data on the following constituents of the IC market: demand, supply, equilibrium, investment, need, stock, flow, and returns. With this, the web&#8209;based knowledge impact and IC reporting portal will support decision makers at company and political levels to purposefully intervene on the attitude towards knowledge and IC through guidelines. Consequently, the paper contributes to research and development to measure and with this to develop a better understanding of the impact of knowledge (management) and IC on the delivery of effective business processes and high value services.

Evaluating a Living Model of Knowledge

Abstract:
The definition of knowledge has always been a contentious issue in knowledge management. Effective knowledge management requires a definition of knowledge that is consistent, useful and true. Whilst most definitions today fulfil the first two criteria, none accurately address all three, including the true, biological nature of knowledge. This is where autopoiesis can help. Autopoiesis was developed to try to answer the question of what makes something living, using a scientific methodology. It proposes living things are discrete, self&#8209;producing entities and constantly cognising entities. Autopoiesis has long inspired definitions of knowledge, with ideas such as: knowledge cannot be transferred, or knowledge can only be created by the potential 'knower'. Using the theory of autopoiesis, it is possible to create a biologically grounded model of knowledge, representing the latest thinking in neuroscience. However, before this new, biologically grounded model of knowledge can be integrated into new or existing knowledge management theories, it needs to be tested, else it falls into the trap of being conceptual, and remaining that way. This paper starts with the autopoietic, and therefore biologically, grounded model of knowledge, and develops the new evaluation framework necessary to test the model. The evaluation methodology developed in this research started from the field of programme evaluation and was adapted to meet the needs of the knowledge management discipline. This paper subsequently presents the initial findings from the evaluation process and takes the first steps to identifying how knowledge management can improve with its newly found scientific grounding.

People, Technology, Processes and Risk Knowledge Sharing

Authors:

Abstract:
The present global economic crisis creates doubts about the good use of accumulated experience and knowledge in managing risk in financial services. Typically, risk management practice does not use knowledge management (KM) to improve and to develop new answers to the threats. A key reason is that it is not clear how to break down the "organizational silos" view of risk management (RM) that is commonly taken. As a result, there has been relatively little work on finding the relationships between RM and KM. We have been doing research for the last couple of years on the identification of relationships between these two disciplines. At ECKM 2007 we presented a general review of the literature(s) and some hypotheses for starting research on KM and its relationship to the perceived value of enterprise risk management. This article presents findings based on our preliminary analyses, concentrating on those factors affecting the perceived quality of risk knowledge sharing. These come from a questionnaire survey of RM employees in organisations in the financial services sector, which yielded 121 responses. We have included five explanatory variables for the perceived quality of risk knowledge sharing. These comprised two variables relating to people (organizational capacity for work coordination and perceived quality of communication among groups), one relating to process (perceived quality of risk control) and two related to technology (web channel functionality and RM information system functionality).  Our findings so far are that four of these five variables have a significant positive association with the perceived quality of risk knowledge sharing: contrary to expectations, web channel functionality did not have a significant association. Indeed, in some of our exploratory regression studies its coefficient (although not significant) was negative. In stepwise regression, the variable organizational capacity for work coordination accounted for by far the largest part of the variation in the dependent variable perceived quality of risk knowledge sharing. The "people" variables thus appear to have the greatest influence on the perceived quality of risk knowledge sharing, even in a sector that relies heavily on technology and on quantitative approaches to decision making. We have also found similar results with the dependent variable perceived value of Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) implementation.

Knowledge&#8209;Based Strategies for Knowledge Intensive Business Services: a Multiple Case&#8209;study of Computer Service Companies

pp151&#8209;160
Authors:
Enrico Scarso
Ettore Bolisani
Abstract:
While knowledge is increasingly considered to be a key resource for companies, the models for formulating business strategies that explicitly include it as a core component are still lacking. The paper investigates such issues by considering the particular case of computer service companies, which can be seen as Knowledge Intensive Business Services (KIBS) firms connecting the sources of innovation (i.e. large multinationals, research laboratories, universities, etc.) to the individual needs of the local customers. In doing so they operate as mediators between the local cognitive requirements and the more generic knowledge available in the global environment. Since those companies base their competitiveness on the capability to manage knowledge flows among various actors, the formulation of their business strategies requires new approaches that directly focus on knowledge assets and relevant processes. The paper describes the results of a survey involving twenty&#8209;one computer service companies located in the Northeast of Italy. The study allows the user to draw useful schemes for the identification of knowledge&#8209;based strategies, which can be of use beyond the specific context of investigation. In particular, rather than proposing completely new models for knowledge&#8209;based strategic formulations, the paper analyses the way knowledge can be integrated into more traditional strategic frameworks. The assumption is that these approaches can be more comfortable and understandable by the management of companies whose business is strongly based on knowledge but don't have deliberate knowledge management strategies.

Measuring the Effects of Knowledge Management Practices

Abstract:
Successful managers focus their attention on factors that are critical in establishing and maintaining an organisation's competitive edge. The knowledge and skill of employees is one of those factors and it requires proactive management attention. Conceptually, this is achieved through Knowledge Management, a term that has existed in the mainstream of business lexicon for quite some time. Despite this, there is the conspicuous absence of a common understanding of the term that frustrates many managers. Studies have clearly established that there are three interdependent and complementary pillars that support the concept of Knowledge Management. These are Organisational Learning Management (OLM), Organisational Knowledge Management (OKM) and Intellectual Capital Management (ICM). OLM, which has so far dominated both academic and practitioner debate, concerns itself with the problem of capturing, organising and retrieving explicit knowledge, or information, and has led to the simplistic misconception that Knowledge Management only involves the capture, or downloading, of the content of employees' minds. ICM is dominated by those particularly interested in defining key performance indicators that will measure the impact and the benefits of applying knowledge management practices. If management requires measurement this is an essential task but it can only be undertaken once an organisation has clearly established the strategy&#8209;structure&#8209;process parameters to ensure it accesses, creates and embeds the knowledge that it needs...the OKM pillar of knowledge management. This paper looks more deeply at this pillar and in particular the lack of a general integrative approach to enhancing organisational performance in this key strategic area. It considers to what extent such an approach may help an organisation more effectively manage its most relevant source of competitive advantage. With a greater awareness of the various factors allied to the managing and leveraging of human oriented and system oriented knowledge assets, some proposals are put forward to assist in developing or redefining an organisation's intellectual capital reporting models in search of a planning, control and performance measurement system that accounts for the management of an organisation's intellectual assets.

Abstract:
During the last decade, the Thai government has recognized that Thailand needs to move toward an economy not only based on the cheapness of labour but also based on its intellectual capital and innovation capability. Therefore, the country has set up initiatives and specific policy to attract multinational corporations that could contribute to raise the research and development capacity of the country. Several studies have been undertaken to evaluate the role that Multinational corporations could play in knowledge creation, technology diffusion and development of potential R&D within South East Asia. Amongst the several approaches investigating the factors fostering Innovation in developing countries, one strategy would be to strength the Universities&#8209;Industries (UI) relationship. The success and failure of the University&#8209;Industry linkage has been widely discussed, but there is still a need to understand the dimensions impacting on the willingness of multinational corporations to share knowledge with Thai Universities. This paper discusses the balance of factors (industrial characteristics, firm characteristics and business models) that can play a substantial role in enhancing the knowledge sharing mechanisms.

Title:
Intellectual Capital Development
Pages:
pp181&#8209;192
Authors:
Eckhard Ammann
Abstract:
An approach for intellectual capital development in an organisation is given. It is based on a new conception of knowledge and knowledge dynamics and raises the notion of knowledge conversions to the level of intellectual capital domains. Intellectual capital development can be modelled with this approach by means of general transformations between domains and between appropriate parts of these domains, which themselves are refined and modelled with general knowledge conversions. To attain this approach, a new conception of knowledge and knowledge dynamics is introduced. The knowledge conception is represented by a knowledge cube, a three&#8209;dimensional model of knowledge with types, kinds and qualities. The type dimension addresses the internal&#8209;external aspect of knowledge, seen from the perspective of the human being. The kind dimension distinguishes various knowledge kinds like propositional or procedural knowledge. Finally, in the quality dimension, several quality measures of knowledge are given. Built on this conception, knowledge dynamics is modelled with the help of general knowledge conversions between knowledge assets. A set of basic knowledge conversions is given in a way, such that more complex general conversions may be easily gained by building on this set. Through this conception, we gain a sound basis for knowledge management and development in an enterprise. Raising this knowledge development approach to the more strategic and resource&#8209;oriented intellectual capital level in an organisation, general transformations between the three main intellectual capital domains (individual competence, internal and external structure) and between parts of them can be described. With their help a model for intellectual capital development is gained: In a top&#8209;down approach, general transformations of intellectual capital are broken down to the notion of general knowledge conversions. This leads to development of the intellectual capital, i.e. to value creation in a company. To indicate the applicability of our approach, an example for the development of customer relations capital is given.

Abstract:
It is widely recognized that knowledge&#8209;based resources and assets are fundamental to performance improvement and organizational value creation. Limited progress has been made, however, in valuing and managing organizational knowledge in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) operating in the renewable energy sector. This paper provides first insights of an ongoing research project managed by the Intellectual Assets Centre in Scotland, in order to support the adoption of knowledge asset management initiatives for driving the improvement of value creation mechanisms of SMEs operating in the renewable energy sector. We employ research related to resource&#8209;based and knowledge&#8209;based theory and performance measurement and management, to gain a better understanding of how Scottish SMEs operating in the renewable energy industry acquire and manage knowledge assets in their bid to improve performance and value creation. Using a sample of organizations from the Scottish renewable energy sector we draw first insights about their perception and orientation to identifying, measuring and managing knowledge, and to qualitatively identify a feasible set of knowledge resources and assets potentially driving performance improvement. The first evidence indicates an awareness of the relevance of the knowledge&#8209;based factors, and engagement in knowledge acquisition and creation processes. These firms possess a good endowment of knowledge assets, with significant internal knowledge management processes, but also external inflows from agents such as firms and education or research institutions. However, the visible lag in the exploitation of knowledge assets and processes, together with observed under&#8209;financing of the sector and difficulty in accessing skilled labor, indicates the need for efforts to better address specific needs of renewable energy sector SMEs.

Why Intellectual Capital Management Accreditation is a Tool for Organizational Development?

Abstract:
In March 2000, the European Council held an extraordinary meeting to agree a new strategic goal for the European Union in order to strengthen a knowledge&#8209;based economy. The Council has a strategy &#8209; the Lisbon Strategy &#8209; aiming in the next 10 years to make the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge&#8209;based economy in the world. Intellectual capital has become a key element of the knowledge economy. Its management is therefore a factor influencing the competitive advantage of companies, regions and even countries. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the importance of intellectual capital management accreditation as a factor in the organizational development of companies, especially small and medium&#8209;sized enterprises (SMEs). The methodology ICMA &#8209; Intellectual Capital Management Accreditation (Matos and Lopes, 2009) will be discussed here, as well as the effect of this methodology on SMEs' innovation processes. It is considered that intellectual capital management accreditation may be a relevant process in the consolidation of an innovative dynamic, which will contribute to the continuous creation of competitive advantages. There are various intellectual capital valuation methodologies, but the research about the effect of the certification and accreditation is still very limited so it is necessary to get more results. However, the methodological research that supported the ICMA system points to the fact of accreditation procedures favouring better management of intellectual capital, thus contributing significantly to improving the organizational performance of accredited companies. This paper also aims to contribute to the international recognition of the importance of the audit of intellectual capital.

What National Intellectual Capital Indices Can Tell About the Global Economic Crisis of 2007&#8209;2009?
Pages:
pp253&#8209;266
Authors:

Abstract:
In the past few years, the concept of intellectual capital has been expanded from organizational level to national and regional level. A model of 29 national intellectual capital indices (NICI40) has been constructed and validated by utilizing data of the IMD Competitiveness Yearbook. Research on the 14 years data, spanning from 1995 to 2008, indicates the pattern and progression of national intellectual capital in 40 countries. Trend analyses of this set of panel data disclose very interesting phenomena, such as Iceland shows the most rapid progress in national intellectual capital and is a rising star in economic development with an outstanding 94% GDP per capita (ppp) growth over 14 years. Moreover, it was number one of the OECD countries according to The Global Benchmark Report 2006 and received a consistently high ranking in world standard&#8209;of&#8209;living surveys. Unfortunately, the recent financial crisis almost crippled its national financial system and wrote off its past economic performance. On the contrary, Norway lags behind its Nordic peers in national intellectual capital development; yet its resilience to the 2007&#8209;2009 financial crisis impact is noticeable. Furthermore, Norway generously offers financial support for IMF to assist some ailing neighboring countries. Why the intellectual capital rising star crumbled down and the seemingly static country sustained the crisis? What is the implication of this controversy? The research results of this study have some implications for relevant policy makers.

A Framework for Knowledge Integration and Social Capital in Collaborative Projects
Pages:

Authors:
Mamata Bhandar
Abstract:
Collaborative projects are increasingly common today and such projects require specialized knowledge of the partners to be integrated, therefore posing the challenge of inter&#8209;organizational knowledge integration; integrating diverse knowledge bases across organizations. Studies on knowledge integration and inter&#8209;organizational networks indicate the positive influence of social capital in the context. Since partners in a collaborative project are likely to possess this resource due to their partnership, a knowledge integration view is adopted to conduct an empirical investigation of a three&#8209;partner collaborative project to investigate the influence of social capital. The study shows how the different aspects of social capital influence the knowledge integration behaviour of the partners for the project. Implications to research and practice are discussed.

Knowledge Management in Evidence&#8209;Based Medical Practice: Does the Patient Matter?
Pages:
pp281&#8209;292
Authors:
William Boateng
Abstract:
Evidence&#8209;based medicine has greatly influenced decisions and actions throughout the health care industry for a couple of decades, particularly in the advanced countries. However, little is known as to how patients with their tacit knowledge have fitted into the evidence&#8209;based medical practice equation especially in the developing world, hence the need for this study. The combined use of the theory of communicative action and the AGIL taxonomy of adaptation, goal attainment, integration, and latent pattern maintenance by Talcott Parsons served as the theoretical framework for the study. The theory of communicative action provided the benchmark in understanding how doctors and patients are motivated to adapt and integrate the explicit and tacit knowledge forms in attaining the goal of quality evidence&#8209;based medical practice in line with the AGIL taxonomy. The qualitative interviews with fifty respondents &#8209; twenty doctors and thirty patients &#8209; in the central region of Ghana are utilized as the data base for the discussion. The study concludes that at present patients’ tacit knowledge does not matter in the practice of evidence&#8209;based medicine in Ghana. This situation has to be addressed by empowering patients to be actively involved in clinical decision&#8209;making affecting their health. This is critical because effective implementation of evidence&#8209;based medical practice demands a good blend of explicit and tacit knowledge forms possessed by doctors and patients respectively. It is believed that embracing this strategy of managing knowledge in the health care dispensation holds the potential to bring about improved health care outcomes.

Methods and Tools for Knowledge Management in Research Centres
Pages:
pp293&#8209;306
Authors:
Jean-Louis Ermine
Abstract:
In the Knowledge Based Economy, research centres whether industrial or public, play a fundamental role. In terms of Knowledge Management, these organisations have a special status, because their production is knowledge and only knowledge. The Knowledge Capital they accumulate in their activities therefore is a strong strategic issue and the management of these assets has become crucial. The problem addressed in this paper is to design a pertinent methodology for Knowledge Management considering the specificity of knowledge production by research centres. This methodology is based on a suitable model to describe that knowledge production. The reference model is built on knowledge flows between the organisation and its knowledge workers, and a subsystem called “Knowledge Capital”. A research centre is defined by the fact that its product is only knowledge and is accumulated in its knowledge subsystem. Some economical characteristics of this Knowledge Capital are shown as being very adapted to knowledge produced in research centres. The methodology is based on two tools. The first tool is the knowledge map that can represent a comprehensive model of the Knowledge Capital of the organisation, which is often not well known or unstructured. That map is built on a shared and consensual vision of the main knowledge actors. It is not a map produced by a knowledge tool, but a co&#8209;construction (through interviews) with the knowledge actors. The second tool is a grid for criticality analysis (Critical Knowledge Factors), which evaluates the knowledge domains of the organisation and suggests appropriate actions to be put in place for the most critical domains. This tool is a guide for interviewing knowledgeable actors in the organisation, to collect and analyse a set of data for decision support. The aim of the methodology is to provide a set of recommendations to build a KM plan of actions to preserve, share and make evolve the Knowledge Capital. The methodology has been elaborated through constant feed&#8209;back with practice, and has been validated in many real cases in various countries. Three case studies (France, Brazil, and Canada) are succinctly described to exemplify the effectiveness of the methodology.

Is Tacit Knowledge Really Tacit?

Authors:
Anu Puusa
Mari Eerikäinen
Abstract:
The aim of this article is to increase understanding of tacit knowledge as a phenomenon and also, to specify and understand tacit knowledge of an expert in a given context. In the discourse of organizational behavior, the use of the concept of tacit knowledge and empirical scientific research on it has become more popular only in the 1990s. The strong increase in expert work and knowledge&#8209;intensive fields make examining the topic timely and both theoretically and practically interesting. The most significant theoretical contribution of the study is the increase in understanding, as well as, the creation of new knowledge of the contents and the nature of tacit knowledge. Based on our study, it seems that the current division of knowledge to explicit and tacit is not sufficient to describe the phenomenon. It has been proposed that explicit knowledge is visible and “articulated” knowledge that can easily be transferred and codified, e.g., through speech, documents and various information management systems. Implicit knowledge, on the other hand, is “silent”, hidden and non&#8209;verbal knowledge that is difficult or even impossible to transfer and express verbally. We propose that tacit knowledge comprises different components, some of which can be articulated and made explicit. Examples of such are individual’s or organizations accustomed lines of action that are based on explicit instructions. On the other hand, individual&#8209;specific tacit knowledge that includes feelings, emotions and intuition, individual’s intuitive behaviour or personal relationships, can be considered as “the genuine tacit knowledge” in the sense that it cannot be made visible or transferred. These findings suggest that the interconnectedness of explicit and tacit knowledge ought to be examined further.

The Inertia Problem: Implementation of a Holistic Design Support System

Abstract:
This paper describes and reflects on the implementation of a Knowledge Based Holistic Design Support System – termed “HolD” – into a business environment. The paper introduces the rationale and development behind the system, a consciously different approach to traditional knowledge based systems in engineering in order to meet the requirements of a small business, producing bespoke low volume products. Typical knowledge based engineering systems rely on explicitly codified knowledge which often supports product optimisation rather than creative design activities. Such a system would provide little benefit to a business producing bespoke products. Instead, the system presented here, supports the creativity of designers through codified tacit knowledge input by designers as meta&#8209;data for past designs. The problem of individual inertia in adopting the system and sharing knowledge was approached early in the construction of the system. The steps taken to lower user barriers and encourage day&#8209;to&#8209;day use are detailed, including the design of a multi&#8209;stage input process designed to interact at key stages of users' existing processes. The immediate results after a six month trial period are presented and the results show slower than anticipated usage. In particular designers were found to be reluctant to input detailed information beyond common identifying data and did not attempt to seek information from the system. The reasons for this slower usage are discussed and possible solutions presented. The paper therefore provides industrial based evidence of the inertia encountered when implementing a knowledge system and argues that technology alone is insufficient to overcome this inertia.

The Knowledge&#8209;Based Foundations of Organisational Performance Improvements: An Action Research Approach
Pages:
pp333&#8209;344
Authors:
Giovanni Schiuma
Daniela Carlucci
Abstract:
The strategic and management literature grounded on the resource and knowledge based view of the firm, has widely outlined the importance of knowledge assets in a company’s value creation. However, despite acknowledgment of the strategic relevance of knowledge assets and their management for driving organizational performance improvement, there is still a lack of suitable approaches to disentangle, explain and assess how knowledge assets support the achievement of a company’s strategic outcomes. The paper investigates the role and relevance of knowledge assets in a company’s performance improvement and provides some approaches, tools and managerial suggestions regarding the leveraging knowledge assets as value drivers for improving organisational performance. Methodology: The study is based on action research methodology. Findings: This paper highlights the role and relevance of knowledge assets as critical factors to manage for improving a company’s performance. In particular, integrating the results of an action research project with the main insights from a literature review, the paper provides some approaches, tools and managerial suggestions mainly regarding: i) the identification and mapping of knowledge assets to be managed in order to improve performances; ii) the choice and the design of knowledge assets management initiatives; iii) the evaluation of the performance improvement gained by the implementation of knowledge assets management initiatives. Research limitations: The paper investigates the leveraging knowledge assets for a company’s performance improvement in a specific context of analysis, i.e. the New Product Development (NPD) process. In order to have a more holistic view of the interactions between knowledge assets and company’s value creation mechanisms, an extension of the investigation to other organisational processes is required. Moreover, to generalise the research’s results, several applications in different industries and the use of different research methodologies are required. Practical implications: The paper, on the basis of theoretical and empirical insights, provides four managerial practices which managers might use in order to design and implement knowledge assets management initiatives aimed to support the improvement of company’s performances. Originality/value: The paper provides more light on how knowledge assets and complementarities among them enhance organization’s performances and provides approaches, tools and managerial suggestions for supporting managers in developing and leveraging knowledge assets. Especially the proposed approaches and tools intended to provide managers with information to assist them to allocate their managerial efforts to the knowledge assets with significant impact on performance.

Exploring Web 2.0 Applications as a Mean of Bolstering up Knowledge Management

Abstract:
Abstract: Web 2.0 applications aim at improving the interaction between users. Web 2.0 principles overlap with characteristics of knowledge management (KM) or could be applied to reshape KM practices. Applying Web 2.0 applications to KM has the potential to improve the sharing and creation of knowledge. However, little research has been conducted in this area. This research aims at identifying Web 2.0 applications for bolstering up organizations’ KM practices. An additional aspect addressed is how Web 2.0 applications for KM can be categorized and how they match different aspects of the KM strategy of an organization. The research examines the suitability of Web 2.0 applications in KM by conducting exploratory case studies in two student&#8209;run organizations, which are an interesting research subject because their members are considered most open towards new technologies. The case studies aim at exploring which Web 2.0 applications are in place. Based on the findings we propose a framework for categorizing Web 2.0 applications for KM. The findings indicate that Web 2.0 applications may enhance KM and may even initiate a new era of KM. Moreover, the article provides a discussion of a number of Web 2.0 applications and proposes a way of categorizing these applications. The proposed framework allows assessing the use of Web 2.0 applications for KM and can be used as an orientation for the introduction of Web 2.0 applications in organizational KM. The research contributes to the general understanding of how Web 2.0 applications can be used in KM. The proposed framework for categorizing Web 2.0 applications provides an orientation for organizations that want to use these applications for bolstering up their KM practices.

Inter&#8209;generational learning dynamics in universities

Abstract:
Inter generational learning is an open process people of all ages can learn from each other in a stimulating context. It is a complex process of knowledge sharing that overcomes age and cultural barriers. Inter&#8209;generational learning is more specific for those organizations where people group together in age layers or strata. Universities are such kind of layered or nested organizations. The purpose of this paper is to present some results of our research in the field of inter&#8209;generational learning and knowledge sharing in universities. This topic is important because a university is by its own nature a nested knowledge organization, due to a continuous flow of students and the bottom&#8209;up regeneration of the faculty staff. Knowledge creation and knowledge loss are intertwined processes, and both of them are strongly influenced by the age scale. A university is a multilayered knowledge organization, where the inner most layers are represented by older professors who concentrate the fundamental structures of knowledge, and the outer layers are represented by students in their different learning cycles. In this paper we are interested in assessing the choices done by the academic staff, in the context of the determinant criterions and trade&#8209;offs in inter&#8209;generational learning. This had been done in the framework of Analytic Hierarchic Processes (AHP). We thought that this is a proper tool since it mainly belongs to the field of decision&#8209;making with the possibility to determine vectors of priorities for the individuals participating in the decisions under study.

Abstract:
The Spanish healthcare system has undergone important changes, particularly with respect to the development of new hospital services. Today, more than ever, the factors that define the nature and structured of the Spanish healthcare environment (e.g. demand, costs, system deregulation) are undergoing rapid change thus obliging hospital administrators to develop and implement flexible and adaptive strategies in order to survive in an increasingly challenging environment facing hospital management. This work examines how the existence of some learning practices is linked to knowledge transfer and how this component is linked to relational capital. These relationships are examined through an empirical investigation of 54 doctors and 62 nurses belonging to 44 Hospital&#8209;in&#8209;the&#8209;Home Units. In an applied sense, the findings provide homecare practitioners with identifiable factors, which enable two learning models (conceptual and operational) and address the relevant issues by changing strategies at both the individual and organisational levels.

Abstract:
This paper will continue our work concerning the strategic management of intellectual capital. Based on the Rothberg/Erickson SPF framework which balances knowledge development with knowledge protection, we continue to explore differing circumstances and their impact on IC strategy. The framework differentiates between IC that needs to be aggressively developed by the firm (or not) and IC that is vulnerable to competitive intelligence incursion and needs protection (or not). Previously, we have looked at an environment within which substantial development of IC is necessary in order to be competitive but in which those same knowledge assets are at risk from competitive efforts to appropriate them (Erickson & Rothberg 2009b). In this paper, we will develop the scenario wherein aggressive development of IC may not be useful (highly tacit knowledge, difficult to share or apply in other situations) and little competitive intelligence activity is taking place (SPF 5 in the framework). In particular, we will characterize the nature of this environment in terms of theory, identify representative firms and industries, and apply data to the framework. Where appropriate, contrasts with other SPF environments will also be made.

Abstract:
In this study, we sketch a problem&#8209;based perspective of the service business, following the latest theoretical developments in the field of the knowledge&#8209;based view of the firm and the related problem&#8209;solving perspective. In particular, we approach services as problems to be solved for and with the customer. Our paper outlines a framework in which the knowledge processes regarding service delivery are conceptualized on two axes: 1) the intensity of knowledge sharing and co&#8209;creation of services between the provider and the customer and 2) the nature of the problem&#8209;solving process regarding the service delivery. Based on the developed conceptual framework, we provide implications concerning the organizing of various types of services in terms of the different problem&#8209;solving processes they require. Furthermore, after identifying the distinctive problem&#8209;solving processes with the help of the typology, theoretical and practical implications for service and knowledge management are discussed.

Trust&#8209;Building Mechanisms for the Provision of Knowledge&#8209;Intensive Business Services
Pages:

Authors:
Enrico Scarso
Ettore Bolisani
Abstract:
The term knowledge&#8209;intensive business services (KIBS) indicates private companies whose job consists of collecting, generating, analysing, and distributing knowledge with the purpose of delivering customized services to satisfy client’s needs. KIBS firms rely on highly educated professionals, and supply knowledge resources or other knowledge&#8209;based services that clients are unable or unwilling to develop by themselves. The provision of KIBS entails a bilateral exchange of knowledge between the service provider and the end user along with the entire supply cycle. In this process, not only KIBS firms supply clients with precious elements of technical and applicative knowledge, but also client firms provide KIBS with pieces of knowledge that are necessary for designing a successful solution. As is well underlined in the literature, trust is an essential ingredient of client&#8209;provider knowledge exchanges, so that KIBS companies have deal with it properly. This is not simple, since trust has several dimensions that rely on different trust&#8209;building mechanisms. In light of this, the paper aims to analyse the different forms of trust and the related trust&#8209;building mechanisms that come into play during the delivery of a knowledge&#8209;intensive service. This is done by discussing the findings of a multiple case&#8209;study of a particular group of KIBS, i.e. computer service companies located in the Northeast of Italy. Specifically, the study: a) offers a knowledge&#8209;oriented description of the interactions that take place during the service delivery process between client and KIBS firms; b) analyses the role played by the different forms of trust, as antecedents and consequences of each interaction; c) makes some remarks about the trust building mechanisms that a KIBS company can exploit, and the resulting management implications.

The LIFE Technique – Creating a Personal Work Profile

Authors:

Abstract:
This paper focuses on the question: how can a personal work profile be created most easily and effectively for people considering their future? A personal work profile is a detailed description of the skills a person would like to use and characteristics of a work environment they would like to experience. This is valuable for all people of working age because it helps them find, or move towards, work which suits them best. This is tremendously important in Knowledge Management (KM). This is because when the an individual’s knowledge and skills are matched well with the work they conduct, there is a high level of job satisfaction, motivation and performance. Therefore, if there is a good match, employees and organisations benefit enormously. The paper categorises and critically examines literature relevant to the research question and explains why the new Look Into your FuturE (LIFE) technique (‘the LIFE Technique’) was designed, what is new about it, how it works and how it has been road tested, reflected upon and improved. The primary data strongly suggests that the stages of the Technique are useful and easy to do, and that it is a valuable initiative that should be developed and applied further in the future.

The Changing Role of Knowledge in Companies: How to Improve Business Performance Through Knowledge
Pages:
pp73&#8209;84
Authors:
Gaby Neumann
Eduardo Tome
Abstract:
Knowledge is widely accepted as strategic resource in companies, but its developmental potential is often not well exploited. Amongst others this is caused by the wide variety of knowledge management concepts, methods and tools challenging company management in selecting the appropriate measure for the specific company situation and developmental goal. Furthermore, knowledge is directly linked to people and knowledge&#8209;based interventions therefore cannot be successful without reaching the company’s employees and getting them involved in any change processes. Against this background the paper discusses the changing role of knowledge in companies and investigates how knowledge&#8209;based change processes in companies need to be launched and run. Based upon this a methodological framework is proposed in order to help companies in identifying their needs for change and purposefully intervening in their processes and eventually to lend them a hand in managing their human resources, selecting technology or changing the organisation. Conclusions open up the view towards future research still required for achieving the goal of methodologically grounded managerial support and guidelines on how to best intervene in company knowledge.

Building a Knowledge Management Model at Brazil's Embrapa (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation): Towards a Knowledge&#8209;Based View of Organizations

Abstract:
This paper investigates and analyses the process of building a knowledge management (KM) model at Brazil’s Embrapa (The Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation). Embrapa is a world class knowledge organization whose mission is to provide feasible solutions for the sustainable development of Brazilian agribusiness through knowledge and technology generation and transfer. The qualitative research strategy used was the study of a single case with incorporated units of analysis and two criteria were observed for the judgment of the quality of the research project: validity of the construct  and reliability. Multiple sources of evidence were used and data analysis consisted of three flows of activities: data reduction, data displays and conclusion drawing/verification. The results revealed a robust KM model made of four dynamic axes: (i) strategy (a strategic conception of information and knowledge use), (ii) environment &#8209; four different groups of enabling conditions (social&#8209;behavioral, information/communication, cognitive/epistemic and business/managerial), sine qua non conditions for successful implementation, (iii) tool box – sets of IT tools and managerial practices and (iv) results – in terms of outputs, being both tangible and intangible assets. The conclusions suggest that a collaborative building of a KM model in a diverse and geographically dispersed organization is more likely to succeed than one that is build and implemented from the top&#8209;down perspective. Embrapa’s KM Model is more inclined to be a knowledge&#8209;based view of organization than merely a KM model. Limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are also discussed.

Title:
Knowledge Audit with Intellectual Capital in the Quality Management Process: An Empirical Study in an Electronics Company
Pages:
pp98&#8209;116
Authors:
Percy Chi Wai Chan
W.B. Lee
Abstract:
Most of the intellectual capital (IC) assessment tools are based on a “top&#8209;down” approach which does not explore deeply into the particular business process and the specific knowledge needs. Those IC assessment tools generally measure the intellectual capital of an organization as the return on intangible assets covering Human Capital (HC) such as staff skills, innovativeness and work experience, Structural Capital (SC) such as IT systems, documents and patents, and Relational Capital (RC) such as relationship with customers and suppliers. Traditional IC assessment tools with “IC reporting” deliverables aim at identifying useful knowledge that can create wealth for the organization in assessing the performance and value creation process. In contrary, a systematic “knowledge audit” is a process&#8209;oriented and stock&#8209;taking approach for evaluating the “knowledge healthiness” of an organization from the “bottom&#8209;up”. There is potential to merge two methodologies into one integrated assessment tool to present a comprehensive IC reporting in an organization. Knowledge assets underpin the capabilities and core competencies of any organization. The importance of a knowledge audit is the first step in determining how knowledge is handled in mission critical business processes in an organization. Quality management processes are the main subsets inside an organization’s critical business processes. A knowledge audit provides an evidence based assessment of the knowledge assets within an organization, however, there is a lack of a systematic approach in the way knowledge audits are conducted. In addition, there is no standard way of measuring Intellectual Capital (IC) through a better understanding of knowledge assets that are captured from a knowledge audit. The two different streams of KM and IC are complementary and provide the cornerstones for the definition of a managerial framework to identify, assess, exploit and manage organizational knowledge. In view of the importance of the knowledge audit and the deficiencies in the standard ways of IC measurement, a structured knowledge audit approach has been applied. This paper presents an integration of knowledge audit and IC reporting approach which has been applied in a Quality Assurance (QA) Department of an electronics company, for knowledge assets stock&#8209;taking in six specified Value Added Quality Management Processes (VAQMP). More than 74 staff, over 4 corporate functions and 5 departments in two manufacturing plants, from different work levels involving 6 quality management processes from each plant, participated in the research. 52 Participants were provided with various knowledge audit forms to complete in order to provide information about the IT tools/platforms, documents, implicit knowledge, as well as the critical industrial technologies in each VAQMP process. Quantitative and qualitative analysis was then undertaken, including stakeholder analysis and the identification of critical knowledge workers, industrial technologies, crucial documents, implicit knowledge, as well as the knowledge fountain and knowledge discovery points of the process. The outcomes and effectiveness of the knowledge audit were evaluated in both KM and IC aspects. In most Intellectual Capital assessment tools, the workflow of the business process and the specific knowledge needs are not taken into account. On the other hand, this structured knowledge audit helps to identify critical organizational knowledge that needs to be captured and transferred for the healthy operation and sustainability of the quality management processes, in order to prevent quality crises. Finally, after the consolidation of the explicit and implicit knowledge inventories, as well as constructing an IC value tree, an intellectual capital statement for the Group Quality Assurance (GQA) Department was produced.

Title:
Knowledge Management, an Enduring but Confusing Fashion
Pages:
pp117&#8209;131
Authors:
Ken Grant
Abstract:
Knowledge Management has been a subject of significant management interest for some 15 years. During that time it has been subjected to a variety of criticisms including the argument that it is little more than a “fad” — something that catches management’s attention for a while and then fades away because of a lack of sustainability. It has been compared to other major management fads such as quality circles and business process re&#8209;engineering. This paper examines the discipline of Knowledge Management (KM) through the lens of management fashion theory. It demonstrates that KM is not a fad and that it has become an enduring management activity. Management Fashion Theory (Abrahamson and Fairchild, 1999) is an extension of Rogers’ Theory of Diffusion of Innovations (Rogers, 2003), that takes a skeptical view of business innovations, viewing the discourse about and the diffusion of innovations as a cultural phenomenon rather than a rational decision making process. After a brief introduction to the field of Knowledge Management (KM), a review of the theories of Diffusion of Innovations and Management Fashion is presented, along with a description of the methodology used to apply Management Fashion Theory to the discourse on KM. Bibliometric and content analysis techniques are used to examine publications and discourse in the field from 1990 to 2009. The analysis of discourse on KM demonstrates a significant period of “latency” from the late 1980s to 1994, during which foundational ideas and precursors to KM appear. Then a rapid growth period is identified, from 1995&#8209;2001 during which KM becomes an innovation of interest to most major organizations. Finally, it appears that discourse has settled at a steady state, with no decline apparent. However, detailed analysis has also indentified a potential conflict between the interests of practitioners and researchers, with a separation of the discourse into distinct groups that may have inconsistent views on what is or is not “Knowledge Management”. In summary, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of discourse on KM. It provides bibliometric evidence that there has been a sustained interest in KM that is quite unlike that of other popular management themes over the last 30 years. It raises some questions about the relevance of some of the research being carried out.

The Formulaic and Embryonic Dimensions of Knowledge Management Strategy: A Social Practice Perspective
Pages:
pp132&#8209;138
Authors:
Yassaman Imani
Abstract:
Knowledge Management (KM) literature is populated with a variety of perspectives, prescriptions and studies of practice, which can be complex, contradictory and confusing to practitioners who seek to make sense of, and adapt them for practice. A sub&#8209;set of this literature argues that a clear link to business strategy is critical to KM strategy’s success (see Storey & Barnett, 2000; Zack, 1999, 2002), but extant research shows that this link is often weak (Leidner, 1998; Ruggles, 1998; Storey & Barnett, 2000; Zack, 1999). These debates however, adopt a mainly rational perspective which overlooks the ‘emergent’ and ‘sensemaking’ aspects of strategizing. This paper argues that an extended ‘social practice’ (Hendry, 2000), which brings together rational, emergent and sensemaking aspects of strategizing process, provides a useful multi&#8209;perspective framework for investigating the extent to which practitioners’ approach to setting up KM strategies in their firms are influenced by their firms’ business strategies. Using an extended social practice framework, I examined the managerial accounts of the processes of setting up KM strategies in 18 global firms. This study contributes to a better of understanding of the ways in which business strategy influences the KM strategizing process. The findings support extant research by suggesting that a weak link between KM and business strategy existed in these firms. However, this study demonstrates that from the social practice perspective, firms take two different approaches to their KM strategy, formulaic (to support their routine activities) and embryonic (to address their immediate strategic agenda), which signify their enduring and transient KM practices. Finally, this study concludes that further research is needed to explore the dynamic interactions between the formulaic and embryonic KM approaches.

Implementing Knowledge Through Development Projects
Pages:
pp139&#8209;148
Authors:
Erik Laursen
Abstract:
The main objective of this article is the implementation of knowledge in organizations, taking place in the context of development projects. Some of the issues discussed are: What kind of learning conditions do the development projects have to offer? What are the causes and consequences of different levels of engagement from the staff in the projects? Why is often so difficult to transfer what is learned or implemented by the organization during the projects to the everyday activities of the organization after the finishing of projects? In the article a typology of development projects is presented and discussed as different ways of framing the organizational learning processes. The article is based on an empirical study of four organizational development projects (covering the organizations as a whole) run by four Danish upper secondary schools(“gymnasium”). The study included questionnaires as well as interviews with the management and staff, plus a survey of selected written materials and documents . In the various ways in which different groupings among the staff and the management are relating to the project are described. A special focus is set on the different perspectives on the projects established by the staff and the management and how the perspectives have consequences on the actual learning outcomes of the different groups in the organization. Another issue is the weak links between what is experienced by the staff as ‘ordinary problems’ his objectives and goals of the development projects. The theoretical frame of analysis has references to the ‘outside&#8209;in’ perspective on organizational learning, presented by the neo&#8209;institutional theory (Scott 1995 DiMaggion& Powell 1983, Czarniawska & Sevon 2005, Røvik 2007) Nanoka and Takeuchis model of knowledge transformations in organizations (Nonaka & Takeuchi 1995) and of the forms of the knowledge), Argyris and Ellström’s distinction between the learning modes of correction and development (Ellström 2001, Argyris 1992).

Key Performance Indicators Metrics Effect on the Advancement and Sustainability of Knowledge Management

Mohamed Rabhi
Abstract:
This paper addresses the relationship between the value of data and KPs as they relate to the sustainability of knowledge management (KM). Numerical data are compelling metrics to persuade executives and management in the organization of the significance of Knowledge Management. External statistics are usually less impactful than internal data. Nonetheless, and in the absence of internal data at the early phases of KM projects, many companies collect published data for comparable industries. In the present case, we compiled information from previous experiences of companies in the same line of business; therefore, management by&#8209;in was secured, and the KM project was, to some extent, successfully implemented.  However, there was a need to generate in&#8209;house numbers to support promises and claims of KM benefits, and persuade all KM players from the technician to the organisation president; the ultimate objective is to have a sustainable Knowledge Management project across the organization, with visible, concrete, and quantifiable results. Equipped with the assertion “data is power”, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and other metrics were devised and integrated into our KM processes; these measurements are being pulled out systematically, and published to the whole audience. KPIs measured included the effect of KM on (i) customer satisfaction, (ii) business impact (i.e. savings), (iii) number of projects completed on time, (iv) and the number of technical reports generated per unit of research area. Over the past few years, the data we generated shows a considerable increase in customer satisfaction with our research and technical services; significant savings were obtained each year; project timely completion indicator rose to high levels as compared to previous yearly data; the electronic technical and scientific library experienced a build up of valuable know&#8209;how reports. Knowledge re&#8209;use as shown by reliance on internal resources was the standard and routine practice. On the other hand, many other qualitative observations, like effect on health, safety, and the environment are being quantified for inclusion in the KPI reporting. Based on the accumulated data, we believe that numerical values coupled with other tangible solid results will ensure a viable and sustainable KM in our organization. This hypothesis is supported by five year data and trend analysis.  It confirms that internally generated statistics is a powerful tool to sway and re&#8209;assure the organization that KM can indeed increase efficiency, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive savings.

Abstract:
Organizational innovation has been viewed as an essential weapon for organizations to compete in this competitive business environment. Particularly, Malaysia manufacturing firms strive to transform their business model from labor&#8209;intensive to knowledge&#8209;intensive, which aim to immerse themselves in higher value added activities such as, developing new products, processes, and services, to continual sustain the competitiveness within the rivalries. One of the ways to heighten the organizational innovation is through effective human resource management (HRM) practices and effective knowledge management. This study examined the direct relationships between HRM practices (performance appraisal, career management, training, reward system, and recruitment) and organizational innovation (product innovation, process innovation, and administrative innovation). Additionally, it also examined the mediating role of KM effectiveness on the direct relationship. Data was drawn from a sample of 171 large manufacturing firms in Malaysia. The regression results showed that HRM practices generally have a positive effect on organizational innovation. Specifically, the findings indicate that training was positively related to three dimensions of organizational innovation (product innovation, process innovation, and administrative innovation). Performance appraisal also found to have a positive effect on administrative innovation. Additionally, this study also demonstrates that training and performance appraisal, are positively related to knowledge management effectiveness. Knowledge management effectiveness fully mediates the relationship between training and process innovation, training and administrative innovation, and performance appraisal and administrative innovation. A discussion of the findings, limitations, and implications are provided.

Abstract:
Danish society puts a high value on education which is traditionally seen as a crucial vehicle for development in all spheres of social and economic life. Large sums are spent on work&#8209;related adult learning, an important example being academically based masters programs. Yet, the actual effects of such educational investment in terms of improved workplace efficiency remain obscure both with respect to the organization and the individual. The three authors of this article are all involved in planning, managing and teaching at masters programs at Aalborg University, Denmark. Programs are carefully designed with a view to strengthening the link between the educational space (the curriculum and academic priorities) and the students’ habitual working environment (the organizations from which they come). Starting from a theoretical viewpoint based on traditional learning theory, supplemented by research in the field of transfer of training, as well as on Donald A. Schön’s classic work on practicum as a crucial component in the training of practitioners, our article presents, and illustrates with examples, a framework for designing educational programs which can help make academic teaching relevant to production&#8209;oriented life in organizations. The article may be read as a statement from which criteria for evaluating the said masters programs can be generated.

Abstract:
During his keynote address at 3rd European Conference on Intellectual Capital held at University of Nicosia, Cyprus, 18&#8209;19 April 2011, John Girard posed the question, Are You Ready for the Future? This rather rhetorical question was designed to create a conversation about what we should expect in the future in terms of social technology, leadership and a culture of collaboration. Throughout the conference, an excellent dialogue ensued about what the future might hold.  The central focus of this discourse surrounded how collaboration could or should change in the future. The genesis of the keynote was the research completed by John Girard, Cindy Gordon, JoAnn Girard for their recent book Business Goes Virtual: Realizing the Value of Collaboration, Social and Virtual Strategies. This article is adapted from the book and focuses on why business leaders should consider focussing on collaboration.

Title:
Virtual Embeddedness and Social Media as a Basis for the Relational Capital Management of new Ventures

Abstract:
New forms of data storage and transfer as well as new methods to communicate, collaborate and exchange knowledge at diminishing transaction costs over the world&#8209;wide&#8209;web have revolutionised networking, knowledge creation and innovation processes in the knowledge era. Virtual embeddedness signifies the possibility to draw upon pay&#8209;per&#8209;use computing resources and a variety of customised web services and applications. The facilitated utilisation of Software&#8209;as&#8209;a&#8209;Service and in particular social media (SM) applications enables effective networking on platforms and in virtual communities in social as well as in business terms. Such networking processes lead to the accumulation of social, relational and intellectual capital, as they facilitate information and knowledge exchange, integration and creation. Since information and knowledge sharing, collaboration and socialising take virtual dimensions, opportunities and threats arise for enterprises regarding relational capital management (RCM) as well as knowledge and value creation. Most new ventures are keen on utilising SM for internal and external communication and collaboration purposes. In this context, the question of how new ventures can improve their RCM through the utilisation of innovative information and communication technologies (ICT) and SM arises. To answer this question, ventures have to grasp the potential of web technologies and SM and to assess their appropriability to achieve relationship&#8209;specific goals. They need to be aware of SM risks in order to exploit chances and avert threats which arise through SM use. In this paper, the question of how to exploit the benefits of virtual embeddedness and Web 2.0 in order to optimise the RCM of new ventures is discussed. To provide a basis for this discussion, the qualities of social and relational capital and the different forms of physical and virtual embeddedness are analysed. The utilisation of SM for RCM purposes and the implementation of a SM strategy are exemplified in the case study of a German eCommerce venture that took advantage of web technologies to build up and manage its relational capital in virtual and physical dimensions. Finally, a conceptual model describing the contribution of virtual embeddedness and SM to knowledge, value and reputation creation is proposed and illustrated by means of the case study.

Khodayar Abili
Abstract:
The importance of social capital and its effective management approach in organizations, particularly knowledge&#8209;based organizations, for assuring their ongoing and sustainable development and competitive advantage has been a matter of serious discussion in recent years. Considering the ongoing expansion and growth of knowledge&#8209;based organizations in Iran and the role and importance of their social capital in further development of Iranian society, an effective system of management of their social capital is a matter of concern of their top managers. Therefore, a blend (quantitative and qualitative) multiple case study was conducted with a selected number of knowledge&#8209;based organizations with different sizes to assess their existing social capital, to identify factors which might have positive or negative impacts on the promotion of their social capital and to propose an effective approach for its management. To conduct the study, a purposive sample of fifteen large organizations and sixteen SMEs was selected. To collect the data, a stratified random sample of 528 knowledge workers (336 from large and 192 from MEs) and their HRM managers were given a 24&#8209;item questionnaire which was designed based on three dimensions (structural, relational and cognitive) of Organizational Social Capital Model used by Nahapiet and Ghoshal in their study. This was followed by semi&#8209;structured interviews with a selected number of research participants for completion and further clarification of collected data. Findings indicated that the selected knowledge&#8209;based organizations are not benefiting from a desirable social capital. It is even worse in large organizations. Therefore, some measures need to be taken to improve the situation. Based on the findings of this study, suggestions were provided for the promotion of their social capitals and their more effective management

Title:
Developing and Implementing Strategies to Enhance Intellectual Capital in the Online Learning Environment
Pages:
pp211&#8209;220
Authors:
Bob Barrett
Abstract:
The online learning environment has become a highly competitive industry in which many stakeholders have become more interested and involved in its overall operation. One particular area that most stakeholders will agree upon is the value of human capital in this industry. Stewart (1997) classified Intellectual Capital into three key areas: human capital, structural capital, and customer capital. This paper will focus on the human capital element in the online learning environment. Human capital is explained as the capabilities of the companys employees necessary to provide solutions to customers, to innovate and to renew. As a result of changing technology and economic times, many organizations are realizing the need to update, innovate, and rejuvenate. InCaS (2010) noted that As a result of constant changes caused by globalisation, emerging technologies and shorter product life&#8209;cycles, knowledge and innovation have already become the main competitive advantages of many companies. Especially European small and medium&#8209;sized enterprises (SME) are highly dependent on the ability to identify changes in their global economic environment quickly and respond to these changes with suitable solutions. (p. 4) Just liked their European counterparts, American enterprises and organizations are scanning their environments and focusing on responding to potential changes in order to capture and maintain their market share and prepare for the future. In additional in individual capabilities, human capital includes the dynamics of an intelligent (learning) organization in a changing competitive environment, its creativity, and innovativeness (Stewart, 1997, p. 13). Thus, there has been an increase in the focus as to how online learning providers are investing more money and time in preparing their online instructional staff. Sokolowska (2006) commented that if we look at learning organizations we can see two types of trends. She stated that such organizations are understood in dynamic organizational categories that are oriented at their development, searches for new chances on the market and continually increases their effectiveness, efficiency and flexibility. The second group of learning organizations consists of such entities that choose growth through development of their employees. (p. 158) This paper examines the online learning environment, requirements for the online instructional staff, and strategies to help better prepare and develop their intellectual capital in this particular learning environment. Further, this paper will examine how these strategies are reinforced by the commitment of the educational institution in terms of preparing their online instructors, as well as mentoring them along the way.

Title:
IC and Knowledge Formation by Hidden Structures  Long Term Costs of new Technology and Participative Design
Pages:
pp221&#8209;235
Authors:
Klaus Bruno Schebesch
Abstract:
Many innovative businesses formed around energy or bio&#8209;related activities, for instance, are often the result of collective action of organisations involved in many&#8209;sided markets, which can be found in and around focusing environments such as business incubators or tech¬no¬logy centres. Within such environments, group interests beyond those of single producers and their immediate clients exist and interfere. Rather generically, important economic outcomes of innovations are se¬quen¬ces of cost reduc¬¬tion events, the pace of which is influenced by technology and networking alike. Moreover, new products or technologies are producing long term costs difficult to anticipate, which eventually, in response to private and public awareness and knowledge formation, will have to be inter¬nalized. More traditional industries like textiles rely in general on conservative business models and use new technology in rather restricted ways. Product design is fashion orien¬ted and there¬fore predominantly “artistic” in nature, distribution channels are directed towards out¬lets facilitating physical contact of clients with the produce. New technology enters main¬ly via more mechanized production cycles for a given set of narrowly defined final products. The formation of Intellectual Capital (IC) in such industries is a slow. The presence of low creativity products indicates underutilization of both new product concepts and tech¬nological possi¬bilities. Participative design procedures for new product concepts using appropriate eCommerce features point here towards a way out. Such features include well adapted recommender systems based on trust creation and opinion formation. We propose to model the effects of these long term costs of new technology and the possibly complementary effects of participative design procedures by economic agents acting within specific adaptable neighbourhoods and by formation of some trust related assets. Thereafter, the influ¬ence exerted between firms is increasing in firm similarity, in the degree of product complementarity, and it also depends on (mutual) trust relations. A sustainable innovation is more expensive than a regular one but it may lead to long term benefits and to durable competitive advantage, espe¬cially if many firms from the network collude. The associated opinion formation process which leads to sustainable innovation may be viewed as a collec¬tive cognitive process resem¬bling that of branding and re&#8209;branding. A similar trust&#8209;based opinion formation is also regarded as part of a pro¬ce¬dure for assessing the acceptance of many new or parallel product concepts as they derive from Participative design procedures anticipating future product uses. Stylized dynamic models, which entail an opinion formation process, can in turn be identified with different levels of sustainability commitment by innovating and imitating firms within a dynamic multi&#8209;firm setting. Such models tend to display the statistical behaviour of some aggregates known to occur in empirical innovative processes.

Modeling Organizational Knowledge Dynamics: Using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)

Abstract:
: Modelling Organizational Knowledge Dynamics (OKD) is important in developing knowledge strategies within the framework of strategic management. We present in this paper a new perspective on modelling OKD based on the dynamic equilibrium equation of the organizational knowledge, and on using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The dynamic equilibrium equation is considered for a time interval ∆T, and contains the following terms: the level of total organizational knowledge variation ∆K, the knowledge creation variation ∆C, the knowledge acquisition variation ∆A, and the knowledge loss variation ∆L. Since each of these terms has a different relative importance in the organizational knowledge balance, it is necessary to find a way of evaluating their weighting factors. For this purpose we use the AHP mathematical model developed by Saaty for the managerial decision making. AHP requires a structuring of the field of knowledge, and we considered a structure composed of three levels: (1) the goal level – increasing the level of organizational knowledge; (2) the strategies level – the strategy for increasing knowledge creation (S1), the strategy for increasing acquisition of new knowledge (S2), and the strategy for reducing knowledge loss (S3); (3) the activities level – hiring new valuable human resources (A1), developing training programs (A2), creating a performing motivation of employees (A3), and purchasing books, journals, software programs, and other information materials (A4). This structured model of AHP has been applied as an empirical research within a large company. We sent questionnaire to a number of 500 employees, and received valid answers from 173 respondents. The AHP method is based on paired comparisons of strategies with respect to the goal of increasing the level organizational knowledge, and then on paired comparisons of activities with respect to each strategy we defined. These paired comparisons yield matrices that lead to systems of eigenvalue equations whose solutions compose the vector of priorities for strategies, and for activities with respect to each strategy. Values of the vector of priorities for strategies are the weighting factors for the equilibrium equation components.

Abstract:
Knowledge workers represent more than half of all employees in advanced economies. In general knowledge workers are people who, when working, use their brain more than their muscles. Agricultural and industrial worlds depended on the work of manual workers and the life standard of their inhabitants and the success of agricultural and industrial organizations grew due to the increase of manual worker productivity. Existing knowledge economy depends on the work of knowledge workers and the labour productivity they can achieve. Knowledge is a major resource and tool that knowledge workers use to create values. Therefore, the way work with knowledge is organized in an organization influences the productivity of knowledge workers. This article discusses the results of research on knowledge management in organizations in the Czech Republic. This research started at the University of Economics, Prague in 2004 and continues today.

Abstract:
In this paper we show that it is possible to measure the development and management of knowledge in a country using indicators of intellectual capital that consider non visible assets not included in Gross Domestic Product. Using this idea, we obtained a measure of the intellectual capital for 72 countries selected in accordance with the information available for 2000, 2005 and 2008. These measures allows us to verify the hypothesis that knowledge acts as a divergent factor of wealth, that is, that rich countries are richer in knowledge and manage it more efficiently than poor countries. Thus, in a global economy, intellectual capital circulates in the opposite direction to development, that is, from poor to rich countries. In this sense, economic growth in developing countries displays a stronger relationship with intellectual capital. We show how national intellectual capital anticipated the economic crisis before GDP, as real GDP averages increase in all the years considered, whereas national intellectual capital decreased in last year analysed. Moreover, we used a data panel model with common coefficients to emphasize the most influential factor in the recession in order to ascertain the areas where governments must act to overcome a crisis.

Abstract:
In this paper we offered a new approach towards analysis of Intangible Assets. The conceptual framework of our research was based on taxonomy proposed by Contractor (2000) and we focused our study on intangible assets that formed uncodified human capital. The aim of this research was to discriminate the most crucial intangible assets that were absolutely indispensible in the organisational value creation. On the basis of a questionnaire tool we constructed an Information Table according to Pawlak (1982).Next we applied Rough Sets method to analyse our data. The choice of the data analysis technique was determined by numerous advantages associated with Rough Sets that were not so obvious in turn when considering traditional statistical methods. Consequently we obtained a set of intangible assets that were absolutely necessary in the organisational value creation process. This set was form by 14 different indicators that embraced aspects related to training, competencies and culture. Nearly all of them had a qualitative character. In relation to training, apart from the trainings frequency and quality, such aspects as knowledge dissemination and evaluation of the need for training were highlighted. Despite of being under in the area of Training, the aspect of cooperation was emphasized in the area of Competencies. In that section, apart from the requirement of particular knowledge necessary in each position, importance was placed on soft skills like motivation, team building and cooperation. In the area of organisational culture,  there were two elements of importance: the level of freedom when performing duties and the degree to which management attends to employees problems. Consequently, we can conclude that despite belonging to various sections, all of the crucial intangible assets stressed the absolute importance of the active participation of employees in the organisational decision making. This constitutes clear evidence of the important role of Intellectual Capital in corporate value creation.

Abstract:
Intellectual capital can be a major factor that can aid Caribbean policy makers as the region transitions from its agricultural based economy to service based economies with tourism being the largest contributor to GDP. This paper adds to the extant literature by providing literature on IC within the Caribbean and the tourism industry. Additionally, while the research has emphasized defining and measuring IC and its components, and their impact on firm’s performance theoretical questions remain concerning the synergistic, dynamic and contextual nature of IC. In addition, the use of sensemaking to provide the foundation for understanding the interaction of the IC components and firm’s performance will further enhance the IC literature. This paper reports on the development and testing of a theoretical model concerning the mediating effects of measurement of IC and sensemaking on the components of IC and performance linkage. This quantitative study used structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the model and structural relationships among the components of IC and performance mediated by sensemaking and measurement of IC. Independent variables used in the model were HC, RC and SC; with sensemaking and measurement of IC being the mediating variables and performance, a composite scale measuring managers’ perception on relative changes of their performance of financial and non&#8209;financial measures, being the dependent variable. The study shows that HC, RC and SC are related to sensemaking, that measurement of IC is associated with performance, that measurement of IC mediates the relationships between RC and performance and SC and performance, and it validates the relationship between HC and performance.

A Process View of Knowledge Management: It Aint What you do, its the way That you do it

Authors:
John Edwards
Abstract:
Knowledge management needs to consider the three related elements of people, processes and technology. Much existing work has concentrated on either people or technology, often to the exclusion of the other two elements. Yet without thinking about process  the way people, organisations and even technology actually do things  any implementation of a knowledge management initiative is at best risky, and at worst doomed to failure. This paper looks at various ways in which a process view has appeared, explicitly or implicitly, in knowledge management research and practice so far, and reflects on how more thinking about process might improve knowledge management in the future. Consistent with this overall viewpoint, the issues generally centre less on what a process view would suggest should be done, but rather on the way that it would be implemented in practice.

Abstract:
The knowledge being shared for cooperation may also be useful for competitive purposes. Whilst this situation is acknowledged, there is no through analysis of how it has been investigated and treated in prior research studies. This paper reviews the literature on simultaneous cooperative and competitive knowledge sharing. It also contributes to this area through an analytical review that compares the literature linked to this phenomenon and identifies their strengths and limitations. The analysis of the findings suggests that efforts in this area have been undertaken independently and with little consideration of the prior studies in different but related realms. The findings suggest the benefits of integrating different bodies of literature in building on a broader platform of existing epistemological and ontological foundations.

Knowledge Transfer Procedures From Consultants to Users in ERP Implementations

Authors:
Przemyslaw Lech
Abstract:
This paper focuses on the issue of knowledge transfer from consultants to the final users of the ERP system during its implementation. For a long time, the knowledge transfer has been recognized as one of the key success factors of the implementation projects of any type. Basing on the literature, two alternative approaches to the knowledge transfer were identified: an exploration oriented one, assuming users active participation in the implementation process and another one, i.e. instruction oriented knowledge transfer, depending on the users training provided by the consultants after the implementation has been completed. A study of 10 ERP implementation projects is presented to determine how enterprises solve the knowledge transfer issue in real&#8209;life environment. At the end the paper presents the evaluation of the amount of external workload from the consultants needed to accomplish the knowledge transfer process with the use of the two alternative approaches. It is based on the field study in two comparable enterprises. The main value of the research is that it presents the generalization of the knowledge transfer procedures used in real&#8209;life ERP projects and then evaluates the difference in external workload from the consultants in a very unique situation of two very similar enterprises, with comparable business processes and information requirements, and which implemented the same ERP system with help of the same external consultants but using different knowledge transfer approach.

In Search of the Golden Mean: The Ambivalence of Knowledge Explication

Authors:
Georg Hans Neuweg

Abstract:
Knowledge Management (KM) tends to regard the explication of knowledge as thoroughly positive. In this paper, we argue that this attitude rests on misconceptions regarding the nature of implicit knowledge and knowledge explication. Rather than following undifferentiated imperatives to maximise the amount of explicit knowledge, practitioners of KM are better off considering the ambivalent effects of knowledge explication. For this purpose, we suggest applying the Tacit Knowing View (Neuweg, 2004) and Contingency Theory to the problem of determining the right level of explication. The paper is divided into four parts. In the first part we trace KMs need for the explication and formalisation of knowledge. In the second part, we address theoretical misconceptions. First, we apply Ryles finding that sloppy language use may lead to illegitimate assumptions toward explication. Secondly, we argue that, albeit superficial references to the work of Polanyi can be found throughout KM, actual epistemological positions rather seem to follow Popper. In the third part, we systematise limitations, problems, and side effects of explication. In the fourth part, we suggest the heuristic concept of explication optima as a framework for developing KM activities.

Abstract:
In the current advanced era, knowledge and the applications of it are the essence of organizations for achieving competing advantage and defined as a new strategic approach to innovation and a potential element for creating larger market share. Understanding the knowledge management process in terms of banking sector will highlight how it influences organizational performance. In a developing country like Iran, it is also showing signs of competition and improved performance through knowledge management; however whether the knowledge management process is practiced in Iranian banks is still to be explored. In response to this need, this research explores the key processes and technologies of knowledge management being used in the commercial banks of Iran in order to give an insight for bankers and strategist to understand its importance.

Contextual Adaptive Knowledge Visualization Environments

Abstract:
As an essential component of knowledge management systems, visualizations assist in creating, transferring and sharing knowledge in a wide range of contexts where knowledge workers need to explore, manage and get insights from tremendous volumes of data. Knowledge visualization context may incorporate any information in regard to the decisional problem context within which visualizations are applied, the visualization profiles of knowledge workers as well as their intended purposes. Due to the inherent dynamic nature, these contextual factors may cause the changing visualization requirements and difficulties in maintaining the effectiveness of a knowledge visualization when contextual changes occur. To address the contextual complexities, visualization systems to support knowledge management need to provide flexible support for the creation, manipulation, transformation and improvement of visualization solutions. Furthermore, they should be able to sense, analyze and respond to the contextual changes so as to support in maintaining the effectiveness of the solutions. In addition, they need to possess the capability to mediate between the problem and the knowledge workers through provision of action and presentation languages. However, many visualization systems tend to provide weak support for fulfilling these system requirements. They do not provide adequate flexibility for adapting the visualizations to fit different knowledge visualization contexts. This motivated us to propose and implement a flexible knowledge visualization system for better aiding knowledge creation, transfer and sharing, namely, Contextual Adaptive Visualization Environment (CAVE). CAVE provides flexible support for (1) sensing and being aware of changes in the problem, purpose and/or knowledge worker contexts, (2) interpreting the changes through relevant analysis and (3) responding to the changes through appropriate re&#8209;design and re&#8209;modelling of visual compositions to address the problem. In order to fulfil the requirements posed above, we developed and proposed conceptual models and frameworks which are further elucidated through system&#8209;oriented architectures and implementations.

Abstract:
The rapid development of virtual worlds has created new possibilities for supporting formal and informal knowledge acquisition and learning processes online. Consequently, greater immersion of “knowledge workers” in cooperation and communication tasks in social virtual worlds should be a more prominent topic in sociological and cognitive&#8209;psychological research designs. The relatively new social potential of virtual worlds can be examined using theoretical models that describe the use and assessment of virtual world technologies in contexts of knowledge acquisition and exchange. In this paper, three co&#8209;created scenarios will be described to help demonstrate how virtual worlds can be used to explore new forms of interaction in (virtual) social contexts. These scenarios and the results of the avatar&#8209;based ethnographic investigation during the process of co&#8209;creation and collaboration will be introduced and used to reflect on the 3D projects. Afterwards, two sets of criteria to evaluate 3D environments for learning and teaching will be presented. The paper ends with suggestions for further research concerning the effects of immersion during collaboration and education in virtual worlds and an outlook on other upcoming 3D projects.

Abstract:
Nowadays knowledge is becoming an increasingly important factor of organizational competitiveness. The way it is shared within the organization is essential and central not only to the success of organizations but also among those who share it, since those who take part in the knowledge sharing process also benefit from it. Since middle managers have an important position within the organization and play a significant role in the knowledge sharing process, this paper focuses on the knowledge sharing of those middle managers who work at medium and large&#8209;sized enterprises in Hungary. A new method of how to measure middle managers’ maturity of knowledge sharing is presented in this paper. Between 2007 and 2010 an empirical survey was conducted during which 400 middle managers working at medium&#8209; and large&#8209;sized enterprises in Hungary were investigated by a questionnaire. The answers of this survey have been analysed using Principal Component Analysis and four different principal components concerning the maturity of knowledge sharing have been identified. These four components are the availability among middle managers, the availability among the middle managers and their subordinates, the usefulness of knowledge among middle managers and the usefulness of knowledge among the middle managers and their subordinates.

Understanding Personal Knowledge Development in Online Learning Environments: An Instrument for Measuring Externalisation, Combination and Internalisation

Abstract:
This paper investigates personal knowledge development in online learning environments using the perspective of a model adapted from Nonaka and colleagues’ SECI model. To this end, the SECI model, which was originally designed to describe organisational knowledge creation and conversion, was adapted to conceptualise personal knowledge development in online learning at the individual level. As the SECI model was originally conceived at the organisational level, in order to measure personal knowledge development at the individual level in the context of online learning, a measurement instrument was created in order to measure the scores of individual online learners on Externalisation, Combination and Internalisation. It is argued that Socialisation is not a relevant mode in the context of online learning and is therefore not covered in the measurement instrument; this is explained further in the paper. This measurement instrument also examines the interrelationships between the three modes and a new model – the so&#8209;called EC&#8209;I model – is proposed to depict these interrelationships. The measurement instrument is based on data collected through an online survey, in which online learners report on their experiences of personal knowledge development in online learning environments. In other words, the instrument measures the magnitude of online learners’ Externalisation and Combination activities as well as their level of Internalisation, i.e. the outcomes of their personal knowledge development in online learning. For Externalisation and Combination, formative indicators were used, whereas for Internalisation reflective indicators were used. The measurement instrument is one of the main foci of this paper and is therefore discussed in&#8209;depth. In sum, the paper proposes a modified version of the SECI model, extending the applicability of the original SECI model from the organisational to the individual level. It outlines a new measurement instrument which can be used to measure Externalisation and Combination, i.e. personal knowledge development processes, and Internalisation, i.e. personal knowledge development outcomes.

Abstract:
An organisation’s ability to successfully compete in a changing market place is contingent on its ability to manage what it knows, in order to serve the objectives of the firm. While it has been argued that due to their size, knowledge management (KM) is not a concern for smaller organisations, in the current economic climate, it is expected that a more formalised approach to KM allows the company to seize opportunities as they arise, and deal with environmental uncertainty more effectively. In view of this, the objective of this study was to devise a classification of knowledge activities (KAs) which facilitates the exploration of a Small to Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) in terms of the type and extent to which knowledge is managed.  Furthermore, analysis of KAs provided a greater understanding of the fit between the firm’s objectives and the KM approach pursued. In order to achieve this, five case studies were conducted. Based on the classification of KAs identified, a qualitative analysis approach was used to code each of the twenty eight interviews carried out.  Both quantitative and qualitative content analysis methods were applied to facilitate data reduction and generate meaning from the significant volume of data collected. The output from this study includes a classification of KAs which provides rich insight into how SMEs are motivated to deal with knowledge as a means of achieving their organisational objectives. From a practitioner viewpoint, this study seeks to offer an improved understanding of a software SMEs’ approach to KM.

Abstract:
Knowledge&#8209;oriented organizations are bricks for the knowledge&#8209;based society construction. Building knowledge&#8209;based society and economy suppose challenging transition processes from the classical structure of an organization to new organizational forms that help to fill the gap between actual society and the future knowledge&#8209;based society and economy. This transition generates new issues in knowledge creation and sharing processes, related to the particularities of the new organizational forms. Therefore, in the last few years, our researches are oriented to developing and testing a number of forms of organization designed to facilitate an efficient and effective transition toward the knowledge&#8209;based society, like communities of practice, (virtual) networks of professionals or knowledge ecosystems (KE). Under this general frame, this paper presents the results of our research aiming to capture the necessary changes that a medical organization specialized in rehabilitation (the National Institute of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine from Bucharest, Romania &#8209; INRMFB) has to undertake for converting its classical structure into a new knowledge&#8209;oriented one, possible and easily to being integrated into a Virtual Network for Home Health Rehabilitation of the impaired people – the meta goal of our research in recent years. Specifically, within its five sections, the paper outlines: 1. An introduction in the macro and micro&#8209;level empirical setting in which the study is carried out; 2. The methodological approach based on Social Network Analysis (SNA). Although quit often used in the medical field, as we will see in the second section of the paper, the SNA methods and models aren’t used yet in the particular area of health rehabilitation; 3. The objectives of the empirical study that can be summarized as follows: Mapping of the knowledge flows & needs in the target community of practice. The aim of this step is to produce an accurate picture of the knowledge flows that the target community identified at the INRMFB actually enacts in the accomplishment of its organizational objectives. Analysis & Diagnosis: Identification of critical aspects and areas of improvements (e.g. knowledge needs, knowledge bottlenecks, structural determinants of inefficiency or of poor performance). Design: definition of the functional specifications for redesigning the agents, network and of the functionalities of Knowbots. 4. The survey we have designed for data collection. According with the particularities of the macro and micro&#8209;level in which our study is carried out, we have designed a survey that will help us both for diagnosing the knowledge&#8209;sharing&#8209;structure of INRMFB, and for finding adequate solutions for potential critical aspects identified in this medical facility.; 5. A set of conclusions and recommendations for the new knowledge&#8209;oriented organizational structure to be created within the INRMFB. Alongside with performing SNA in the health rehabilitation field, an important output of our study is to find answer to the following questions: Cans the classical organizational structure of the INRMFB be transformed into a knowledge&#8209;based one, by reengineering the knowledge flows and agent’s roles? If and where within the actual structure a virtual knowledge agent (knowbot) can and should be integrated? Our paper is a consequent continuation of our work in the KE area, contributing to the completion of an integrate vision over the role of the KM techniques, human and virtual agents in the emerging of knowledge&#8209;based society. It presents a work still in progress, the final results of our study going to be presented within the ECKM2011 conference.

Knowledge Management Practices and Healthcare Delivery: A Contingency Framework
Pages:

Abstract:
Being a knowledge driven process, healthcare delivery provides opportunity to incorporate knowledge management practices to improve processes. But it has also been noted that knowledge management is systematically more complex in healthcare and minimal research exist to guide academic and organizational stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the application and impact of knowledge management practices in healthcare delivery. The paper is conceptual in its nature and aims to propose a contingency&#8209;based framework to drive further empirical research. The paper is primarily based on a literature review of the healthcare knowledge management and associated information sciences research streams. The fundamental research questions are: ‘‘what and how do the various knowledge management practices affect the performance of healthcare delivery?’’ and ‘‘what are the contingent and contextual factors that needs to be considered when exploring the relationship between knowledge management practices and performance of healthcare delivery?’’ We first discuss facets of performance in healthcare delivery but thereafter focus on the technical and interpersonal care aspects of healthcare delivery.  We investigate knowledge management practices in the areas of (i) knowledge acquisition and sharing, (ii) knowledge assimilation and application. In our paper we explore how the different knowledge management practices affect the performance of healthcare delivery through technical and interpersonal care. Thereafter we explore the factors of physician characteristic, ailment characteristics, organizational IT infrastructure and organization processes, on which the conceptual framework will be contingent on. We thereafter evaluate the conceptual framework with a case study. From an academic perspective our paper identifies some key knowledge management practices and explores their linkages with technical and interpersonal care, while from a practical point of view it provides implications for administrators and practitioners in healthcare delivery on the management of contingency factors so that the knowledge management practices can be properly implemented.

Abstract:
Knowledge sharing and creation are considered key processes leading to innovation and organizational performance. Several organizational initiatives have focused on building communities of practice in order to create a platform where employees can share experiences and insights. The focus in this paper is on one type of network structure, termed distributed networks of knowledge (DNoK). The success of such practices is deeply linked to whether or not formalization of the networks can hamper their knowledge creation and creativity. The role of leadership has been extensively discussed in the setting of communities of practice. However, this paper intends to shed new light on the topic by exploring the boundary management perspective in order to enable knowledge sharing and creation within this specific context of DNoK. To this end, we have examined the role of leadership styles in different DNoKs in a multinational firm.

The Potential of Neuro&#8209;Linguistic Programming in Human Capital Development
Pages:
pp131&#8209;141
Authors:
Eric Kong
Abstract:
Human capital (HC) represents the cumulative tacit knowledge that is embedded in the minds of people in organisations. HC is important to organisations because it serves as a source of innovation and strategic renewal. Individuals carry HC when they join an organisation and take their talent, skills and tacit knowledge with them when they leave the organisation. Thus HC is volatile in nature. Organisations are therefore keen to do what they can to foster and develop HC as a means of achieving sustainable competitive advantage. This paper argues that neuro&#8209;linguistic programming (NLP) has the potential of developing and enhancing the stock of HC in organisations. NLP emerged in the 1970s from the University of California, USA. NLP suggests that subjective experience is encoded in terms of three main representation systems: visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic (VAK). NLP practitioners claim that people tend to have one preferred representation system over another in a given context. Despite that previous research has shown that NLP can assist in facilitating knowledge and learning capabilities, very limited research is conducted using NLP in nurturing HC in organisations. This paper critically reviews the literature and theoretically argues that NLP can be used as a practical approach to develop HC in organisations. This is because NLP primarily focuses on individual internal learning and that learning likely leads to the accumulation of HC in organisations. In other words, organisational members may find it more effective to enhance their tacit knowledge, both individually and collectively, if they adopt the NLP approach in their day&#8209;to&#8209;day work. Examples on how NLP may be used to develop HC in organisations will be provided. Future research direction and limitations will also be discussed.

How to Characterize Professional Gestures to Operate Tacit Know&#8209;How Transfer?
Pages:
pp142&#8209;153
Authors:
Sophie Le Bellu
Benoit Le Blanc
Abstract:
Operational knowledge in industries is difficult to capture because of the tacit nature of gestures. Our experiments showed that the operators can be equipped with video capture devices. Professional workers can also be invited to describe the intentions of their gesture. But the bottleneck is in the gesture itself. This paper describes an experiment, which was performed at EDF (Electricité de France), the French leader energy producer company. Several categories of professional gestures were studied and were investigated to produce training video material called “MAP” (Multimedia Apprenticeship Platform). The capture protocol aims to collect operators’ intentions, their mental models. An anthropocentric three&#8209;step methodology was applied. For all the gestures, six descriptors were used to qualify the environment and the capture situation: (A) the realism of the situation, (B) the length of the gesture, (C) the shooting area size, (D) thought and decision&#8209;making of the operator, (E) the operator’s ability to gaze available information and (F) the operator’s ability to search for information in the environment. A three&#8209;value scale is used for each descriptor to quantify the criticism of the gestures. Results include the perimeter of application of the MAP methodology, describing professional gestures which can be captured, formalized and transmitted. The majority of the descriptors have a moderated influence on the process, concentrating their impact on one point of the method. Two parts of the professional gesture have high&#8209;level impact on the whole process: (1) the visual component of the gesture to use available information or to search pertinent information in the environment, and (2) the time devoted to interaction between operators or to think and make decision during the realization of the professional gesture.

Abstract:
: A main purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of intellectual capital and intellectual capital complementarity on a firm’s global initiatives. Sample was selected with a type of purposive sampling. The selection criteria were that companies had to locate in Taiwan, but competing globally. Altogether 324 firms took part in the study. Structural Equation Modelling technique was used in the data analysis. Based on the analyses results, some implications are provided. Firstly, the importance of intellectual capital is again highlighted. It is confirmed that intellectual capital does enhance a firm’s global initiatives. Secondly, some moderating effects of business environment are found between intellectual capital and global initiatives. Thirdly, the important role of intellectual capital complementarity is identified. It is found that intellectual capital complementarity has positive effect on global initiatives in both high dynamic and low dynamic contexts. As a result, the value of intellectual capital components can mostly be actualized only in terms of their dynamic interrelationships and conjoint interaction.

Abstract:
: Agriculture must evolve into a more environmentally&#8209;friendly approach while remaining economically workable. This type of agriculture is said to be sustainable. It has a systemic logic and therefore requires a strong knowledge base. In this study we propose a knowledge management IT&#8209;based system. In the first part of our article, we discuss the potential actors of the system and their possible implications. The second part deals with the knowledge selection and formalization. The third part describes the main computing features of the knowledge server we propose.

Five grounded Principles for Developing Knowledge Management Systems
Pages:
pp184&#8209;195
Authors:
Mark Woodman
Aboubakr Zade
Abstract:
The practice of developing knowledge management systems in organizations is hindered by a lack of research into (a) what is a knowledge management system, (b) how to develop a knowledge management system in practice, and (c) what role (if any) information technology should play in supporting a knowledge management system. Hence the use of ad hoc, proprietary approaches by practitioners. This paper addresses this gap in research and in practice by presenting five principles from a set of 12 that that emerged through a grounded theory study of the practice of developing knowledge management systems in organizations. The paper focuses on how each of the principles (i) emerged from, and was validated in, evidence collected from developing knowledge management systems, (ii) is connected to related work in the literature, and (iii) informs the practice of developing knowledge management systems. The principles have fundamental implications for the practice and research of developing knowledge management systems in an organizational context. In practice, the principles offer practitioners useful insights into developing knowledge management systems in a way that delivers value to organizations. In research, the principles address several problematic aspects of the literature, particularly concerning divergence, fragmentation and inconsistencies in definitions for knowledge management systems, the purpose for developing knowledge management systems and the role of IT in supporting knowledge management systems. Furthermore, the paper helps distinguish between information systems, which are often used in knowledge management and knowledge management systems whose characteristics, according to the principles presented are very different.

A Qualitative Analysis of Knowledge Transfer in Global Supply Chains: Case of Thai Distributer of Imported Products

Authors:

Abstract:
This paper is the final phase of a larger research project that investigates knowledge transfer in global supply chains from the perspective of South East Asian reseller companies. In a previous study a theoretical model for knowledge transfer in global supply chains was developed and quantitatively validated for the case of Thai resellers of laboratory equipment where equipment resale companies (donors) provide training to their customers (recipients). Results from that previous study indicated that the transfer capability was the most important issue for the donor firms. Furthermore, the most critical factor for the recipient firms was their absorptive capacity in the form of certain capabilities for the successful utilization of the technical knowledge received from the donor firms. By adopting a qualitative sense&#8209;making research approach and a two&#8209;round focus group interview method for data collection and analysis the current study attempts to provide further deeper explanations for the results of previous quantitative survey. Five participants were chosen for two&#8209;round of focus group meetings for this purpose.

Abstract:
IC is alive and well yet still seeking relevanceJohn DumayIntellectual Capital is alive and well across Europe and of course the rest of the world. I feel I obliged to make this opening remark to this special edition (SE) of the EJKM because of my recent experiences, not only at the ECIC 2012 conference, but also my subsequent travel experiences to the other parts of Europe, Asia and Australia I have visited already this year. So far this year I have presented papers on IC at four conferences, five research seminars at different Universities, a practitioner presentation for the Hong Kong Knowledge Management Society and a workshop for an international bank’s KM interest group. Each of these presentations has been well attended and I have had the opportunity to meet and answer questions about IC from students to practitioners and eminent professors. On top of this I am currently visiting at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University where I have met the likes of Stephen Selby who managed the what I would consider to the largest IC project involving SMEs in Asia  if not the world along with Prof. Rongbin Lee and his IC research team which is part of the Knowledge Management Research Centre at Hong Kong Polytechnic . IC is truly alive and well.The international interest in IC is also reflected in the origins and nationalities of the authors and settings of the papers included in this SE. Included here is an eclectic mix of papers from the Caribbean (Carrington and Tayles, 2012), Switzerland (Eggs, 2012), Germany and China (Fritzsche, 2012), Italy and USA (Massaro et al., 2012), Romania (Suciu et al., 2012)and Poland with international overtones (Wiśniewski, 2012) and not to forget an editor who is based in Australia. This is important because IC is not just a local phenomenon because it touches individual organisations right through to nations themselves (see Lin and Edvinsson, 2009). So while the papers have an international flavour they also reflect the growing trend to investigate IC from a practice perspective (Guthrie et al., 2012) with five of the six papers in the SE being base on single or multiple case studies. Investigating IC from this perspective is important because IC has been criticised for being stuck at a metaphorical crossroads of relevance (Chatzkel, 2004) and what is needed are actual examples showing both academics and practioners how IC can be utilised and how it makes a difference.From these five papers two papers focus on the development of “trust” as part of IC (Eggs, 2012; Suciu et al., 2012) a theme which has been central to several previous IC papers (Moeller, 2009; Dumay and Lu, 2010; Reychav and Sharkie, 2010). In the Eggs (2012) paper a case study about how to build trust in a online Community of Practice (CoP) is presented using an IC lens. The paper finds that while technology is an important enabler of IC and CoP attention must be paid to how the technology is deployed and that “needs must drive the technology” rather than technology driving solutions. I think this is important for IC practitioners not only from the technological perspective but from the IC practice perspective because all too often IC practices are seen as “solutions in search of a cause” (Andriessen, 2004, p. 230) rather than being used to resolve problems in organisations using a different lens. The paper is also important because it deals with building trust in an online environment whereby people need to trust the technology as well as the people they interact with through the likes of social media which is these days becoming a ubiquitous form of communication and collaboration. In the second “trust” paper, Suciu et al. (2012) offer a theoretical framework linking “trust, culture, reputation and intellectual capital”. Utilising research performed in the Romanian tertiary education sector using qualitative and quantitative data. As a result of their study they find that “there is an observable cycle in the formation of intellectual capital, where trust, cooperation, reputation, innovation and creativity are the triggers and fuel at the same time”. This is very much in line with my own thinking of how IC is created because of the additive nature of IC and intangible resources (Andriessen, 2006, p. 103) and that socially constructed concepts, such as IC, have duality of structure (see Giddens, 1984), meaning their inputs become their outputs which in then become the new inputs. This allows for people to “become involved, rather than just the accountants, managers and stakeholders who understand the meaning of ... IC” (Dumay, 2008, p. 12). As Suciu et al. (2012) elaborate it then becomes the “job of the company management staff to establish achievable objectives ... and to make sure they follow through” because IC just doesn’t happen on its own, it needs to be enabled by people.Moving from the theme of “trust” to the involvement of “people” is the paper by Fritzsche (2012) who presents a case study based on research at German and Chinese car manufacturers to investigate how people make decisions involving IC between what Fritzsche (2012) identifies as the modes “of potentiality and actuality”. This is an important distinction between how people actually theorise about IC and put IC into practice because often we think about the potential of IC (what are IC’s benefits) and may not later be able to determine what IC has actually done for our organisation. However, Fritzsche (2012) identifies that it is important to make decisions about IC from both perspectives. If we consider the how IC is linked to strategy then it makes sense to involve considerations about the potentiality of IC while later we should then measure the actual impact of IC. The benefit for us as practitioners is that we have a wide variety of IC accounting tools (frameworks) at our disposal (see Sveiby, 2010; and Dumay and Roslender, forthcoming) which “allows an adaptation to the requirements of the given situation” (Fritzsche, 2012). I also believe this is important because as I have discovered in my own research it allows managers to choose the IC tools best suited to resolving managerial problems (Dumay, 2008) and deal with ambiguity (Dumay and Cuganesan, 2011). There isn’t just one right IC tool (framework) for every situation (see Dumay, 2009, for a critique).The fact is IC is a tool that is utilised by many of us in our research and practice and I suspect that nearly every person who is reading this paper for the first time has some understanding of what IC is if not a reasonably in depth knowledge.  Often I believe that when we attend conferences such as ECIC we are preaching to the converted. As a colleague recently wrote in an email that “I find [IC] not being practiced by managers far as much as it’s being preached by us academics…” Thus examining how IC is involved inside particular industries and how we might be able to get the message across to managers who may not have heard of IC is to my mind useful and important. This is the approach taken in the paper by Carrington and Tayles (2012) who present two case studies exploring “the relevance and awareness of IC in two hotel chains in the Caribbean”. The major outcome of their study showed that there was no formal recognition of IC however there were many relevant management practices at the hotels which suggested that IC was present. This is along the same argument of Ordóñez de Pablos (2003, p. 62) who outlined that while today we (us IC academics) call it IC and think it is a new phenomenon for managing in the “knowledge economy” in fact we have been managing IC for some time because management topics such as “human resources, organizational development, change management, information technology, brand and reputation management, performance measurement and valuation” have collided to form IC as a conceptual framework. The Carrington and Tayles (2012) paper is important because it shows that we don’t necessarily need managers to understand what the terms intellectual, human, relational and structural capital are in order to implement practices aimed at improving these areas in the pursuit of better management and value creation.  This is important when we as “preachers” of IC roll out IC to the unconverted masses. Because if we start speaking in these terms under the assumption everyone knows what we are talking about we are likely to meet dumbfounded stares and resistance to our message. Carrington and Tayles (2012) then go on to recommend not increased reporting of IC as is commonly recommended and concluded in many IC studies but rather increased IC education “so as to enlighten them [managers]on the theoretical framework of IC and its attributes” because “managers were engaging in practices related to IC without any knowledge of its relevance and importance in developing a firm’s competitive position.” This is a position I recently discussed with Goran Roos who outlined why thinking about IC was engrained in the psyche of Scandinavian mangers because IC was taught in University courses as an integral part of managing organisational strategy. However many other parts of the word, such as the Caribbean, seem not to have caught up with this mode of thinking and had an IC enlightenment. Thus, instead of preaching to unconverted practitioners, maybe we should concentrate more on converting the educators.The last of the case study papers is by Massaro et al. (2012) who outline how the role of knowledge development though Appreciative Inquiry (see Cooperrider et al., 2005) can be integrated into Management Control Systems (MCS) for managing creative processes and innovation in organisations. They base their new framework on the levers of control model made popular by Simons (1995) in response to the changing dynamics of business in the 1990s. Their model linking MCS to the development of the creativity steps required for innovation is itself innovative and easily understood. This is important for two reasons. First, the model provides managers with a logical way in which to promote the behaviour of an organisation’s human capital towards creativity by recognising that different levers of control are required to promote different types of creative processes. Second, it recognises that the creativity process has different stages and managers need to be able to change their approaches from more formal and structured processes during the early phases of creativity to more open processes which are aligned with implementing ideas. The last paper for the special edition is as much a social commentary on the prior “frantic pace of innovation in the financial services industry” and how this has been “socially disruptive” (Wiśniewski, 2012). What I like about his paper is that is argues how innovations in the financial services industry were rampant and did not have sufficient checks and balances to ensure that  the “finacialisation” of society did not cause negative social effects. Today the world is still reeling from the impact of these failed innovations and many countries at the time I am writing this paper such as Italy, Spain and Greece are yet to realise the full ramifications. Thus a paper which openly talks about the impact of failed innovation is appropriate for this SE just as was Karl&#8209;Erik Sveiby’s keynote speech at ECIC 2012 called Challenging the Innovation Paradigm where he also questioned the so called “unquestionable” benefits of innovation whereby a pro&#8209;innovation bias always claims that innovation is a good thing (see also Sveiby et al., 2012). Reading the Wiśniewski (2012) paper confirms that this is not the case and that rampant unchecked financial innovations which fail can have deep and lasting impact on society just as failed innovations can have a detrimental effect on organisations.In line with my previous comments on the espoused benefits of IC as lauded by the “preachers” we should also be cognisant of taking a more critical stance (see Guthrie et al., 2012) and begin to question the benefits of IC by building on what is good and by recognising that there may also exist “intellectual liabilities” alongside our “intellectual assets”. Maybe a more appropriate term should be “intellectual equity” whereby we take a balanced view of the social, utility and economic value created by managing IC rather than just blindly preach only its benefits. Doing so could help overcome some of the relevance lost by our current implementation of IC practices so that one day IC will become a useful and integrated part of the way that organisations and thus society is developed and improved.

Cindy Eggs
Abstract:
The Research Management Unit of Swiss Distance University for Applied Sciences (Fernfachhochschule Schweiz  FFHS) has experienced trust building processes in virtual environment amongst others in their work with Community of Practice (CoP). The establishment of CoPs has become their core business, that means that they have have planned and implemented such kind of learning communities for international companies and for university groups. According to the author, CoPs are perceived as laboratory for creating intellectual capital for which trust building is a pre&#8209;conditioned success factor. To identify trust building methods in a research environment in particular and in CoPs in general, using new technologies is the main aim in this paper. So, the broad subject CoP and intellectual capital will be constricted and the focus put on trust. A special focus is put on the virtuality element which has become very important with the raise of social media platforms in the business world. Following questions will be addressed in the paper: How is trust defined in a virtual environment, especially among researchers? How can you build trust in a CoP? How can the community leader influence this trust building? What is the role of different group members? Which influence does a deep organizational trust have on the success of a community?  To answer this question, foremost a theoretical analyses model for trust and its processes will be developed based on the three domains of intellectual capital which most authors have identified for the division of intellectual capital: human capital, structural capital and relationship capital. To cope with the technical dimension of virtuality, a new approach to the intellectual capital domains is elaborated. In the first place, at the level of human capital, the author describes personal characteristics and competencies (knowledge management skills) which enable trust building. Secondly, the level of structural capital focuses on technical aspect of the community and activities which foster trust building. Last but not least, the relationship level studies the trust building process linked to different roles and a new collaborative culture. As a case study for this paper, serves the community of researchers at the FFHS which collaborate through a virtual platform called eDolphin. The researchers, working for a future&#8209;oriented institution and eUniversity, come from different disciplines and promote an eLearning and eCollaboration approach in team activities and project management. The findings of the theoretical approach lead to its adaptation to the practical example of eDolphin. How was trust build in this case? What are the lessons learned which we identified during this community building process.  Last but not least, some theories and findings concerning community building on social media platforms are described.

Abstract:
The contemporary approach to the concept of intellectual capital has transformed. The three components (human, relational and organizational capital) are not enough to reflect reality, as the static perspective was replaced by an integrative vision: intangible resources, actions and process that contribute to sustainable competitive advantage. However, this theoretical division provides solid ground for explaining the close bond between trust, cultural identity and cooperation, soft concepts, and intellectual capital in knowledge&#8209;based organizations. Therefore, we consider it is of high interest to identify the nature of the relational and organizational capital, and trust association. Is it first trust and then the two intellectual capital components, or the other way around? Also, we can take one step further and consider the intellectual capital formation process and architectural scheme behind it. This paper aims firstly at offering a theoretical framework for the liaisons between the concepts previously mentioned and intellectual capital, underlying specific characteristics for the Romanian educational system, especially for tertiary /higher education. The second objective is to provide new research directions, comparing the findings with situations of other cultures, like Japan and USA. The research methodology comprises a thorough literature review of scientific studies and of the 2011 National Romanian Education Law. It focuses on the changes and challenges for the intellectual capital formation phase. Also, it involves an empirical investigation of an evaluation of the current intellectual capital formation route. The research instrument is a questionnaire, collecting information for both quantitative and qualitative research purposes. The findings of this paper seek to identify the structure and dynamics of the intellectual capital formation process in the Romanian higher education system. As well, we hope to lead to concrete solutions for improving general dynamics, and acknowledgment of trust, cooperation and cultural aspects as corner stones in education intellectual capital formation area.

Title:
Implicit Evaluations of Intellectual Capital in Practical Decision Making

Authors:
Albrecht Fritzsche
Abstract:
A lot of the confusion about the measurability of intellectual capital can be explained by a neglect of the difference between an object, the capital it provides, and the profit from the application of this capital. An analysis of this difference leads to the distinction between the potential of intellectual capital for economic process and its actual realization. Case studies from different areas of managerial practice show that decision making about intellectual capital considers it both in the mode of potentiality and actuality. However, the level to which the difference of modality is made explicit varies a lot. Talent management and network planning tend to minimize reflections about potentiality. This is possible because these reflections are an implicit part of the preceding activities in the company that provide the basis for the decision situation. In intellectual property management, decision makers have more freedom to consider the further potential of the capital in question. In the application of different methods to evaluate intellectual capital, it therefore seems important to look for a strong consistency between the way how actuality and potentiality are taken into consideration by the structure of the business practice and the approach of the method.

Intellectual Capital in the Caribbean Hospitality Industry: Two Case Studies

Abstract:
This paper explores the relevance and awareness of IC in two hotel chains in the Caribbean. A qualitative exploratory case study method was used to gain an in&#8209;depth understanding of the constructs relating to IC within indigenous Caribbean hotels. The data collection procedures employed were documentation, archival records and twenty interviews with top managers. Content analysis was used as the major technique for analyzing the data. The major finding is that there is no formal recognition of the construct of IC, but the embedded practices within the organisations suggested the presence of such.  The data clustering and analysis of the evidence suggested two themes for HC &#8209;personal competencies and human resource praxes; three themes for RC &#8209; customer capital, brand and community capital; and three themes for SC &#8209; information systems, innovation and organization.  The case studies further revealed that the chains had embedded human resource practices and well established customer relationship management systems which created linkages among the components of IC.

Supporting creativity through knowledge integration during the creative processes. A management control system perspective

Abstract:
Organizations require an intensive knowledge integration mechanism that supports creativity within all the phases of its process in order to analyze, understand, select, and integrate ideas into a business model. Management Control Systems, as a part of the structural capital, can be utilized as knowledge integration mechanisms to provide: i) a dialog among internal or external actors of the creative process; ii) a knowledge repository for data and other information required in the selecting process; iii) representation of the new ideas into a business model. Using a multi&#8209;method case study, this article analyzes the role of knowledge integration played by Management Control Systems (MCS). Within the perspective of the Levers of Control (Simons, 1995), MCS are recognized as the sum of belief, boundary, diagnostic and interactive systems that could be used to manage the creative process. We apply the Appreciative Inquiry model of creativity (Cooperrider, Srivastva, 1987) which recognizes four steps: Discovery, Dream, Design, and Destiny. Creativity is then classified based on the problem's characteristic using Unsworth's model (2001) which separates closed and open problems. Results show that in the early phases of the creativity process problems are more structured  and are faced using diagnostic and boundary tools. In the design phase, a dynamic tension between interactive and diagnostic systems is always preferred. The final phase (Destiny) requires diagnostic approaches in all cases. On this foundation, the paper aims to contribute to the literature on innovation and intangible assets. It is our opinion that the results could also be used by managers and entrepreneurs involved in the creative process in order to improve a companies ability to face change.

Abstract:
Financial companies worldwide are blamed for having precipitated the gravest global economic meltdown since the Great Depression of the 1930s. While the aftershocks of the last turmoil are still palpable and some observers prophesy that another sharp economic downturn might be in the offing  global policymakers, analysts, researchers and the public at large ruminate how to redress the balance of powers to ensure socially sustainable financial and macroeconomic growth. This paper reviews the expansion of worldwide financial industries relative to real economies (financialisation), exemplifies its social ramifications and indentifies the root causes of socially disruptive innovation undertaken in financial institutions. Finally, the paper highlights the prerequisites of social equilibria in financial organisations, of which most are endogenous in nature.

Global Social Knowledge Management: From Barriers to the Selection of Social Tools

Abstract:
Web 2.0 and Social Software revolutionize the knowledge exchange within and between organizations. This is one of the claims consultants and software vendors in the field have made. But have the promises been kept and has evidence been achieved so far, in particular for knowledge management in globally distributed settings? As a starting point, our paper introduces the field of Global Social Knowledge Management (GSKM). We see this area as one of the main research area for future research in the Knowledge Management domain. A variety of social software applications have already been seen promising and incorporated into the context of knowledge management (Avram 2006; Zheng and Zheng 2010; Levy 2009). One main assumption is that social software could bridge the traditional gap between human&#8209; and technology orientation (Avram 2006:1; Fiedler & Welpe 2011). However, there is so far only anecdotal evidence how these applications work in globally distributed organizational settings. Within this paper, we present the key issues for GSKM and elaborate on transferability of these aspects to differing contexts. The main research domains related to GSKM are Social Software and Global Knowledge Management. We present a brief review of state of the art research for these domains and focus in detail on Social Software supported knowledge activities. As one of the first efforts, we perform a mapping of Social Software to KM activities and major barriers. Additionally, we will illustrate through a case study how to contextualize the GSKM approach for educational application area. The paper is a starting point for discourse on this promising field, outlining the research field of globally distributed Social Software&#8209;supported Knowledge Management and discussing current research efforts on the main components. By this paper we intend to contribute towards a research agenda for Global Social Knowledge Management.

Knowledge Dynamics Analysis in Negotiations

Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to present some research results we obtained in analysing knowledge dynamics during negotiation processes. For knowledge dynamics we use the semantic spectrum currently used in thermodynamics, through a metaphorical interface. In our view knowledge dynamics means complex transformations from one form of knowledge into another form of knowledge. In our research we considered the dyad containing cognitive knowledge and emotional knowledge, in the Nonaka’s oneness perspective. Cognitive knowledge is represented by the explicit or the rational knowledge. Emotional knowledge is represented by the result of processing our sensory information and integrating it into the non&#8209;rational mind. Similar to energy, knowledge can be found in organizations and society in different forms: explicit knowledge, implicit knowledge, tacit knowledge, emotional knowledge, spiritual knowledge, symbolic knowledge. Our hypothesis is that one form of knowledge can be transformed into another form in a given Ba. Our research focused on iterative transformations of cognitive knowledge into emotional knowledge and of emotional knowledge into cognitive knowledge during negotiation processes. We designed and performed 28 experiments of simulated negotiations between an experienced negotiator and different individuals without any training in negotiations. The duration of each experiment was about 20 minutes. We videotaped all of these experiments obtaining about 9 hours of recorded negotiations. There were basically two types of negotiations: a) a typical trade negotiation, and b) a typical salary negotiation. Based on a well designed script, the experienced negotiator sent different cognitive and emotional messages to the would be employee, who has been asked to answer using both written and verbal answers. In the same time we recorded his expressions that reflected the emotional answer. By analysing the induced messages and the cognitive and emotional answers for each participant we got interesting results concerning the knowledge dynamics in the negotiation processes.

Can Family Firms Innovate? Sharing Internal Knowledge From a Social Capital Perspective
Pages:
pp30&#8209;37
Authors:
Antonio Carrasco-Hernández
Daniel Jiménez-Jiménez
Abstract:
Many studies focus their analysis on the effects of knowledge management on the development of organizational innovations. Innovation is posited, in this paper, to be a managerial priority that facilitates the creation of competitive advantage. The data, information and knowledge that contribute to innovation processes are available in social capital. Social capital is understood as the networks, norms and trust that enable participants to act together more effectively to pursue shared objectives (Putnam, 1993). From this foundation, we argue that the effectiveness of these networks can be determined by whether the personnel who interact perceive the relationship to be worthwhile, equitable, productive and satisfying. Only individuals can apply their own experience and contextual understanding to interpret the details and implications of a particular situation in order to determine what is the appropriate action or actions to take. Internal social capital enhances the ability of members within a firm to know who to contact for relevant knowledge. This means that internal social capital facilitates the development of innovation through the acquisition of knowledge from internal and external networks. However, there are some problems in family firms. The utilization of internal capital does not guarantee that appropriate information is used in appropriate circumstances or that information is appropriately updated (De Holan and Phillips, 2004). The influence of the family on the company may inhibit or foster the exploitation of this knowledge. In this context, we try to test the influence of social capital on innovation on family firms.  We develop a measure of the extent of family control of family companies – familiness – and examine the moderator role of this variable in the relationship between social capital and product innovation. The results of our empirical study of 282 family firms show that social capital has a positive relationship with product innovation. That is, the active connections among people – “the trust, mutual understanding, shared values and behaviors that bind the members of human networks and communities and make cooperative action possible” (Cohen and Prusak, 2001) – allow companies to generate innovations. Second, we also found that familiness plays a moderator role in the relationship between social capital and innovation. In this case, we have found that cultural dimension of familiness positively moderates the relationship between social capital and innovation.

Abstract:
Knowledge resides within a human being and it is hard to be transferred to others. Unwillingness to share is one of the main impediments of knowledge sharing. In a university setting, this situation could be more alarming as universities are knowledge centric organisation. Knowledge sharing will help universities to strengthen its research and teaching activities. Despite the importance of knowledge sharing, many academics still hoard their knowledge. The aims for this paper are (1) to evaluate the influence of these two emotional factors towards knowledge sharing intention; (2) to examine whether the perception of knowledge sharing in public universities differs from private universities. The research model includes the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the two affective components. In order to examine the research model, a survey was conducted with a total respondent of 545 academics from 30 universities in Malaysia. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the research model. On the other hand, t&#8209;test was used to examine the differences between public and private universities. In general, the findings revealed that emotional influence is crucial for knowledge sharing behaviour. The t&#8209;test analysis shows that there are significant differences between public and private universities. This paper contributes to the existing literature by evaluating the impact of emotional factors (affective commitment and affective trust) towards knowledge sharing behaviour. It also provides a greater depth of understanding on how knowledge sharing in public universities deviate from private universities. University administrators need to implement policies and activities to strengthen the emotional bonding between academics in order to facilitate knowledge sharing in Malaysian universities. This is exceptionally crucial for private universities as the results shows that knowledge sharing intention is lower than the public universities.

Learning Process and Using IT in the Naval Industry

Abstract:
This paper analyses the nature of the impact of learning on the adoption of information technologies (IT) and vice versa in the naval sector. It is necessary for a shipyard to acquire new knowledge, distribute it, interpret it, and store it enabling the use of Information Technologies by internal and external agents. For this reason, a model must be found in order to examine the impact of IT on the codification of knowledge considering external agents (customers, suppliers and retired personnel) and internal agents (engineers, workers and managers) in the shipyard. The authors investigate the implementation of IT through a learning process in the naval industry through a case study. The authors collected data through interviews and presented a model depicting linkages between agents of a shipyard organization (customer, suppliers, engineers, workers, directors), knowledge&#8209;related processes (codification, storage, reutilization) and benefits. Following discussion of the model, authors conclude that acquiring external knowledge is beneficial and facilitating interactions between agents increases the benefits for the shipyard organization. In the study it is possible to appreciate that acquiring and distributing knowledge from external agents is a previous step to the codification of this knowledge using Technological tools. Only considering this sequence, it is guaranteed a knowledge update by internal agents in the shipyard. During the last few years the naval industry has been modernized in defence matters and a lot of money has been spent in IT. That is why it is necessary to assess the use of IT and learning in this sector as well as to analyse the knowledge learning process and systematisation used in the naval industry during the different phases required for construction. Finally, the results have implications for managers of the shipyard when they make a choice as to the organizational capabilities to target in order to ensure the effective adoption of IT.

Authors:
Jamie O’Brien
Abstract:
The primary aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a robust Knowledge Assessment Framework (KAF). The development of a KAF is important for organisations for three reasons. Firstly, the use of knowledge assessment allows firms to pinpoint knowledge gaps. Secondly, it allows firms to manage knowledge more effectively. Thirdly, it gives organisations a diagnostic tool with which to gauge their knowledge base. The effective management of knowledge can be considered a competency that enables a greater level of service to be extracted from other resources within the organisation. The results of this study highlight several points for organisations interested in understanding their knowledge base. The analysis moved beyond simply looking at the framework itself and offers some interesting insights.

Abstract:
This is my first editorial, as I have just recently become the editor of the Electronic Journal of Knowledge Management, following a long period as a paper reviewer. I feel very honoured to be able to contribute to the continued success of our journal at a challenging time for the KM discipline.  While the field has evolved significantly since its emergence in the early 1990s and attracted a high level of interest across both the academic and the practitioner communities, any comprehensive review of recent publications across the discipline might produce some sense of déjà vu, as many are concerned that limited progress is being made in the broader recognition of the discipline in the academic community and in the adoption of good KM practices.

Governing Frameworks for Sharing Actionable Knowledge
Pages:
pp127&#8209;138
Authors:
David Johnson
Abstract:
A fundamental necessity for the transfer of actionable knowledge is that it must occur within a context. This essay suggests that governing frameworks provide the medium within which it becomes possible to share actionable knowledge. To support this claim the notion of governing frames is first explicated. Frameworks provide the basic support structures for sharing knowledge within organizations through the development of an inextricable linkage between context and meaning often found in the underlying foundation for governance structures. Each of the classic governing frameworks discussed, formal, informal, markets, and professional, has different manifestations of key structural elements, relationships, elements, context, configurations, and temporal stability and thus different implications for sharing knowledge.   The strengths and weakness of the various frameworks for understanding the sharing of knowledge in organizations are exemplified by focusing on two exemplar problems:  information seeking and clinical and translational science. In conclusion, the concept of governing frameworks offers a new way of looking at the often intractable problem of sharing knowledge in our ever more complex organizations. A compelling focus of future research is how these frameworks are negotiated in an increasingly professionalized world where specialists must integrate their activities in interprofessional teams.

Abstract:
Abstract: The aim of the present is to verify the degree of applicability of the financial valuation method developed by Rodríguez&#8209;Castellanos et al. (2006a, 2007) for the valuation of real option&#8209;based intangibles in the Spanish region of the Basque Country. The field study consisted on a telephone survey of CFOs in a random sample of Basque Country’s firms, selected using segmentation criteria based on size and business sector. Considering the 517 replies received it is stated that, despite three of every four CFOs answering that options were included in their intangibles, approximately one of every five is actually capable of identifying such options. When we consider the difficulties encountered in estimating the model’s parameters, the conclusion is that less than 10% of the region’s firms are likely to be in a position to directly apply the method proposed for the valuation of real option&#8209;based intangibles, which means a preliminary phase of analysis and diagnosis is required before the method can actually be applied in practice. The present paper makes a substantial contribution because it’s the first study that tries to verify the utility of a method for the financial valuation of intangible resources to take into account the associated real options. It could be useful from an academic and managerial point of view.

Measuring Innovation in Agricultural Firms: A Methodological Approach
Pages:

Authors:

Abstract:
Abstract: Measuring innovation is a notoriously difficult task. Agricultural firms present additional complications due to the complexities and uncertainties linked to the sector. Among the increasing literature available on innovation, there is plenty of information about innovation measurement in manufacturing industries, but scarce contributions for the case of agricultural  firms. Currently there is no concerted and/or published methodology for innovations measurement for such firms. This research proposes a methodology for measuring innovation and its key determinants in agricultural firms, based on three main tools. The first one is the Innovation Matrix (IM), an approach to a structured catalogue of the technology in the agricultural subsector under study. IM includes information about innovation technological level, in terms of its place on the technological spectrum of the subsector. IM also includes information about the frequency of innovation, which refers to the degree of adoption of a particular innovation among the farmers. The second tool is the Innovation Index (II), a single number that combines information about the technological level and frequency of the observed innovations. The basic idea of II is to assign higher values to firms that implement either less frequent or comparatively advanced innovations, relative to the ones implemented by its competitors. Since II is always a real non&#8209;negative number, it is possible to use OLS estimation procedures  (third tool) to enquire about the factors driving innovation processes in agricultural firms. We have applied this methodology to four agricultural subsectors in Colombia. The II results reveal relatively small values for most of the surveyed producers. At the same time, they provide evidence to support the claim that there are just a few innovative leaders in every chain. In general, the factors determining innovation are subsector&#8209;specific, but there are still some general stylized facts for the whole agricultural sector. The main consequence of this finding is that innovation policy design for the agricultural sector must take into account the existence of both sectorial (common) and subsector (specific) factors.

Abstract:
Abstract: In 2001 Kent State University established a graduate level program that granted a Master of Science degree in Information Architecture and Knowledge Management. The Knowledge Management concentration was a cornerstone of that degree program. The Knowledge Management concentration has sustained and thrived over the past ten years, though the path has not always been easy or clear. This case study describes the challenges encountered and the solutions developed over the past ten years. The case study discusses nineteen challenges and their solutions, in hopes that other institutions may benefit from Kent State University’s lessons learned and successes. The case study highlights issues that arise as an academic program matures, including: curriculum development and design, administrative support and alignment, faculty credentials and credibility, and research support.

Unfolding the Gordian Knot of the University Intellectual Capital

Abstract:
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the Gordian Knot of the intellectual capital of the universities is the structural capital, and that unfolding it requires a deep understanding of the nature of structural capital This idea comes from a new perspective on the intellectual capital structure and on the relative importance of each component of it, i.e. human capital, structural capital and relational capital. Many authors consider that the human capital is the most important and by far the dominant component of the intellectual capital of the universities. Our research based on the new concept of organizational intellectual capital integrators showed that a university may have a great potential of the intellectual capital based on the human capital component, and yet not to perform competitively due to the weak integrators and stiff structural capital. In our view, an integrator is a powerful field of forces capable of combining two or more elements into a new entity, based on interdependence and synergy. These elements may have a physical or virtual nature, and they must posses the capacity of interacting in a controlled way. For any university these integrators have an intngible nature. The interdependence property is necessary for combining all elements into a system. The synergy property makes it possible to generate an extra energy or power from the working system. It makes the difference between a linear system and a nonlinear one. The Gordian Knot of the intellectual capital of universities is the structural capital. Only understanding the nature and the complexity of the structural capital we will be able to understand the full potential of the intellectual capital metaphor. Thus, the structural capital is the key component of the university intellectual capital and it is strongly related to the concepts of university governance and university autonomy. This paper is based on a conceptual research, a search of the literature, and on a solid experience one of the authors has got in the legislation and management of the university system of Romania, as a former General Director for Higher Education in the Ministry of Education and Research.

The Value of Human Resources Measurement in Intellectual Capital and Knowledge sharing

Abstract:
Abstract: It is recognised and accepted by business leaders and academic scholars alike that people (human resources) are an organisation’s most critical assets in the contemporary knowledge economy. While this may be true, this rhetoric is often not matched by the reality of employment practices related to this important yet ambiguous resource.  The purpose of this paper is to review the current situation with respect to the question of people as valuable resources in the intellectual capital and knowledge management paradigms. Our contention is that human resources pivotal  to the success of modern business enterprises, irrespective of their sizes. This paper’s empirical basis is achieved by presenting research data made by the authors on the relationship between psychosocial variables and human resource practices on behaviours associated with intellectual capital and knowledge sharing. A positive relationship has been found between attitudes, subjective norms, and self&#8209;efficacy on knowledge sharing behaviour. Besides this, a positive correlation was found between the concept of psychological capital and knowledge sharing. With respect to human resource practices, the paper includes a review of research undertaken on management’s perception on the importance of measuring human resources, some organisations’ attempts to achieve this, and the current barriers towards the measurement of value. Current research on the relationship of knowledge sharing and human resource practices is presented. The paper concludes with a discussion on the authors’ observations of the value of human resources in the current state of the theoretical and practical considerations of intellectual capital and knowledge sharing, and their suggestions on a way forward in this developing area of ICKM.

Tacit Knowledge, its Codification and Technological Advancement

Abstract:
Abstract: The paper addresses issues related to the confusion surrounding conceptual understanding of tacit knowledge and its transferability in organization's realm from an original perspective. Lately, at every level: country, industry and organization, attention to knowledge has intensified due to the realization that in "post&#8209;capitalist society" (Drucker, 1993) knowledge is increasingly replacing traditional driving forces of economy: labor, capital and natural resources as the primary factor in economic growth.  Knowledge use is now considered as imperative in all aspects of an organization. In literature there exist various typologies of knowledge, however, in organizational science most common classifications of knowledge include two general types: tacit and explicit. This paper brings clarity to the concept of tacit knowledge, nexus between tacit and explicit knowledge and effects of advances in technologies on the codification capability of tacit knowledge. It argues that many types of tacit knowledge that were considered as inexplicable just recently thanks to new technologies have become transferable. Drawing examples from knowledge science literature the author questions the rigid belief of some scholars in ineffability of tacit knowledge. The author also claims that organizations need to reassess their knowledge related strategy, particularly, in relation to tacit knowledge if they would like to develop sustainable competitive advantage from effective knowledge use. Findings: The author shows how new technologies are changing our perception of tacit knowledge and why it is time for organizations to reevaluate their knowledge strategy. Originality/Value:  By showing a clear correlation between technological advancement and tacit knowledge transformability the paper contributes to the theoretical understanding of tacit knowledge.

Trust as Intangible Asset &#8209; Enabling Intellectual Capital Development by Leadership for Vitality and Innovativeness

Authors:
Taina Savolainen
Palmira Lopez-Fresno
Abstract:
Abstract: Trust has become an essential intangible asset in organizations and leadership. Trust promotes social order and cooperation in workplace relationships. It is a resource that creates vitality and enables innovativeness. The paper discusses and examines the highly timely topic of trust from the human intellectual capital (HIC) perspective. More specifically, the focus is on the role trust plays in renewing intellectual capital by leadership. In the paper, trust is viewed in a relational context describing the positive expectations of a respectful human behaviour. Originality of the paper is based on the two ideas of both theoretical and practical significance. First, exploring and conceptualizing trust as intangible asset, resource and skill in organizations. Second, examining how trust in leadership enables HIC development and how it affects. The paper provides a novel view into managing intangibles, since trust as intellectual resource and a leadership skill in relation to HIC development have hardly been examined integrated. The main point highlights the importance of leadership by trust in enabling the growth and utilization of HIC. The paper advocates the idea that, in managing knowledge, it is important to increase understanding of the interaction among different aspects of KM. The value intangible assets, such as trust, add to human resource development (HRD) is multiple and still poorly understood. The paper presents also two real life case studies of how leadership by trust enables vitality and innovativeness in organizations. The case studies examine the sharing of tacit knowledge and co&#8209;creation with customers.

How to Innovate Management Through Intellectual Capital Statements &#8209; Lessons Learned From the First Implementations in Brazil

Abstract:
Abstract: Recent initiatives have shown that it is time to think about new ways of managing companies, particularly in emerging economies. Mertins et al (2012), points out that, “In the rapidly emerging Brazilian economy, intangible assets become a key success factor for sustainable growth”. As experiences in the fast moving city and state of Rio de Janeiro have shown, the development of systematic management procedures for these intangible assets is especially valuable for fast growing small and medium&#8209;sized enterprises (SMEs) in order to serve as a solid backbone for an increasingly knowledge&#8209;based economy.  Another initiative described by Sequeira et al (2012) highlights that Brazil has been evolving into a knowledge society dealing with political changes, globalization, new technologies, and new global competitors, such as China. The need to enhance companies´ and, by extension, countries´ competitiveness has grown rapidly. It is, therefore, evident that organisations and particularly government policies need to redress some critical competitiveness issues, most notably the establishment of the Competitive Intelligence System as a strategic tool. Without such tool, organisations and the country will find it difficult to position themselves within the global marketplace. Taking into account the main conclusions of the two initiatives described above, and the unique circumstances of organically grown organizations in the Brazilian business environment, this paper discusses the challenge of integrating the Intellectual Capital Statement &#8209; ICS into a comprehensive strategic change process. In order to promote sustainable business development in an emerging economy, the ICS has to be used to establish a continuous improvement cycle in the individual company, focusing on practical actions for maintaining and developing its intangible assets to ensure future competition capability.

Abstract:
Abstract: Knowledge transfer is a real challenge for organizations and particularly for those who have based their strategy on knowledge codification using knowledge engineering methods. These organizations are facing one major problem: their knowledge repository is used by few persons. Why? In this article, we identify barriers for transfer and appropriation of codified knowledge referential. We show that codified knowledge transfer should be a specific collaborative process taking into account three aspects: complexity and specificity of codified knowledge, readers’ profiles, and exchange channels. Then, we propose to improve knowledge transfer process by developing new specifications for the codified knowledge to increase its transferability and by elaborating a pertinent shared context for knowledge interpretation. It is an empirical methodology which optimizes continuity between knowledge codification and knowledge transfer.

Title:
An Empirical Study on the Impact of the Process of Measuring IC on Performance

Abstract:
Abstract: This paper explores the relevance and importance of measurement of IC and its impact on performance in the Caribbean hospitality industry.  A survey using a 7&#8209;point Likert scale was administered to hotel managers to test the relationship between measurement of IC and performance controlling for hotel size and rating of the hotel. The data analysis techniques used were exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and hierarchical multiple regression. The analysis of hierarchical multiple regressions allowed us to support the hypothesis that measurement of IC explained a significant additional proportion of variance in performance above and beyond that of number of hotel rooms and hotel ranking.  This finding of a significant and positive relationship between measurement of IC and performance has relevance to both IC academics and practitioners, as it validates the use of measurement of IC to enhance performance. This paper adds to the extant literature on IC within the Caribbean and the hospitality industry both under&#8209;research areas in terms of IC.

Pedro Figueroa Dorrego et al
Abstract:
Abstract: At a time when intellectual capital and product innovation management are both considered to be critical for companies to gain a competitive edge (and even survive) in todays unstable business environment, this paper discusses the influence of relational capital on product innovation performance at innovative small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Building upon the intellectual capital and new product development perspectives, an empirical research was conducted, using a questionnaire administered to a network of Portuguese innovative SMEs. The findings suggest that relational capital does have a positive effect on product innovation performance. In particular, Vertical relationships emerges as the main relational capital element significantly affecting product innovation at the innovative SMEs level. The existence and proactive management of relationships with customers and suppliers emerge as critical factors to product innovation success. We find our results to be useful for both researchers and practitioners: we contribute to the ongoing understanding of relational capitals impact on critical business phenomena, while also identifying additional critical factors for new product development success.

Strategically Developing Intellectual Capital Effectiveness: A Conceptual Model for Innovative Companies

Authors:
Harold Harlow
Abstract:
Abstract: Developing intellectual capital at companies often results in large numbers of patents filed with little results other than protection of firm historical patents against intellectual property intrusion by current competitors or future competitors. This paper presents exploratory  research to classify into those patents filed in past years by several major technology companies as well as measuring the business results of the patents which shows the need for the new strategic conceptual model presented in this paper. A new approach to align corporate resources toward patent  strategies, management capability and process with strategic intent is presented which enables firms to assure that all needed considerations are present in a comprehensive technology and patent strategy of intellectual capital  development, especially at technology firms.

Voluntary Disclosure of Intellectual Assets and Intellectual Liabilities: Impact on Financial Performance in Publicly Listed Firms in the United Arab Emirates

Authors:

Abstract:
Abstract: Financial reporting is an important, crucial task for achieving and sustaining a well&#8209;organized, farsighted business. Furthermore, investor demand for relevant information and improved quality and timeliness of financial information is increasing in the face of deteriorating usefulness of traditionally reported earnings, cash flows, and equity values. Thus, many accounting industry practitioners, analysts, and researchers now see Intellectual Capital (IC) as a driver for a firms long term business competitiveness. However, most IC studies have overlooked the negative side of IC which is referred to as Intellectual Liabilities (IL). Therefore, the objective of the present research is to explore through empirical analysis how Intellectual Assets (IA) and IL components, as independent variables, influence Firm Financial Performance (FFP) as a dependent variable. The present study uses content analysis of 2010 and 2011 annual reports for all publicly listed companies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Multivariate regression analysis is employed to answer the research question: What are the characteristics of a new conceptual model that assists in explaining the relationships between IC disclosure and FFP for companies listed on the UAE stock exchanges? The findings indicate a statistically positive relationship between Human Assets (HA), Relational Assets (RA), Structural Assets (SA), Human Liabilities (HL), Relational Liabilities (RL), and Structural Liabilities (RL) on one hand, and Return on Equity (ROE) on the other hand. However, this research has some limitations which include the restrictions inherent in the content analysis method, in addition to the external validity to other jurisdictions due to the sample being chosen from the UAE only. In terms of practical implications, the findings of this study provide an insight to firm managers on the impact of increased transparency and disclosure on FFP.

A Theoretical Model for the Report of Intellectual Capital

Florinda Matos
Abstract:
Abstract: Intellectual capital has become a key element of the knowledge economy. Their management is a factor that influences the competitive advantage of companies. The main objective of this paper is to present a methodology (ICM &#8209; Intellectual Capital Model) that allows the audit of intellectual capital management in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). From the conducted research, it can be concluded that the model is technically robust and determines that the management of intellectual capital is likely to be audited and certified in order to control the quality and dynamism of the knowledge generated and allowing the partner organizations (customers, suppliers and enders) to estimate the innovation capacity and verify the conformity of their management parameters, compared with a reference standard. Indeed, the results of surveys also show that the proposed model forms the basis of a credible accreditation system for intellectual capital management in the majority of Portuguese SMEs. This paper also contributes to enhance the discussion around the value of organizations intangible assets and therefore to change the current concepts of economic development.

Intellectual Capital and Innovation: A Case Study of a Public Healthcare organisation in Europe

Helena Santos-Rodrigues
Abstract:
Abstract: This research study focuses on innovation and the Human, Structural, and Relational components of Intellectual Capital, using Santos&#8209;Rodrigues et al. (2011) research proposal as a framework.  It aims to investigate the influence of Intellectual Capital on a public Healthcare organisations capability for innovation. Sixty five of the sixty eight questionnaires administered to hospital managers and leaders between July and August of 2011, were used in the research. The study suggests that a relationship exists between the incentives to innovate (a dimension of Human Capital) and the innovation created, with trust being the only Structural Capital dimension related with the innovation adopted.  It was found that networks and alliances (a dimension of Relational Capital), is the only dimension simultaneously related with the innovation created and adopted constructs, hence, Relational Capital being the only Intellectual Capital construct related simultaneously with both innovation creation and adoption. The research further suggests that there is a direct relation between Human Capital and innovation, principally with the innovation created. The Structural Capital construct was found to be partly related with the Innovation Adoption construct.

ICBS Intellectual Capital Benchmarking System: A Practical Methodology for Successful Strategy Formulation in the Knowledge Economy
Pages:
pp373&#8209;386
Authors:
José Viedma Marti
Abstract:
Abstract: The advent of the knowledge economy fundamentally changes the way to create wealth. According to new theoretical foundations (Resource Based View, Dynamic Capabilities and Knowledge Based View) key strategic knowledge or Intellectual Capital has become the fundamental driver of wealth creation. A revision of the literature concludes that business excellence has always been due to good strategy formulation and superior strategy implementation. In order to achieve business excellence in the knowledge economy context substantial efforts have been made to improve the process of strategy implementation and some of them have produced relevant frameworks and methodologies, such as Balanced Scorecard and InCaS (Intellectual Capital Statement. Made in Europe). Nevertheless, fewer efforts have been made in the process of strategy formulation and, in practice, the SWOT analysis still is the most well known existing framework. However, in a world where customer preferences are volatile and the identity of customers and the technologies for serving them are changing, a market&#8209;focused strategy may not provide the stability and constancy of direction needed as a foundation for long term strategy. When the external environment is in a state of flux, the firm itself, in terms of its bundle of resources and capabilities, may be a much more stable basis on which to define its identity. Hence, a definition of the firm in terms of what it is capable of doing may offer a more durable basis for strategy than a definition based upon the needs the business seeks to satisfy. Consequently, the SWOT analysis methodology can⠒t cope with the new external environment requirements and a kind of improved or extended SWOT analysis is needed. ICBS (Intellectual Capital Benchmarking System) is the output of a practical research on extended or improved SWOT analysis, a framework that knowledge economy requires for successful strategy formulation. ICBS is a new management method that allows companies to perform a competitiveness strategy check&#8209;up of their business models. F

Abstract:
Abstract: If a company aims to succeed at developing its competitive advantage, knowledge assets should be considered as an important resource as it is the raw material from which financial results are obtained. This Case Study aims to determine whether human Capital is presented and valuated in a small company working in the logistics sector, and if it has an impact on the financial performance. Considering this, we have developed a Case Study that utilises a pragmatic and unique, holistic and exploratory approach. Data collection was carried out mainly through interviews and observation centred on Human Capital and on the financial performance, conducted on two elements from different levels of authority and responsibility within the company, a director and an operation employee. A Likert scale of 5 points was used, and the study concluded that both participants interviewed, shared a similar point of view about Human Capital and the financial performance. It was also concluded that the company evaluated is human Capital, in particular, the follow elements: the employees formation and training, skills, teamwork, internal relations and knowledge share had impact in the financial performance of a firm, and the company had a positive result over the years, although yields have stagnated recently, and expenses have increased due to the current international crisis. Consequently, it was concluded that in those companies, Human Capital was valuated and the case study suggests that there is a relationship with financial performance.

Cross&#8209;cultural Validation of UTAUT: The Case of University VLEs in Jordan, Russia and the UK
Pages:
pp25&#8209;34
Authors:
Boyka Simeonova et al
Abstract:
Abstract: Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) are learning platforms within universities aiming to facilitate and enhance students’ learning. In order to increase the chances for success of VLEs implementation it is essential to identify the factors which influence the students’ decision making as far as accepting and using VLEs are concerned. In this paper we are applying one of the most popular models, the so&#8209;called Uniﬁed Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model developed by Venkatesh et al. (2003) to identify and test the underlying factors influencing VLE acceptance and use. UTAUT is a relatively new model sparsely applied in cross&#8209;cultural settings and in the context of Higher Education (Straub, 2009). We are testing the model in four business schools in universities in three different countries: the UK, Russia and Jordan. The results show that although all items from the original UTAUT questionnaire have their place in the final groupings obtained through the factor analysis, the ‘clean’ agglomeration of items into groups shown by the original paper and a few others could not be replicated in the individual countries or in the overall sample despite the good sample size obtained in our study. The paper raises a question about the replicability of the original results and calls for reconsideration of the way the model is applied.

Business Innovative Environment as a Prerequisite for a Long&#8209;run Competitive Advantage
Pages:

Authors:
Marta Christina Suciu
Cristina Andreea Florea
Abstract:
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to highlight the importance of innovation in businesses. It tries to illustrate the way companies could invest in lifelong learning focusing on the entrepreneurship education in order to support creativity and innovation as prerequisite for a short&#8209;run increase in their profits and mostly for a long&#8209;run sustainable competitive advantage. In the first part of the paper, we will focus on companies. In some companies the manager is thinking how creativity could help. One person may generate 10 ideas; conversely, 5 persons may generate 50 ideas. From those 50 ideas the manager can use at least 3 of them to increase the profit. This is how intellectual capital and creativity should be enhanced. Furthermore, it will influence the consumers buying renewed products in a more profitable way. The second part of the paper, we will highlight the importance of taking into account some best practices cases. Nowadays, with Internet banking, Euro Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) and credit cards, the final user has been granted options for the monetary transactions. People like consumers want their needs to be satisfied and this is one of the reasons why they have grown accustomed to demanding more and more from their banking services providers. In the last part of the paper, we will discuss about the creativity models and ways in which these models might influence the workers and the leaders to come up with new ideas, be creative and generate larger profit. From a methodological point of view we applied both the quantitative method (surveys) and the qualitative one (in terms of focus&#8209;groups & interviews).

Abstract:
Abstract: Today, innovation is considered one of the main source of competitive advantage for the companies. For multinationals companies (MCNs) innovation is particularly important because they have more challenges to face than domestic organizations. MNCs have also a potential advantage for developing innovations, as they have access to new ideas and knowledge generating in the different locations they operate in. But this potential advantage can only become real if MNCs are able to transfer the knowledge they acquire in one of their locations to the others. This paper analyses the relationship between knowledge transfer and innovation in MNCs. In particular, this research focuses on knowledge transfer from the subsidiaries to the headquarters (reverse knowledge transfer). In addition, this paper studies the effect of the firm´s learning orientation as a mediator in the relation between reverse knowledge transfer and innovation. These relationships are tested using a sample of 104 Spanish MNCs. Our findings show that reverse knowledge influences indirectly on the headquarters’ innovation through its effect on the firm’s learning orientation. These findings have implications for both academics and practitioners.

Taking a Different View: The Case of the Eurozone Macroeconomic Policies as a Case of Incompetence
Pages:
pp56&#8209;66
Authors:
Eduardo Tomé
Abstract:
Abstract: This paper aims at shedding a new and different light over a very big problem that actually is being felt by the European Society and by the world at large: namely the difficulties the EU is having, since adopting the EURO as a currency in 2002, with its own management of macroeconomic policies, and with its own forecasts over growth. We follow Sveiby (2012) analysis as a methodology. According to that author, radical innovation generates incompetence due to inability in adjusting to the environment. The incompetence materializes itself in wrong predictions by otherwise and formerly competent and acknowledged experts. Sveiby 2012, dissects the case of the financial crisis of 2007&#8209;8, as a case in which radical innovation in the financial markets produced massive managerial incompetence with huge economic and social consequences. By the same token we assume that the Eurozone became a case of incompetence at the level of macroeconomic management. We show evidence of that incompetence because we compare the predictions before the Euro and with the Euro and analyze the impact the Euro entrance add in the correctness of the experts’ predictions. Furthermore we say that experts should take into account that macroeconomic restrictions posed by the Eurozone regulations deeply affect the economy of the more divergent Eurozone Member States. Moreover, the effect of the regulations has not been rightly accounted. The miscalculation generates mistakes in prediction of policy impacts. Those mistakes have major negative effects in the life of ordinary citizens. Therefore we believe that if ones assumes, as we do, and prove, that the Eurozone has currently a problem of managerial incompetence, the finding might have huge economic, social, and political effects The paper is original because we sincerely don’t know (and believe it is not our fault) of any study that analyzes the problem of the current Macroeconomic crisis in the EU as a problem of incompetence. Finally we believe the study could and should developed in a multidisciplinary and multi&#8209;country book.

Middle Management Knowledge by Possession and Position: A Panoptic Examination of Individual Knowledge Sharing Influences
Pages:
pp67&#8209;82
Authors:
Sally Eaves
Abstract:
Abstract: This paper elucidates the spectra of influences that impact the intra&#8209;organisational tacit and explicit knowledge sharing behaviour of the middle line, a boundary spanning layer highly capable to influence, inform and transform. The approach addresses a deficiency in research that affords an eclectic perspective across both knowledge types simultaneously and at an individual level of analysis. Advancing Ipe’s (2003) conceptual work, the Multidimensional Model of Individual Knowledge Sharing Influences integrates robust and multi&#8209;disciplinary theoretical exposition with empirical validation in four leading UK Communication Sector operators. The model encapsulates the direct influence factors of Motivation to Share, Nature of Knowledge, Opportunity to Share, Culture and the Nature of the Individual. Organisational Velocity provides an original conceptualisation of the continual, episodic and ambiguous change that reflects reality in many post&#8209;industrial settings and is expressed as the tension between centrifugal and centripetal forces acting on the other factors. All six dimensions are shown to impact individual knowledge sharing practice, with underexplored constructs such as personality traits and aspects of demography emerging as significant. Organisational Velocity can operate in a moderating and primarily centrifugal capacity on Motivation to Share, Opportunities to Share and the Nature of the Individual. The study demonstrates that a panoptic, pluralistic and interdisciplinary perspective combining human, social, technological and contextual factors must be considered to understand sharing behaviour and optimise knowledge management interventions. A particular element may not be evaluated in isolation. Further, when factor dynamics are sub&#8209;optimum, the middle line may pragmatically orientate towards personal knowledge management mechanisms. Evidence of hoarding, hiding or disengagement from sharing is identified with some managers electing to utilise their knowledge in possession and network positional opportunity to generate rent in alignment with individual and affiliated group interests, negating its aggregation for wider organisational benefit. Implications for research and practice are fully explored.

A Holistic View of the Knowledge Life Cycle: The Knowledge Management Cycle (KMC) Model
Pages:
pp85&#8209;97
Authors:
Max Evans
Kimiz Dalkir
Catalin Bidian
Abstract:
Abstract: As more companies implement knowledge management (KM), they require a practical and coherent strategy and practice anchored in a valid and comprehensive KM life cycle model or framework. Using a knowledge&#8209;based view, this paper aims to improve how firms conceptualize, strategize, and manage organizational knowledge. The paper opens with an analysis of organizational knowledge and knowledge assets. Appropriate conceptualization and partitioning of knowledge is required since the cost, benefit, and imitability of knowledge assets largely depend on their form. Subsequently, the paper provides a historical and chronological overview of some of the most influential KM life cycle models, based on their scholarly adoption and frequency of use by practitioners. Each represents an advance in the thinking concerning the KM life cycle and introduces valuable new elements to be considered in understanding how organizational knowledge is processed throughout its useful lifespan. Life cycle models examined include Wiig (1993), Meyer and Zack (1999), Bukowitz and Williams (1999), and McElroy (2003). Dalkirs (2005) integrated life cycle model and Heisigs (2009) examination of 160 KM frameworks are also reviewed for their contribution. Building on these models and prior work by Evans and Ali (2013), the Knowledge Management Cycle (KMC) model is proposed. Finally, sample KM initiatives, activities, and technologies are mapped to the seven non&#8209;sequential KMC model phases (i.e., identify, store, share, use, learn, improve, and create) to illustrate its practical use. The main contribution of the KMC model is that it provides a holistic view of the knowledge life cycle, by building on previous life cycles models and Heisigs (2009) analysis of KM frameworks. It further extends previous models by including different knowledge forms, integrating the notion of second order or double loop learning, and associating some facilitating initiatives and technologies for each of its phases.

ADIIEA: An Organizational Learning Model for Business Management and Innovation
Pages:
pp98&#8209;107
Authors:
John Lewis
Abstract:
Abstract: This paper introduces the Innate Lesson Cycle (ADIIEA) as a uniting and integrated framework for business process operations and organizational learning. Thus far, the Knowledge Management (KM) and Organizational Learning (OL) movements have tried to teach OL to organizations as an add&#8209;on while assuming that current business models are sound. Instead, we find that current business models are based on industrial age factory process work, and fail to keep up with the learning and innovation demands of the knowledge economy. This paper suggests that these current business models be replaced, not complimented, with a learning&#8209;based model. In the epistemological formulation of this learning model, ADIIEA is compared with the SECI model, and its underlying assumptions about tacit and explicit knowledge as appropriate foundational underpinnings are challenged. Instead of a noun approach to knowledge foundations (tacit and explicit knowledge), a verb approach (questioning, reflective, and reactive modes) to knowledge foundations is illustrated to be appropriately compared to required business process operations. Additionally, this approach is shown to be epistemologically aligned with the fundamental symbols of language, where we universally find the question mark, period, and exclamation point, respectfully. From this verb&#8209;based foundation, several applications of ADIIEA are then illustrated to address current issues found in education, business processes, policy&#8209;making, and knowledge systems.

Big Data and Knowledge Management: Establishing a Conceptual Foundation
Pages:
pp108&#8209;116
Authors:

Helen Rothberg
Abstract:
Abstract:  The fields of knowledge management and intellectual capital have always distinguished between data, information, and knowledge.  One of the basic concepts of the field is that knowledge goes beyond a mere collection of data or information, including know&#8209;how based on some degree of reflection.  Another core idea is that intellectual capital, as a field, deals with valuable organizational assets which, while not formal enough to rate a designation as intellectual property, still deserve the attention of managers.  Intellectual capital is valuable enough to be identified, managed, and protected, perhaps granting competitive advantage in the marketplace. So what do we make of current trends related to big data, business intelligence, business analytics, cloud computing, and related topics?  Organizations are finding value in basic data and information as well.  How does this trend square with the way we conceptualize intellectual capital and value it? This paper will work through the accepted literature concerning knowledge management (KM) and intellectual capital (IC) to develop a view of big data that fits with existing theory.  As noted, knowledge management and intellectual capital have both recognized data and information though generally as non&#8209;value precursors of valuable knowledge assets.  In establishing the conceptual foundation of big data as an additional valuable knowledge asset (or at least a valuable asset closely related to knowledge), we can begin to make a case for applying intellectual capital metrics and knowledge management tools to data assets.  We can, so to speak, bring big data and business analytics into the KM/IC fold. In developing this theoretical foundation, familiar concepts such as tacit and explicit knowledge, learning, and others can be deployed to increase our understanding.  As a result, we believe we can help the field better understand the idea of big data and how it relates to knowledge assets as well as provide a justification for bringing proven knowledge management strategies and tools to bear on bi

Abstract:
Abstract: Intellectual capital (IC) and knowledge sharing (KS) are key elements for fostering firm value, especially in knowledge&#8209;intensive firms. Management Control Systems (MCSs) have been recognized as key knowledge integrators. Recently, this assumption has been called into question as there may exist negative and destructive effects in both IC and KS fostered by a misuse of MCSs. Through a case study of 'Engineering Ltd.", this paper examines the 'dark side' issues associated by improperly implementing knowledge sharing and by imposing rules and constraints on behavior. The subject of our study, Engineering Ltd. , is a consultancy company with 10,000 employees. The case study is used to scrutinize the major risks of knowledge sharing and to introduce possible solutions.

The Learning Journey of IC Missionaries: Intuition, control and value creation

Abstract:
Abstract: The utilization of intellectual capital (IC) has often not been taken up as much as the proponents of IC may have wished. As Dumay (2012) outlines, there are barriers to implementing IC in organizations, and as academics and practitioners we need to overcome these barriers. We propose one way to do this is by providing reflective narratives of the journey the authors have taken as a successful IC practitioner and a successful IC academic. Based on constructivist learning theory (Chiucchi, 2013a) we offer a staged model of IC development (Guthrie et al., 2012) outlining how we went through similar stages in personally understanding and deploying IC. To do this, Mary Adams and John Dumay trace their IC learning journey in three stages of intuition, control and value creation. This paper contributes to the IC literature by providing an understanding of the growth a person may need to take in order to become an IC Missionary, rather than merely an IC preacher (Dumay, 2013, p. 8). If this can be achieved, we can provide a forum for open conversations about the concept of IC and the tools available so we can empower people and organizations to experience and collaborate to develop their own IC.

Working Meetings &#8209; a Tool for Building or Destroying Trust in knowledge Creation and Sharing

pp137&#8209;143
Authors:

Abstract:
Abstract: This paper discusses and examines the role of working meetings as a tool for building and destroying trust in knowledge sharing and creation. Working meetings are one of the basic tools in organizations for collaboration and group cohesion, and a significant vehicle for communication. They play an important role in information and knowledge sharing, knowledge creation, coordination, decision making, problem solving and strengthening of group relationships inside and outside the organization, and contribute to build or destroy trust. Trust is manifested in commitment, open communication, ethical behaviour, predictability and doing the best in any activity. It creates openness and freedom at the individual and group level, so it plays an important role in knowledge sharing and knowledge creation. But as necessary and important working meetings are, they are also very costly and frequently unproductive.Unless properly managed, they can be a waste of valuable financial and emotional resources, with negative impact on organizational performance, culture, innovativeness and overall competitiveness. Good meeting planning, preparation, realization, assessment and follow&#8209;up are needed to achieve meeting effectiveness. Meeting facilitators, as leaders, play a critical role to create a positive&#8209;trustworthy atmosphere and conduct and manage the meetings with effectiveness. The main point of discussion is crystallized in the suggestion that meetings have an impact in integrative group behaviour, cooperation and knowledge sharing and creation. Building and maintaining trust are of utmost importance in it, to develop human capital for sustaining vitality and competitiveness in organizations. Originality of the paper is based on exploring the role of working meetings in relation to trust building for knowledge creation and sharing. Implications are made of how to

Abstract:
Abstract:  This study examined the extent to which learners in vocational technical institutions, capture, distribute, network and effectively use information made available to them during and after lectures that are entrepreneurially and skill oriented in order to furnish the labour market with relevant school products. Development of an entrepreneurial skill is capable of equipping the Nigerian students to fit into different aspects of the economy after graduation. The study adopted a descriptive design. A twenty&#8209;item unstructured questionnaire was used to assess  150  randomly selected final year students⠒ capacity to transform ideas gained in class into creative problem&#8209;solving strategies in  three vocational technical colleges in Lagos in south west Nigeria. Three research questions and one hypothesis were used as guides to the study. Data obtained were analyzed using descriptive statistics Pearson Product Moment Correlation. The major findings revealed that there is a significant relationship between knowledge management and the development of entrepreneurial skills among vocational technical students in the area of knowledge gathering, sharing, networking and students⠒ capacity to translate some curriculum elements into the world of work among others. Given the importance of knowledge sharing, creativity, innovations and connectivity through networking in today⠒s competitive world of work, it was recommended that students be linked up with several entrepreneurs who serve as mentors to students during and after training.  Students should be made to participate in seminars and workshops that are entrepreneurially oriented. There should also be regular visits of students to small cottage industries in the form of field trips. Vocational and Technical Institutions should establish an appropriate culture that encourages students to create and share knowledge within and outside the school. There should be a collaborative effort between vocational institutions and some government agencies, for example⠒ Small and Medium Entrepreneurial Devel

Abstract:
Abstract: There is a growing recognition to the importance in using online communities of practice (COPs) as a model for teacher's professional development and as a knowledge management platform.  The objective of this research was to examine factors that promote or discourage school teachers knowledge sharing intention in their online professional community. The finding of the research provides empirical support for the overall structure theorized in the research model. Knowledge sharing intention was predicted by teachers attitude towards knowledge sharing, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control. The teachers perceptions of reciprocity, extrinsic rewards were positively associated with attitude towards knowledge sharing. The perceptions of loss of knowledge power had a negative effect on the attitude. Organizational climate positively influenced teachers subjective norm. Additionally, facilitating tools and technology was positively associated with high levels of perceived behavioral control towards knowledge sharing. Based on the findings, the study discussed implications for the theory and practice

Abstract:
Abstract: The construction industry suffers from an incomplete knowledge flow that leads to overrun cost and time. A considerable portion of this problem is attributable to the design stage which is a tacit knowledge&#8209;dominated area. Since knowledge tacitness results in an incomplete knowledge flow, we posit that adding the knowledge flows beside the workflow of the architectural conceptual design phase can attenuate both the overrunning cost and time. In order to fulfill such an objective, we integrated the Nissen multidimensional model  the knowledge flow theory for the enterprise life cycle  with Macmillans framework  the conceptual design framework  to test whether or not adding the knowledge flow to the conceptual design work flow could attenuate the cost and time overrunning. This paper elaborates on the process of validation testing by means of Simvision. Analysis of the results reveals that specifying the entity of the required knowledge during the conceptual design phase could reduce the cost and time overruns.

Abstract:
Abstract: The concept of Web 2.0 has gained widespread prominence in recent years. The use of Web 2.0 applications on an individual level is currently extensive, and such applications have begun to be implemented by organizations in hopes of boosting collaboration and driving innovation. Despite this growing trend, only a small number of theoretical perspectives are available in the literature that discuss how such applications could be utilized to assist in innovation. In this paper, we propose a theoretical model explicating this phenomenon. We argue that organizational Web 2.0 use fosters the emergence and enhancement of informal networks, weak ties, boundary spanners, organizational absorptive capacity, which are reflected in three dimensions of social capital, structural, relational, and cognitive. The generation of social capital enables organizational knowledge transfer, which in turn leads to organizational innovation. Based on this model, suggestions for organizations to facilitate this process are also provided, and theoretical implications are discussed.

Abstract:
Abstract: The rapid growth of knowledge economy in the last two decades has changed management styles. Organizations knowledge strategy should be driven from business strategy to ensure development of knowledge culture. Such a culture ensures knowledge activities, namely acquiring, sharing, creating, transforming and utilizing.  The knowledge environment will encourage and promote innovative processes.  The feedback from external environment and experience from previous projects will help in research and development.  The amalgamation of new and known knowledge will help devise ways and means of transformation for effective and efficient performance. A conceptual model is developed to study the moderating role of intellectual capital competencies in knowledge strategy&#8209;organizational performance relationship. The research studies how intellectual capital competencies moderate the knowledge strategy—organizational performance relationship. The novelty of this research is studying .relationship of Knowledge Strategy&#8209;Organizational performance trough moderating role of process innovation, research and development integration of past projects and market intelligence. This research will educate and create awareness in managers for nurturing organizations intellectual capital and managing their daily affairs effectively. It will guide in devising better strategies, processes and methods to manage intellectual capital. This will help create value through innovations and improved performance.

Abstract:
Abstract: The improvement of governments efficiency has gained great importance and validity especially in the current times of economic downturn. E&#8209;Government constitutes the most contemporary techno&#8209;managerial proposition in the track of possible interventions. The paper addresses, more specifically, empowerments necessitated by Public Administration (PA) organizations. Anchored on the needs of three real&#8209;life cases, the paper describes the conception and the realization of an IT artefact together with its methodological appeals aiming at improving information access and delivery and thus PAs decision making capacity. Our proposition constitutes a novel approach for managing users attention in knowledge intensive organizations which goes beyond informing a user about changes in relevant information towards proactively supporting the user to react on changes. The approach is based on an expressive attention model, which is realized by combining ECA (Event&#8209;Condition&#8209;Action) rules with ontologies. The technical realizations described in the paper constitute the underlying infrastructure of an Enterprise Attention Management System.

Abstract:
Abstract: Knowledge Management (KM) has come to be regarded as an important activity in todays organizations. Technology plays a crucial role in KM of facilitating knowledge flow through the knowledge life cycle.  This role is mostly realized by the implementation of a Knowledge Management System. However, the development of these systems is still haphazard, as organizations implement systems that are not guaranteed to enhance knowledge processing activities, and which may not be knowledge management systems at all. Most of these systems are groups of technologies brought together, with no theoretic and/or conceptual framework to justify the way in which they are integrated. The various forms of knowledge are not handled appropriately, as there is no distinction between the processes involved in managing these knowledge forms in the systems.  Hence knowledge distribution and use is not done consistently, efficiently, and effectively. There is therefore a need for a reference point from a technical perspective, emanating from a theoretic and conceptual framework that will guide in developing these systems. This reference point is best provided in the form of a generic knowledge management system architecture, which will guide all technological implementations for KM. This paper seeks to outline the need for a generic knowledge management system and what is to be taken into consideration in terms of technical as well as organizational objectives when developing it. The paper also presents some of the quality attributes to be considered in developing the architecture, and the technologies that can be incorporated.

Abstract:
Abstract:  The purpose of this paper is to test empirically the potential of Intellectual Capital (IC) as a driver of formation of cross border coalitions in European Union (EU) regions. The question is important given that, at present, economic and social cohesion is a major factor of stability in the EU.  We use a computational model based on different similarity matrices, for the cross&#8209;border cases of Portugal and Spain and for Hungary and Romania, respectively. We find that the results differ with the form of attraction we suppose between the regions, namely driven by diversity or conservative. At least the potential for attraction between such regions, based in IC, may be a useful approach for modeling. We believe that our model should be replicated in other EU regions, and thereby increased in depth. However, we regard our results as a promising step towards understanding some important organizing principles for the multi&#8209;regional economics of the 21st century.

Intellectual Capital Evaluation: A Project Management Perspective

Authors:

Abstract:
Abstract: Intellectual capital has prevailed as a measure of core competency and competitive advantage which explains the gap between the market value and book value of a company. Given the fact that the nature of intellectual capital is abstract, intangible, and difficult to measure, a challenge has arisen for managers to evaluate intellectual capital performance effectively. Despite the fact that several methods have been proposed to assist managers in this area, there is still a scarcity of approaches that are able to combine accurate data from financial reports and subjective judgments by experts, and that are dedicated to measuring intellectual capital in the context of choosing a set of the most promising new products. This forms the motivation to propose a method for intellectual capital performance evaluation in the field of product development projects that is based on a fuzzy logic approach. Intellectual capital includes many intangible factors, and as a result, it is difficult to evaluate intellectual capital performance using only traditional crisp values. Therefore, an evaluation of intellectual capital is proposed according to linguistic variables used by experts. The proposed fuzzy logic approach applies fuzzy linguistic variables to express the level of qualitative evaluation of each intellectual capital dimension in the context of project management. The use of the proposed approach can support the decision&#8209;makers in the choice of a set of new products that are most promising, improving the planning and implementation of intellectual capital management, aiding companies in building their competitive advantages, and helping companies achieve sustainable development.

Abstract:
Abstract: Education of people is among the basic goals as well as outcomes of modern society. It is conditioned by the current demanding and turbulent environment requiring constant improvement, enhancement, adaptation and development of the level of education. It means that education needs to be permanent, reflecting all current needs resulting from the reality of changes. Education of employees can be characterised as a permanent process in which adaptation and changes of work behaviour, level of knowledge, skills and motivation of employees of an organisation by means of learning on the grounds of using various methods occurs. It results in reducing the difference between the current competence of employees and requirements posed on them. The objective of the article is to characterise the level of the focus of organisations operating in Slovakia on continuing education and development of employees. This article aims at presenting the results of research conducted in 2012 at the School of Economics and Management in Public Administration in Bratislava and at the Institute of Industrial Engineeering and Management, the Faculty of Materials Science and Technology in Trnava. The set of respondents comprised 340 randomly selected organisations operating in Slovakia. The key condition posed on them was the size of at least 50 employees. The analysis was used for information collected from literary sources or questionnaires. All the knowledge was dealt with in smaller parts in order to enable a more detailed focus. As to statistical methods, distribution characteristics were used to express the median. Most of the collected values were expressed in % upon the results summarisation. The methods of induction and deduction were used in the article upon deriving the conclusions. The method of comparison was used upon the evaluation of the present state, comparing organisations paying sufficient attention to human resources management and organisations not dealing with it at all. To evaluate the data, the SPSS 19 statistical programme and MS Excel 2007 were used. However, the research showed that only 9 % of respondents are heading towards the learning organisation successfully, i.e. 8 % of organisations apply the approach of targeted educational concept, and 1 % of organisations declared their approach to education to be the learning organisation concept. Unfortunately, more than 60 % of respondents are at the very beginning in the sphere of education, as they only restrict their educational activities to compulsory trainings enforced by legal regulations and to unscheduled courses.

An empirical Investigation of Maturity Levels in Knowledge Management

Abstract:
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to analyse if knowledge management maturity models can be applied in corporate practice. So far, empirical studies have mainly examined the influence of knowledge management (KM) on innovation and have identified KM success factors. The underlying assumption is that more KM leads to more innovation and an improved corporate success. Therefore, a thorough KM application is recommended. Little attention has been paid to the question which level of KM application is effective and efficient for a company. This paper tries to close this gap using the concept of KM maturity. It investigates if different KM maturity levels can be identified in corporate practice and in how far they are influenced by specific factors, e.g. company size. To answer the research questions, exploratory case studies were conducted through semi&#8209;structured qualitative interviews with representatives from ten northern German companies.The results show that the practical applicability of KM maturity models (KMMM) is still limited. None of the companies can be categorized to have a high KM maturity level despite their multiple use of KM tools. As influence factors the size of a company and an externally certified quality management were identified. To validate these findings an additional online survey was conducted with 79 participants. The results of this survey support the general statements above, but also show a significant relation with the KMM level and employees participation in knowledge management and the innovation success of a company compared to its main competitor. The paper contributes to the understanding of KM maturity and its influence factors and thus provides the foundation for further empirical research. Moreover, the findings help organisations to position their KM efforts.

Abstract:
Abstract: Trust has become an important intangible asset in organizations as a foundation for cooperation in workplace relationships. The paper discusses and examines development of trust in relation to communication within work relationships. More specifically, the dynamics of trust deterioration and trust breach is studied empirically. The paper examines the interplay between communication and trust and how building, violation, breaches and restoration of trust develop in inter&#8209;personal workplace relationships.  The aim of the paper is to provide new knowledge and insights of the dynamics between communication and trust and make practical implications to leadership and HRM for human capital development. By presenting the empirical findings from a qualitative case study with other complementing data the paper also aims to shed more light on how poor communication, in particular, affects trust development between actors involved. The paper advocates the importance of developing trust and communication for intangible intellectual asset in workplaces and their management. Originality of the paper is based on the idea of exploring the relation between trust and communication, specifically in the situation of trust violation and breach. The paper provides a still under researched issue of intangible assets, since relational resources such as trust and communication have not been widely examined in the context of trust breach, in specific. In the theoretical discussion, trust and communication are seen interwoven in interpersonal work relationships. Trust is looked as intangible asset and skill and communication a means and antecedent for trust. The findings show that poor communication plays an important role in deterioration and breaches of trust. Distrust may permeate widely within the organization and beyond the original parties involved. If space is left to the low trust climate to develop the consequences may be unfavorable, harmful and even damaging to the organization. Trust violation and breaches seem to be connected with workplace bullying wit

Abstract:
Abstract: The success of enterprise is bounded with achievement of the set targets and progress of enterprise in accordance with its mission. Performance of any enterprise is determined by the level of performance of individual employees. Starting from setting the objectives, from the strategic to the operational, procedures for their achievement, and the criteria for their evaluation, is the issue of performance management which is in consideration of industrial enterprise management in their day to day activities. Access to this issue affects the success of the enterprise on the market and its competitiveness. Objective indicators are supplemented by subjective evaluation of the representatives of the enterprise. Main challenge is to measure performance in the context of corporate culture, respectively to discover relations between corporate culture and the success of the enterprise. On the basis of the partial findings in this area, we have come to the conclusion about importance of relationship of corporate culture and the success of the enterprise and the suitability to continue its investigations in more details. In this article we present results of our previous researches.

Abstract:
Scholars have approached to managing intangible elements from several perspectives throughout the literature. This field of research is still young, with no more than two decades of more intensive empirical research, which has confirmed the relevance of intangible&#8209;based elements on achieving a competitive edge in virtually every industry. Taxonomy and classifications of intangible elements have been built from either deductive or inductive methods. And also practitioners are more concerned and convinced that intangible elements are a key in the today⠒s competition, more than ever before. However, a categorization of approaches followed by scholars is still missed. The categorization proposed in this article will allow a more in&#8209;depth understanding of how intangible elements may help to achieve a competitive advantage, either from a theoretical or an empirical perspective. In addition, it will provide further information on how the different intertwined approaches relate to each other and, hence, it will help scholars and practitioners to gain a further understanding of how to implement intangible&#8209;based strategies more successfully. With these goals in mind, a search on the main databases was conducted (namely, ISI&#8209;Web of Knowledge and Scopus). Up to 4,308 different articles dealing somehow with intangible assets were found. In this paper, the title and keywords are analyzed and the content is categorized in six different themes: Knowledge Management refers to IA and its consequences in the Knowledge cycle; Intellectual Capital refers to IAs as mainly the knowledge&#8209;based economic value, divided into Human Capital, Relational Capital and Structural Capital; Human Resource Development refers to IAs as organizational learning; Economics deals with the micro and macroeconomic consequences of IAs and with the market of IAs; by Social Policy we mean IAs investment considered as a commodity which have social benefits and which are managed by social operators; and finally the Management and Accountability, where the quite old fashioned view is addressed a

Abstract:
Abstract: The recent economic crisis has caused a significant discontinuity in the world of business. Companies and researchers are constantly trying to understand the key drivers that caused significant impact on companies⠒ performance and how to challenge them in  the future. One still insufficiently covered research issue is the role that intellectual capital and its different components have played in the performance of small and medium&#8209;sized enterprises, and how this role has changed after the crisis. Intellectual capital has become a key value creation driver in the new economy. Its positive influence on firm performance has been proved by numerous empirical studies worldwide. Several of them also investigated how the economic crisis affected this paradigm. However, the body of knowledge supported by sound empirical findings in this field is still rather scarce. Therefore, the purpose of our study is to examine the relationship between intellectual capital (IC) and its different components, and firm performance before the recent economic crisis and in the period of recovery, among SMEs in different industries in Slovakia. To measure the level of IC and its respective components we applied the Value added intellectual coefficient (VAIC⌢) indicator developed by Pulic. This measure, however being criticized by some authors, is the most frequent metric used to evaluate IC and its components using financial data. We selected ROA as our performance measure... Our analysis also accounted for firm size and financial leverage while investigating the effect of IC on SME performance. We based our analysis on panel data comprising of 2008 and 2011 financial statements of 1947 Slovak SMEs operating in 10 industries (sections according to SK NACE rev. 2 classifications). These data were obtained from business information portal Universal Register Plus operated by CRIF &#8209; Slovak Credit Bureau. To compare the influence of IC on firm performance we constructed pre&#8209;crisis (2008) and post&#8209;crisis (2011) regression models and analyzed the observed differences

Abstract:
Abstract: Knowledge sharing research is growing in Latin America. Most instruments used to measure employees knowledge sharing activities have been developed in the Anglo&#8209;American language (English). Currently there is no instrument available to measure the knowledge&#8209;sharing construct in Spanish. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of the research process adopted to design, construct and validate such an instrument in the Spanish language. The validation process was conducted with 228 knowledge workers in Colombia. The instrument has two components. The first part (32 items) evaluates the different ways in which knowledge is shared in an organization. The second part (24 items) evaluates the different tools used in an organization to share knowledge. The validation process is structured in three steps: the construction of the items following a review of the literature; psychometric validation, and the statistical verification of the instruments sub&#8209;scales. Four categories of types of knowledge and four categories of knowledge sharing techniques are identified. The results of this research contribute to the understanding of a broader perspective of the measurement of knowledge sharing behavior and enable the measurement of this construct in Spanish. Many of the current instruments are very short and do not consider categories of knowledge sharing, neither tools people use to share knowledge. It is expected that the instrument will become a referent to the measurement of knowledge sharing in Spanish speaking countries. It is recommended the translation into English and the validation process of the instrument with an English speaking sample.

New Insights for Relational Capital

Abstract:
Abstract: In this paper, we concentrate on relational capital, manifestation of the old adage ⠀it is not what you know but who you know⠀. We propose that in this networked world, the importance of relationships between multiple stakeholders created by key personnel and financing becomes fundamental, and hence understanding and measuring those becomes fundamental, too. Accordingly, we highlight that there is a need to go beyond social, individual or personal relationships and organizational context, as well as beyond the limitations of the dyadic (one actor to one actor) view on relationships. Hence, we are introducing the ecosystem as the context for measuring relational capital. This paper builds on a construct of ecosystemic relational capital, created for understanding and measuring the importance of relationships in the context of ecosystems. It looks at the totality of relationships both at organizational level and at individual level, measuring the structures and characteristics related to individuals, organizations as well as the ecosystem as a whole (Still et al. 2014a). We acknowledge that the initial framework emphasizes the ⠜networking capabilities⠀ element of relational capital, with less attention to the element of ⠜customer loyalty and reputation⠀, which is the motivation for building on the construct. The processes of ecosystemic relational capital are already seen to be built on the possibilities afforded by the volumes of digital data, mostly from social media, providing details on the relationships between various actors related to various regions, sectors, technologies and products. However, we propose enhancing the holistic integration for better understanding and measuring of relational capital with the application of methods of social network analysis (SNA), network visualizations and social media analytics. In this paper, we present concrete examples of the enhanced framework. At the same time, we acknowledge that there are many other avenues for obtaining novel insights for relational capital with these analytics

Abstract:
Abstract: While intellectual capital (IC) as an asset is long noted, one area that has begun to attract attention is the communication of IC. The past decade of increasing global competition and economic downturns have enhanced the importance of the communication of IC, in particular, how IC supports organizational performance (OP).  Current literature on the communication of IC is limited to reporting metrics, which does not provide sufficient insights on OP. Yet, the need for the communication of IC is growing globally as investors are demanding for more non&#8209;financial information to reflect organizations sustainability.  Hence, the objectives of this study are three&#8209;fold. First is to ascertain the prevalence of the communication of IC, where past studies have reported low occurrence. Secondly, the study aims to examine the communication of IC in terms of content; and finally, to investigate the correlation of the communication of IC with OP. The dataset used in this study was drawn from annual reports and supplementary corporate disclosure (ARS) published for FYE2011 in English by 299 banks listed on the stock exchanges globally. The communication of IC was reviewed from three angles, human capital, relational capital and structural capital; and OP encompasses business continuity, risk management and organizational productivity. Content analysis was used to evaluate the communication of IC and to highlight nuances and trends. Findings showed that the communication of IC was prevalent in more than half of the banks in the dataset, where the communication of Human Capital content was most widely reported. Smaller banks, in particular, were found to be lacking in the communication of IC. Three peculiarities were also identified, namely inclusion of information on women, importance of training to organizational productivity, and extensiveness of risk management processes in banks.  The significance of this study lies in its effort to highlight relevance of the communication of IC from the perspective of IC components and its correlation to OP.

Abstract:
Abstract: The field of Knowledge Management (KM) is usually described in terms of generations. First generation KM viewed knowledge as an object and was focused on the use of IT, such as databases and portals. Second generation KM was orientated towards people and organisations. It emphasised tacit knowledge and communities of practice. Third generation KM recognised the importance of contextual contingencies and influences in aligning KM strategies with business strategies. Most recently, scholars have started to call for a new generation KM that will ensure the fields continued interest in academia and value in practice. The proponents of the new generation KM advocate the need for convergence between KM and other disciplines. Following the current trend, the purpose of this paper is to propose a new conceptual model that merges Knowledge Management (KM) with Project Management (PM).

Innovation Strategies as Outcomes of KM Practices and Antecedents of Firm Performance: Evidence from European Economies
Pages:

Authors:
Inga Stankevice
Abstract:
Abstract: An organisationâ s ability to successfully operate in a competitive environment hinges to a large extent on innovation performance. In the paper, knowledge management (KM) practices, including methods stimulating new ideas and creativity, are viewed as antecedents of innovation strategies, and variance in organisational performance is presented as a consequence of implementation of different innovation strategies. Which KM practices contribute to the emergence of the most and least sophisticated innovation strategies? Which methods stimulating new ideas and creativity have the greatest potential in producing innovation? How is KM, via innovation strategies, related to firm performance? Where do the differences in innovation strategies and KM practices lie across countries? The paper is aimed at answering these questions and identifying KM practices typical of innovation strategies with varied levels of sophistication. Here, the sophistication depends on coherence (e.g. positive or negative, strong or weak) between the extent of an innovation strategy of an enterprise and the enterpriseâ s performance indicators. For the identification of innovation strategies, CIS8 database was used. It covers 60 innovation variables across 127,674 organizations from 12 core and 19 additional sectors and from 16 European economies. The innovation variables include different KM practices as well. Two firm performance indicators were also used in the research. For the identification of methods stimulating new ideas or creativity, CIS10 data were used. It covers six such methods; the sample includes enterprises from 24 European economies within innovation core sectors. The methods included exploratory factor analysis, correlation analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis and k&#8209;means cluster analysis. At each stage, the analyses were accompanied by rigorous validity and reliability tests. The originality of the paper lies in its attempt to interrelate different KM practices with not only innovation strategies and firm performance, but national economic&#8209;instit

Abstract:
Abstract: Against the background of global competition and increasingly dynamic markets, the importance of knowledge has been growing dramatically, especially for small and medium&#8209;sized enterprises (SME). SMEs have to be more innovative, flexible, and efficient to successfully cope with typical challenges such as growing competition and rapidly changing demand patterns. In the past, knowledge management has been successfully implemented and developed by large enterprises in particular. In contrast, knowledge management for SME is not a matter of course yet. However, current survey results affirm that activities in the area of knowledge management depend less on the size of an enterprise or its industry, but rather on an enterprise⠒s business strategy and core competencies. In the light of these results, SMEs seem not to have disadvantages regarding the implementation of knowledge management because of their size or industry, but rather because they need to take strategic decisions to implement such solutions and have difficulties in doing so. Against this background, the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology started the initiative ⠜Fit für den Wissenswettberb⠀ to support especially SMEs on the way to the knowledge society. In the course of the initiative, the research institutes Fraunhofer IPK and Fraunhofer IFF initiated the project ⠜ProWis ⠍ Prozessorientiertes und integriertes Wissensmanagement in KMU⠀. Within this project, researchers designed methods meeting the specific needs of SMEs allowing the implementation of process&#8209;oriented knowledge management at reasonable efforts. Building up on the developed methods, both institutes accompanied 15 SMEs during the implementation of knowledge management and used the findings from these implementations to refine the methods. The results of the project are summarized in the guideline ⠜Praxisleitfaden Wissensmanagement⠀, which is freely accessible to interested parties and enables SMEs to systematically and autonomously implement knowledge management.

Abstract:
Abstract.  As cities and regions transform from an industrial to a knowledge economy, there is a need to build new working relationships among academic, business communities, labor and workforce, civil society, and the technology sector  to create Knowledge Cities. A Knowledge City values all kinds of knowledge, is grounded in an economy that runs on knowledge and intellectual capital, and encourages knowledge markets and transactions. The 21st century knowledge economy is dependent upon knowledge cities and regions, representing a major shift from the industrial economy. Transforming an industrial city to a Knowledge City is not a trivial task.  It requires that all members of the society make the transition together.  Currently, there are no institutions that can facilitate this role. This paper considers how a Knowledge Sciences Center might fulfill that role, and reports on the thoughts of over 200 participants of the Knowledge Sciences Symposium held in Canton, Ohio, and Washington DC in 2013.  The paper also references recent initiatives to establish Knowledge Sciences Centers in the Eastern and Midwest regions of the United States.  The role of a transformational leader in establishing a Center is also highlighted.

Abstract:
Abstract: Knowledge Management (KM) has already reached the level of a scientific discipline and attracts increasing interest in research and practice. As a consequence, the number of KM publications is growing exponentially. The wide spectrum of publications comprises a variety of topics ranging from terminological, conceptual, and technological approaches to managerial implementation approaches. Several attempts have been made to achieve a common ground of the KM discipline. The aim of this study is a CA&#8209;based review of a total of 755 publications published in the proceedings of the European Conference on Knowledge Management (ECKM) since 2006 and obtained from the Scopus Database. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented attempt to analyse ECKM contributions using content analysis (CA). We combine the advantages of manually and automated CA in order to detect research areas and activities within ECKM community. Using the statistical software R, we applied a manually developed KM dictionary on title, abstract and keywords of the publications to identify key research topics examined over the past years. The results are compared with existing studies. The analysis confirms some results of preceding KM studies and reveals a strong interest of the community in research topics like knowledge processes, innovation, learning and technology. Furthermore, there is an observable tendency to use established research methods for analysis purposes. Since the development of a common ground of the KM discipline is still a challenging task, the findings help to discover emerging research topics in KM research but also mostly preferred research methods. Both thematic shifts in the past and prospective future research priorities are pointed out. The results of this study contribute to the role of KM in building resilience and can be seen as an attempt to reflect the identity and the research interests of the KM discipline.

Abstract:
Abstract: Innovation processes require organizations to transcend current boundaries. These include not only technological as well as social limitations but &#8209;above all&#8209; the way we address the future. We are used to face the future with our existing knowledge and experiences from the past. This strategy, however, can hardly lead to knowledge off the beaten path. We therefore suggest a new learning approach for organizations, which enables to literally envision a desired future scenario and thereby, allows for the creation of radical new knowledge. We argue that the created knowledge yields a higher degree of novelty and radicalness. Along with an enhanced theory of learning including learning from the future, we present our empirical findings from comparing the outputs of Learning from an Envisioned Future and learning from the past. For this purpose, we use data from two organizational learning projects; one, which was conducted with a high school in Austria and another one, which was conducted with members of the Austrian Economic Chamber. Our findings from both case studies suggest that Learning from an Envisioned Future does produce significantly more paradigm challenging knowledge compared to the output gained from conventional learning from past experiences. We conclude that the combination of both learning sources may lead to best learning outcomes in organizations.

Abstract:
Abstract: Today⠒s work environment comprises of different parts of visible (explicit) and non&#8209;visible (tacit) knowledge that are frequently exchanged between people and systems. Knowledge sharing is the process of exchange of knowledge between people, communities and organisation. Most organisations characterize and focus their approach in knowledge management around their own specific business objectives. Knowledge management pexlays an important role in universities, especially in academic libraries because libraries are considered as knowledge repositories and are one of the oldest areas using knowledge sharing concept. The purpose of the research initially was to assess knowledge sharing in the seven libraries within Sultan Qaboos University (SQU), in terms of common standards, guidelines and policies for patrons. The research employed both theoretical and empirical analysis and was based on a review of best practices from previous studies and from data gathered from library staff and management. The first part of the study investigated the motivation to share, use of technology tools in collaboration and the strength of knowledge sharing culture among the staff. And the follow&#8209;up study focused on the measures initiated to implement a collaborative environment in the libraries.. The research used tools such as interviews, surveys and focus group discussions to extract the information required for analysis. Through the use of these tools the main challenges and issues facing SQU libraries with respect to collaboration was examined. The results of the assessment study were shared with the library administrative head and as a first step a training program for knowledge sharing and standardizing the management process of the different libraries took shape. The following investigation addresses the main learning and developments that took place after the assessment and focuses on the measures taken up to initiate formal knowledge sharing. Direct and indirect benefits will be explored and analyzed. In addition, the implication of applying knowledge

Abstract:
Abstract: The paper reports on the impact of  building an intellectual capital statement for the Chamber of Agriculture in Styria, Austria (Landeskammer Steiermark, LK Styria), and with the subsequent issues  of organizational development. LK Styria is a knowledge&#8209;based organization where intellectual capital accounts for a large share of the entitys value. Building on the activities of LK Styria and their outcomes, a knowledge&#8209;based intellectual capital inventory was set up for the human, structural and relationship resources based on the method Wissensbilanz made in Germany. The strengths of the intellectual capital of Styria LK lie primarily in its core competencies of promotion, training and consulting. The contexts of LK Styria that produce value are its working conditions and the relationships with their members, customers, the public at large, and with public functionaries. It was found that the establishment of an of the Intellectual Capital (IC) Statement not only enhances the performance of LK Styria but also increases the resilience of the LK Styria when unexpected changes arise on the EU&#8209;level and on the national level, and thus expands the sustainability of the organization. Consequential to this IC Statement, measures were introduced to improve processes and outputs: a central lever was to be a new framework for process orientation; enhanced quality management was to be introduced as well as newly structured information handling inside and outside the organization.

Knowledge as a Foundation of Resilience on Polish Banking Market

Authors:
Monika Klimontowicz
Abstract:
Abstract: During the last few decades, banking market has changed significantly. Systematically increasing the complexity of new technology, development of information and communication’s techniques, economy’s networking, globalization and growth of customers’ expectations combined with regulatory requirements make banks face new challenges. The most crucial of them is answering the question how to meet regulatory requirements (remain stable) and develop market performance (obtain a competitive advantage and gain profits). As a result, the concept of resilience must accommodate and balance the public interest focused on safety with individual bank’s aims focused on value’s creation, market position and profits. Defining the foundation for banking market resilience needs discussing these contradictory aspects. It is especially important as banks play a special role in society. They are crucial in financing the economy, settling payments and providing products that allow other entities to manage their financial risk and to develop their market activity. The resilience of the banking market influences not only financial system stability but the sustainable economic growth and the economy as a whole. That is why regulatory schemes should support it. On the other hand, creating value for customers and other stakeholders makes bank to keep customer experience and wider brand perceptions central to all strategic thinking. Meeting customers’ needs and expectations requires flexibility, creativity, and innovativeness what today quite often means taking a risk. Thus, a resilient banking sector should create the conditions for the integration of safety and competitiveness. The purpose of the article is to define knowledge factors that influence resilience on banking market, from both perspectives. The paper presents the theoretical foundations for banking market resilience concept, knowledge factors used to establish resilience on Polish banking market and their impact on the banking sector and main challenges facing the Polish banking sector in the nearest future.

Set&#8209;based concurrent engineering (SBCE), which is a core element of lean product development approach, has got the potential to decrease time&#8209;to&#8209;market as well as enhance product innovation to be produced in good quality and cost effective manner. A knowledge&#8209;based environment is one of the important requirements for a successful SBCE implementation. One way to provide this environment is the use of trade&#8209;off curves (ToC). ToC is a tool to create and visualise knowledge in the way to understand the relationships between various conflicting design parameters to each other. This paper presents an overview of different types of ToCs and the role of knowledge&#8209;based ToCs in SBCE by employing an extensive literature review and industrial field study. It then proposes a process of generating and using knowledge&#8209;based ToCs in order to create and visualise knowledge to enable the following key SBCE activities: (1) Identify the feasible design space, (2) Generate set of conceptual design solutions, (3) Compare design solutions, (4) Narrow down the design sets, (5) Achieve final optimal design solution. Finally a hypothetical example of a car seat structure is presented in order to provide a better understanding of using ToCs. This example shows that ToCs are effective tools to be used as a knowledge source at the early stages of product development process.

Linking Decision Artifacts: A Means for Integrating Business Intelligence and Knowledge Management

pp91&#8209;102
Authors:
William McHenry
Abstract:
Abstract: With the ability to capture ever more artifacts that trigger, substantiate, and document decisions, it has become imperative to integrate multiple streams of information from information systems/business intelligence (BI), content management, and other collaboration and knowledge management (KM) systems. This paper argues that this can be accomplished by creating a DECISION&#8209;ID that links together evidence and decision at various levels of aggregation for use and reuse in subsequent decisions. Illustration of how this may work in part is based on a case study of The MOSAIC Group at The University of Arizona, which conducted research in international computing using a KM system called the AAIS. Organizations that embrace concepts of pre&#8209;codification and clustering of artifacts related to decisions may achieve superior performance in the future.

Understanding Business Intelligence Understanding: Through Goods&#8209; and Service&#8209;Dominant Logic Lenses
Pages:
pp103&#8209;115
Authors:
Pamela R. Clavier
Abstract:
Abstract: Business Intelligence (BI) project failure rates are high and expected benefits are not always achieved when implementing a BI solution in an organization. Failure is characterized by recurring challenges that remain largely unresolved. Could a better understanding of BI and its challenges emerge by taking a step back to examine how BI is understood? To answer this overarching research question, this paper presents a philosophical perspective to understand BI understanding as a means to understand the understanding from where BI challenges stem and, ultimately, overcome challenges to realize expected benefits more consistently. BI understanding  its model of reality or worldview  is examined using a worldview framework, derived from a literature study. Worldview characteristics are identified through a study of how BI is explained in the literature and perceived by those who practise BI as a profession.  Goods&#8209; and Service&#8209;Dominant Logic are then used as philosophical lenses through which to examine both the worldview characteristics of BI and the challenges experienced when implementing a BI solution. This answers further research questions. First: what are the characteristics of the model of reality  or worldview  of BI as a discipline? Second: is it plausible that the model of reality held about BI by BI practitioners and academics influences and even represses the realization of benefit?. Research is supported through a literature study and an interpretive case study. This papers main contribution is the exploration of new avenues to overcome recurring challenges through a unique analysis of BI understanding through G&#8209;D and S&#8209;D Logic lenses using the framework of a worldview.

Abstract:
Abstract: The purpose of this research is to show the link between human resources management and the knowledge management in practice, within technological SMEs. We show that the HRM processes set up by the entrepreneur and his experts collaborators in fact reveal more implicit KM practices that are deliberately integrated into the organisation through community of practices.  The community of practices offers a new opportunity to assist entrepreneur in decision making to innovate by the knowledge management. The centrality of the entrepreneur is reduced for the benefit of the members of the community of practices. We used a methodology known as PAR (Participatory Action Research) strongly mobilized in the study context regarding knowledge transmission, training and recruiting. This methodology allows to both meet the organizations expectations in terms of management and knowledge transfer, and data production based on a scientific method.

Abstract:
Abstract: Revenue and production output of the United Kingdoms Aerospace Industry (AI) is growing year on year and the need to develop new products and innovative enhancements to existing ranges is creating a critical need for the increased utilisation and sharing of employee knowledge. The capture of employee knowledge within the UKs AI is vital if it is to retain its pre&#8209;eminent position in the global marketplace. Crowdsourcing, as a collaborative problem solving activity, allows employees to capture explicit knowledge from colleagues and teams and also offers the potential to extract previously unknown tacit knowledge in a less formal virtual environment. By using micro&#8209;blogging as a mechanism, a conceptual framework is proposed to illustrate how companies operating in the AI may improve the capture of employee knowledge to address production&#8209;related problems through the use of crowdsourcing. Subsequently, the framework has been set against the background of the product development process proposed by Maylor in 1996 and illustrates how micro&#8209;blogging may be used to crowdsource ideas and solutions during product development. Initial validation of the proposed framework is reported, using a focus group of 10 key actors from the collaborating organisation, identifying the perceived advantages, disadvantages and concerns of the framework; results indicate that the activity of micro&#8209;blogging for crowdsourcing knowledge relating to product development issues would be most beneficial during product conceptualisation due to the requirement for successful innovation.

Knowledge Sharing and Business Expertise Factor Relationships

Abstract:
Abstract: Research into knowledge sharing has predominantly utilised qualitative research methods. The quantitative research methods that built models focused upon a narrow grouping of factors. This research sought to develop a holistic model of the predictors of knowledge sharing, with expertise factors added, to qualify the value of the expertise being shared. An extensive literature review and individual / series of interviews were carried out to identify the knowledge sharing factors, of which 18 were recognised. The value of knowledge shared is dependent on the expertise of the individual, and two expertise orientated factors were developed. These two factors were based upon two self&#8209;assessment constructs, a Cochran&#8209;Weiss&#8209;Shanteau measure, and a peer&#8209;comparison measure, both of which were used to identify an individuals the level of expertise. Using these factors a model was developed that, enabled individual self&#8209;assessment of knowledge sharing and expertise latent variables. 103 participants completed the survey, and the results were analysed using structured equation modelling (SEM) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The model did not achieve a goodness of fit. There were 6 factors that were significantly related to the intention to share knowledge construct, with both expertise factors found to be significantly related to an expertise construct. The intention to share knowledge construct was significantly related to the expertise construct. This model has been used to identify 4 types of knowledge sharers. These types offer significant practical benefit for human resource activities, specifically in recruitment and organisational design.

Abstract:
Abstract: Needs that are shared by members of an organization can trigger an organizational learning process. To a large extent, needs are implicitly anchored in organizations and people can hardly articulate them. In this article, we present Bewextra, a method that allows for identifying hidden needs in organizations. Thereby, we trigger a knowledge conversion process, which is similar to Nonakas SECI&#8209;spiral. In two case studies, we present how our Bewextra&#8209;process is applied to projects in educational contexts in Austria. In a first case study, we show that a combination of learning from past and future experiences extend the scope of the overall outcome. Since learning from future experiences requires a distinct environment (enabling spaces), we present a second case study. Here, we conducted a Bewextra&#8209;process with a large number of participants (n > 170), focusing on learning from future experiences.

Mining Knowledge of the Patient Record: The Bayesian Classification to Predict and Detect Anomalies in Breast Cancer

Authors:
Souad Demigha
Abstract:
Abstract:  knowledge management, data mining, and text mining techniques have been adopted in various successful biomedical applications in recent years. Data Mining (DM) is the most important subfields in knowledge management (KM). It has been proven that data mining can enhance the KM process with better knowledge. In this paper, we investigate the application of DM techniques for mining knowledge of the patient record. The patient record represents documents of the patients examinations and treatments. Data Mining is the process of mining or extracting information from a data set and transform it into an understandable structure for further use. We propose a methodology for mining medical knowledge based on the Bayesian Classification to predict and detect anomalies in breast cancer. We use the Naïve Bayes Algorithm to develop this methodology. We illustrate the knowledge mining process by real examples of medical field. We investigate through these illustrations how knowledge is better mined and thus, reused when applying concepts and techniques of Data Mining. On the other hand, we investigate the potential contribution of the Naive Bayesian Classification methodology as a reliable support in computer&#8209;aided diagnosis of such events, using the well&#8209;known Wisconsin Prognostic Breast Cancer dataset. Finally, we will demonstrate the suitability and ability of the Naive Bayes methodology in Classification/Prediction problems in breast cancer.

An Analysis of Knowledge Management Lifecycle Frameworks: Towards a Unified Framework

Abstract:
Abstract: Knowledge management (KM) has gained popularity in recent times because knowledge is regarded as a vital resource in todays economy. The popularity of KM has led to the creation of the KM field. Organisations have adopted KM because of its association with competitive advantage. Over the years, theories, models and frameworks have been developed to inform KM research and practice. KM lifecycle frameworks seem to dominate the KM literature. Too many of them have been created over the years, thus causing confusion about which one to choose for research and practice. The study analyses 20 prominent KM lifecycle frameworks, and proposes a unified framework. The unified framework aims to eliminate the confusion created by having too many frameworks with many different processes. Quantitative and qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the 20 frameworks. Processes appearing in all frameworks were listed and counted to determine the most prominent. After eliminating synonyms used to describe the processes, qualitative content analysis was used to group them into themes. Five prominent KM processes were discovered: knowledge transfer, storage, application, creation, and acquisition (K&#8209;TSACA). The conclusion of the study is that organisations and researchers seem to focus mostly on five KM processes, hence their popularity/dominance over others.

A Theoretical Model to Integrate PKM with Kolbs Learning Model for Mitigating Risks From Exhaustive Internet Exposures

Abstract:
Abstract: Recent studies on use of Internet among youngsters suggest problematic behaviour and adverse impacts on overall health as there are uncharted boundaries of information and media through Internet.  Such related problems include Internet addiction, shyness, alienation, psychological distress and academic performance decrement over time.  As a consequence, the ability of students in tertiary education to communicate effectively and interact humanly could deteriorate as they become more accustomed to networking via Internet.  However, students nowadays do increasingly rely on the Internet to perform research under the knowledge&#8209;based economy despite concerns over reliability and truthfulness of information available from Internet.  Against such a background, we construct a framework for an optimal use of Internet with the main purpose of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM).  We argue for an interventionist approach to orient students in tertiary education to develop a strategic mindset that utilizes Internet as a source for developing knowledge about learning outcomes while mitigating the risks associated with over&#8209;reliance and inadequate uses. There are specific skills of PKM for an optimal use of Internet. These skills can be learned in the initiation of a study programme and reinforced in course delivery, which include course assessments and assignments provided. Students are advised on the validated sources, such as electronic databases and e&#8209;libraries that are well&#8209;recognized as knowledge bases for studying and learning. PKM aims to orient students in tertiary education to develop a strategic mindset that exploits Internet as a source for developing knowledge about learning outcomes while mitigating the risks associated with over&#8209;reliance and inadequate uses. The importance of orientation, on&#8209;going monitoring and reinforcing position habits through pedagogies should be emphasized. A key potential benefit of this approach is to prevent students from adopting habits of using Internet that could cause health&#8209;related problems and develop into behaviours that inhibit their future developments.

Abstract:
Abstract: The purpose of this research study was to examine the correlation, if any, between knowledge and performance management and associated strategies employed by todays organizations to increase stakeholder and shareholder value.: Each strategy was individually examined using the quantitative causal method research design in order to examine the relationship/correlation of the level of knowledge and performance activities within participant organizations, and then collaboratively examine their inter&#8209;relations. The independent variables and the dependent variables vary in each correlation research questions. The findings endorsed that effective use of organizational explicit knowledge and efficient performance are practices worth doing. Correlations between knowledge and performance and innovation and value added were found to be relatively strong. A moderately strong predictive correlation between effective implementation of knowledge strategy and performance was also found and presented, and similar findings showing a moderately strong predictive correlation between effective implementation of performance strategy and innovation are also established and shown.: Organizations can increase and create vital added value to both stakeholders and shareholder members by implementing effectively a holistic approach as an integrated part of routine practices that enhances knowledge creation and exceptional performance, which will contribute to superior results  tangible and intangible ones. The practical implications of this research will contribute to the academic discipline of knowledge and performance management. Paper relevance: This paper will contribute to the debate regarding the linking of knowledge and performance management. Further, this paper will contribute to the in&#8209;depth analysis/discussion of the importance of knowledge in innovation and velocity management.

Abstract:
Abstract: Knowledge&#8209;based economy has recently gained an increasing attention in developed countries, however, understanding the main determinants of KBE development at a national level appeared to be neglected. Therefore, this paper tends to develop a conceptual model that addresses the main determinants of KBE development at a national level in which could accelerates the growth of national asset value and leads to national competitive position. Therefore, a systematic literature review was conducted to learn from advanced economies’ practices in KBE development and highlight KBE main pillars, drivers, and process of KBE function. The review reveals that :(A) development of human capital and maintaining the value of knowledge asset are the ultimate function(s) of KBE, (B) Learning, education, ICT and innovation are the main pillars of KBE, (C) knowledge management is the process underpinning KBE function, and (D) beliefs and intentions are the main endogenous drivers of individual’s commitment to KBE ultimate functions. The findings show that the determinants of KBE development at a national level are: (1) the consideration of KBE characteristics, (2) the consideration of country position, and (3) the consideration of effective knowledge management process that acknowledges KBE function(s), however the cognitive leadership is the enabler to achieve KBE ultimate function via its main determinants. The conceptual model proposed in this paper outlines KBE main determinants and enabler to guide practitioners and decision makers in developing KBE framework at a national level.

Emotional Intelligence Competencies as Antecedents of Innovation

Authors:
Mariza Tsakalerou
Abstract:
Abstract: Innovation is the process of bringing new products and services to the marketplace. The innovation process engages mixed teams with personnel from design, engineering, manufacturing and marketing working in tandem at all times. Given the complexity of the information flows in such a process, value creation in new product development is almost exclusively based on intangible resources. The successful management of intellectual capital has emerged as a key condition for effective organizational learning in the innovation process. The study of creativity and innovation has occupied a broad spectrum of experts across the fields of behavioral science, human cognition and organizational behavior. Empirical research in the past has provided some evidence that a team leader’s emotional intelligence impacts new product outcomes. Recent research however indicates that emotional intelligence at the individual team member level may contribute more to creativity in new product development. This paper builds upon the results of a small pilot study designed to assess the way group member emotional competencies impact the success of the innovation process in the presence of moderating factor such as project complexity. The outcome of this pilot study, the design of which is detailed in this paper, indicates that emotional intelligence improves team interactions, facilitates the management of intellectual capital and does indeed affect innovation performance. More importantly, the pilot study identified distinct differences in the ways individual emotional intelligence competencies behave as antecedents of innovation. This paper seeks to illuminate these differences by examining a larger sample of engineering and management individuals and focusing on the relationship between individual emotional intelligence competencies and their effect on the collective emotional intelligence continuum.

The links between the Intellectual Capital Efficiency Ratio (ICER) and the performance of Polish listed companies from the food industry sector
Pages:
pp220&#8209;230
Authors:
Grzegorz Urbanek
Abstract:
Abstract: Currently, intellectual capital (IC) plays an increasing role in value creation for companies. IC&#8209;oriented companies are those which create the greatest value for their shareholders. From this point of view, knowledge on the level of a company’s intellectual capital and its constituents, in addition to standard company analysis based on information from financial statements, is necessary to obtain the full picture of the firm’s standing. Intellectual capital has been a subject of many studies since the first half of 1990s. Initially, the bulk of these studies were related to methods for intellectual capital measurement. Later, interest shifted to the examination of the relationship between the level of a company’s intellectual capital and different measures of a firm’s performance and its other characteristics. Within the last two decades, the members of the intellectual capital community have proposed a number of methods to measure intellectual capital and its constituents. Alas, none of these methods have been commonly accepted. The problem behind the difficulties in IC measurement results from the fact that it relates to intangibles which are largely not recognized by accounting rules and therefore are not captured in financial statements. The main aim of this article is to present a new method for IC measurement – the Intellectual Capital Efficiency Ratio (ICER). The article also examines the links between the ICER and its constituents and other measures of a firm’s performance. This article contributes to the development of intellectual capital theory, but also to the theory of Value&#8209;Based Management. Research was conducted based on an unbalanced panel time&#8209;series sample of 19 companies and a 72&#8209;year observation of companies from the food industry sector listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange between 2011&#8209;2014. This study reveals a strong, significant and positive relationship between the ICER ratio and its constituents with return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) company performance measures and a significant and positive relationship between the ICER ratio and its components and shareholder value measure – price to book value (P/BV) ratio.

Pekka Kamaja et al
Abstract:
Abstract: This article presents constructing of an evaluation framework for dynamic distributed software development (DDSD). The topic examines building the capabilities, evaluating the efficiency and scaling up the performance of globally distributed software development teams in environments that demand high operational excellence, innovativeness and other intellectual properties.Three universities and four ICT service and software companies in Finland collaborate on a research project, DD&#8209;SCALE (2014&#8209;2016). The project objectives are to investigate and develop measurement solutions, tools and work practices for managing and evaluating DDSD work. The challenge of harnessing human and social capital assets for scaling high&#8209;performing teams to fit with high&#8209;performing organizations is addressed. The research began with an explorative phase for designing the preliminary concept of the evaluation framework which further defined the research questions. The increased knowledge of the object of study brought a better standpoint to judge among various approaches for the framework. Theories of Intellectual capital (IC), Performance management, productivity and distributed software development were investigated. The results of the paper are: 1) conceptualizing productivity of DDSD operations in terms of an evaluation framework on individual, team and organizational levels with dynamic IC emphasis; 2) a categorization of evaluation indicators on three aggregation levels; and 3) a baseline construction for the framework with practical trials. Contributions to the scientific community are: 1) a conceptualization of productivity in knowledge intensive technology developer organizations in terms of dynamic IC and; 2) a model for conceptualizing how the impact of dynamic IC on productivity is manifested and seen in such organizations. Both views extend the applicability of productivity as measurement within knowledge intensive organizations. Contributions to management practitioners are: 1) management and development of work practices and; 2) guidelines in exploiting the full gain from advancements in high performing software research, development and innovation (RDI) within globally distributed setting.

Abstract:
Abstract: In the last two decades, scholars, practitioners and governments have underlined the relevance of reporting intellectual capital (IC). Analysing the evolution of IC research (Guthrie et al., 2012, Petty and Guthrie, 2000) and considering the fact that some ‘IC pioneer’ companies, like Skandia, have abandoned IC reporting, a recent stream has pointed out the need to investigate the use of IC reports ‘in practice’ (Dumay, 2013, Guthrie et al., 2012, Mouritsen, 2006) in order to understand whether IC reporting is something relevant or just a managerial “fashion” (Dumay, 2012, Mouritsen and Roslender, 2009, Fincham and Roslender, 2003). Moving from these considerations, the aim of our study is to explore if, how, and why IC reports are used by companies and if, how, and why IC measurement and reporting practices do (or do not) stabilise. In order to achieve this aim, a field study approach was adopted (Lillis and Mundy, 2005, Roslender and Hart, 2003). More specifically, the paper highlights the fact that the IC report is frequently a ‘personal business’ and discusses the determining role of some ‘key’ actors (i.e. project sponsors and project leaders) in affecting if, how, and what kind of evolution IC reports and measurements may undergo. Further, the paper sheds light on how the IC ‘lock&#8209;in’ phenomenon may occur not only in the accounting domain but also in others. Finally, it contributes to confirming the fragility of IC indicators. Differently from the majority of extant studies, this one focuses not only on the production of IC measurements and reports or on their peculiarities, but also on their use. Moreover, it adopts a longitudinal perspective as opposed to focusing on a specific moment in time. Lastly, in order to gain a broader view of IC in practice, this paper offers insights collected from several organizations, rather than from a single case study.

Editorial &#8209; Learning and Unlearning for Sustainability
Pages:

Authors:
Sandra Moffett
Abstract:
As an academic, my core function is learning. Not only engaging in personal lifelong learning but by being a central part in the learning of my family, friends, students, colleagues, business partners, and co&#8209;authors.  Sustaining learning is essential in a world where 'more of the same' dilutes its impact. We are constantly dealing with change, as individuals, as part of organizations and as consumers and contributors to society. The challenge we face in learning is quicker application, faster recovery from failure and unlearning, so we do not repeat previous errors.For organizations to survive and thrive, we must create new or modified knowledge practices, strengthen customer relationships and satisfy customers, provide ‘fit for purpose’ products and services, and deliver value. Whilst ‘getting the right information to the right people at the right time’ (Davenport & Prusak, 1998) is still at the heart of Knowledge Management, theory and practice needs to push the boundaries of what is known to reveal the unknown.  The only limitations is those that we place on ourselves.The aim of this issue is to challenge our current understanding of learning and unlearning to encourage knowledge management. While a common thread is evident in the papers, KM as a tool for learning, the papers provide a rich and diverse view on applying KM and its impact.  The first paper in this issue by Harlow considers learning (unlearning) and the impact of such on the productivity and impact of researchers in third level institutions. Commencing with the view that much of the research and knowledge at public universities was not finding its way to industry use either through licensing or other means and that various methods (i.e., research papers) of transferring this knowledge were ineffective in making this transfer. Despite strong funding provision, researchers tended to concentrate on research that enhanced their academic publications’ reputations; this is resulting in fewer academic papers. Slettli and Singhal demonstrate how tacit indigenous knowledge can be identified and amplified through a problem&#8209;solving approach known as Positive Deviance (Singhal et al., 2014).  Contributing to the understanding of the knowledge externalization process (Nonaka, 1994) the Positive Deviance (PD) approach is premised on the belief that in every community there are certain individuals or groups whose uncommon behaviours and strategies enable them to find better solutions to problems than their peers, while having access to the same resources.In&#8209;line with the argument for best&#8209;fit approaches within human resources the paper by Hermanrud focuses on how the KM practice of communities of practice can contribute to an innovation strategy in a multinational company. This article is founded on practice based theorising (Feldman and Orlikowski, 2011; Wenger, 1998), which is used to theorise on what people do when they try to develop a community among themselves.  The paper considers the implication of outsourcing and offshoring in terms of its contribution to learning among colleagues and community development. The main concerns discussed in this article are the spatial, cultural and cognitive reach across colleagues working from and to different locations on the globe from the perspective of community of practice. McEvoy considers how KM contributes to learning (unlearning) and working practices within the public sector.  By conducting an inclusive, systematic literature review of the current state of KM research in the public sector, a total of 3000 articles published in peer reviewed journals over selected time periods have been analysed for content pertaining to public sector knowledge management. From this analysis a total of 150 papers have been selected for their direct relevance to public sector knowledge management.  Initial findings of this research indicate that KM in the public sector is relatively under&#8209;researched compared with its private sector counterpart.  Despite the existing research that has been undertaken, more efforts are required towards the development of applied frameworks to support public KM initiatives.The final paper by Moffett and Reid considers KM within the private sector.  A case study, focusing on customer relationship management (CRM) is presented outlining how the company considers the strategic significance of each customer and focuses on knowledge about, for and from customers.  The results from this research inform current thinking and add to knowledge in the strategic areas of KM and CRM.  I hope you find reading this issue thought&#8209;provoking. From the encouragement of KM in young learners to established researchers, from theory to practice, these papers encourage further research and application in the field of Knowledge Management.  I would like to express my gratitude to the EJKM editorial team for their support in bringing these papers to a wider audience.  As we strive to generate rich, contemporary KM research I would encourage you all to consider EJKM as a useful outlet for your work, together we can build sustainability in learning.

Title:
Knowledge Transfer to Industry at Selected R1 Research Universities in North Carolina
Pages:
pp3&#8209;16
Authors:
Dennis Harlow
Abstract:
Public universities in the United States are divided into different levels of type by research agendas. Large public universities (typically known as R1 research oriented universities) are directed to serve the public interest by developing transferrable knowledge (patents and intellectual property) that can leverage the public investment made in these large universities and their research agendas through state and federal funding by enhancing social and commercial goals of the funding entities. This paper is an impact assessment of formal and informal industry collaboration and knowledge transfer activities study and looked at technology transfer offices, secondary information and public reports such as patent filings to determine if the level of knowledge transfers was increasing or decreasing or staying the same at three large public universities in the USA (North Carolina, UNC Charlotte and North Carolina State) and two North Carolina R1 private schools (Duke University and North Carolina State University. My primary hypothesis for the research was that much of the research and knowledge at public universities was not finding its way to industry use either through licensing or other means and that various methods (i.e., research papers) of transferring this knowledge were ineffective in making this transfer. My research concluded that despite strong state and federal funding of this research as well as private grants researchers tended to concentrate on research that enhanced their academic publications’ reputations which is resulting in fewer academic papers. The practical economic benefits of much of this research was doubtful since the correlation to outputs such as patents was not improving but plateauing over time in some cases.

Identification and Amplification of Tacit Knowledge: The Positive Deviance Approach as Knowledge Management Praxis
Pages:
pp17&#8209;27
Authors:
Victoria Konovalenko Slettli
Arvind Singhal
Abstract:
Often the answer to solving complex social problems already exists in the community as some type of tacit knowledge, but it is hidden from plain view. By demonstrating how tacit indigenous knowledge can be identified and amplified through a problem&#8209;solving approach known as Positive Deviance (Singhal et al., 2014), this article contributes to the understanding of the knowledge externalization process (Nonaka, 1994). The Positive Deviance (PD) approach is premised on the belief that in every community there are certain individuals or groups whose uncommon behaviours and strategies enable them to find better solutions to problems than their peers, while having access to the same resources. We propose five stages for the identification and amplification of the tacit knowledge in the PD approach. The first stage concerns awareness and breakout of the community “mental prisons.” The second stage refers to identifying the positive deviants—the carriers of the authentic experience and valuable tacit knowledge. The third stage suggests creation of particular conditions to facilitate the “paradigm shift”. The fourth stage indicates self&#8209;discovery as the mechanism of knowledge transfer. Finally, the fifth stage highlights the importance of social proof as the justification mechanism for the adoption of self&#8209;discovered knowledge as community members embrace the new practice. Through an analysis of two highly effective PD implementations in Vietnam and Argentina, we show how unearthing of tacit knowledge is fundamental to the PD approach, and represents a source of creativity and inspiration for finding efficacious solutions.

Best Fit KM &#8209; Linking Communities of Practice to an Innovation Strategy
Pages:
pp28&#8209;36
Authors:
Inge Hermanrud
Abstract:
Best fit Knowledge Management (KM) aims to link KM activities and other managerial efforts to the business strategy. In this case study, an innovation strategy was pursued to be implemented by offshoring. Offshoring is defined as the restructuring of a firm along a dimension, namely geography. It entails the relocation of operations from the home nation to a foreign location where the same company activities are performed (Contractor et al., 2010). While the current literature states that offshoring aims to reduce costs or tap knowledge (Persaud, 2005), the aim in this case was to use offshoring as a means for innovation. This article aims to discuss the practices that facilitate community construction in a multinational context supporting an innovation strategy. This article is founded on practice based theorising (Feldman and Orlikowski, 2011; Wenger, 1998), which is used to theorise what people do when they try to develop community among themselves.

Review on the KM Applications in Public Organisations

Abstract:
The rise in awareness of knowledge management as a viable organisational resource and potential source of competitive advantage has been the subject of a myriad of research to date. The phenomenon covers a multitude of disciplines, roles and procedures, and its subjectivity has at times mitigated its potential for pertinent study. Add to this mix, the public sector, which exhibits unusual, specific, bureaucratic and insular hierarchies which can make it difficult to assess it from a research perspective, and a pertinent case can be made for investigating the process of implementing knowledge management initiatives in this area. Today's public organisations are confronted with considerable challenges in the dynamic knowledge economy and continuously adapt to shifts in societal needs, behaviour, and expectations. To keep pace with global trends and new demands, public sector organisations have to embrace new paradigms that place the management of intangible assets at the core of their strategies. Recognising the vital role of knowledge resources in driving organisations can lead to better performance. The idiosyncratic nature of governmental institutions creates peculiar barriers for attempts to manage knowledge within the public domain. Public organisations tend to be highly bureaucratic and cloistered in rigid hierarchies which require knowledge management (KM) strategies that are able to address their specific context, and equally consider their unique cultural and legal implications. The purpose of this paper is to present an inclusive literature review of the current state of KM research in the public sector in order to further research. An extensive review collated KM articles that have interest in public organisations during the last number of years. Initial findings of this research indicate that KM in the public sector is relatively under&#8209;researched compared with its private sector counterpart. Despite the existing research that has been undertaken, more efforts are required towards the development of applied frameworks to support public KM initiatives. Inducing culture changes in public organisations and introducing mechanisms of accountability have also been revealed as imperative issues of importance in the context of KM. From an application perspective, most studies have been conducted within the education and healthcare organisations, with a dearth of research in certain important government departments such as the Police and Army forces.The purpose of this paper is to highlight the level of research into KM in the public sector and assess the benefits of taxonomising the literature. This will offer significant new insights into public sector literature and will benefit future researchers in the field. The historically dichotomous roles of public and private sector research present a unique case for reviewing the nuances of public sector KM and investigating whether there is a case for unilateral supposition of the public sector and its unique nuances and if so, is it fortuitous for this to continue. A total of 3000 articles published in peer reviewed journals over selected time periods have been analysed for content pertaining to public sector knowledge management. From this analysis a total of 150 papers have been selected for their direct relevance to public sector knowledge management.There are viable areas of demarcation in public sector literature, and these serve to illustrate a lack of research in some crucial areas, such as the emergency services and the military. The research also suggests that efforts to marry the principals of private sector KM to the public sector are difficult as the uniqueness of public sector culture and orientation makes KM reform challenging.

Authors:

Sandra Moffett
Abstract:
To survive in a rapidly changing and increasingly competitive global marketplace it is necessary for organisations to have access to accurate and timely information. The focus of this paper is to present Knowledge Management (KM) as an enabler for Customer Relationship Management (CRM), which in turn facilitates customer service excellence. The paper considers a large US print company as a case example of how customer relationship management has successfully been applied with a positive impact on customer service excellence. Understanding CRM to enhance growth and profitability is not only a priority for organisations, but a critical area for academic research. This paper presents empirical data from CRM implementation, which has been attributed to the companys’ success, especially within the customer service department. Adopting KM principles to successfully build and develop core business practices, enhanced customer knowledge is used to deliver a superior service and product range to their customer base. Preliminary findings reveal that at the centre of the business success is the strong focus on their customer. The company identifies how strategically significant each customer is and focuses on knowledge about, for and from customers. Customer data is stored in IT&#8209;based systems and extracted and transformed into customer knowledge (as phase one of the CRM approach). Combining clean and focused data with human expertise (phase 2) has led to good KM practice. Lessons learnt from Company A highlight the never&#8209;ending focus on customers and the importance of having a strategic and operational business focus for CRM implementations.

Abstract:
The purpose of this research project was to test the applicability of the SECI model to a cultural domain within an ethnographic context: the transmission of Scots folk song. Drawing on the archive of the School of Scottish Studies at Edinburgh University, the model was applied to five historical phases defined by changes in the use of media in song acquisition and transmission: oral tradition; externalization in print; dependence on literacy; audio media; and digitization. The findings show that the model offers a valuable analytical framework that can be widely applied in cultural as well as organizational contexts. In addition, the model may be used in a longitudinal analysis to describe non&#8209;static relationships between knowledge processes and changing contexts of media and society over time. In addition, the SECI model also emphasises the critical roles played by the community (or communities) in the transmission process, and the physical and virtual spaces in which those transmissions occur.

Abstract:
This paper investigates the common issues that may arise in cross&#8209;functional new product development (NPD) teams from a Knowledge Management perspective. The study has been built around a contextualized trigger, where several factors were preventing a new&#8209;born NPD team from performing effectively. The purpose of this paper is to give insights of the main dynamics involved in the knowledge sharing process throughout the application of a systematic problem&#8209;solving approach to the case investigated by the authors. Due to the impossibility of building a universal recipe suitable for every team in every situation, this work represents a compromise trying to exemplify how to prioritise interventions in a given context, in order to provide a benchmark for similar circumstances. This paper, using an action research method within a single case context, takes shape around the advises and suggestions made by authors to Electronic Connected Ltd (disguised name), a small&#8209;medium enterprise (SME) in a situation of NPD paralysis. In particular, the paper emphasizes the importance of effective leadership and supporting environment in facilitating communication, enhancing cohesiveness, fostering joint commitment and giving direction in order to enable knowledge sharing and to leverage capabilities to conclusively deliver new products.

Barriers and Enablers of Effective Knowledge Management: A Case in the Construction Sector
Pages:
pp85&#8209;97
Authors:
George Okere
Abstract:
Knowledge management is not new to construction companies, as they have been implementing and managing knowledge for as long as they have existed. However, there is the business need for organizations to continuously evaluate the effectiveness of their knowledge management enabling initiatives. With growing competition, companies must remain competitive through the deployment and use of various knowledge management enabling technologies. Equally important is the need to be aware of the factors that are related to the effectiveness of knowledge management enabling initiatives. As such, there is the need to know what those factors are, and the main purpose of this study is to identify the barriers and enablers of effective knowledge management enabling initiative in a construction organization. The research approach was a case study research design, and it captured in&#8209;depth experiences of a specific construction organization before and after the implementation of their knowledge management enabling initiative, and the major drivers of improvement. In general, the research found three key barriers and enablers to the knowledge management enabling initiative at the case study organization: awareness centered on the need and value of knowledge or lack of it, a knowledge sharing environment or lack of it, and web&#8209;enabled and integrated knowledge management systems or lack of it. It is hoped that from this study other construction organizations and other companies within other sectors would learn from the experience of the case study organization on barriers and enablers of effective knowledge management, as well as how to evaluate the effectiveness of their knowledge management initiatives.

Constitute Knowing in MNE Subsidiaries in China: From a Dynamic System Perspective
Pages:
pp98&#8209;112
Authors:
Juana Du
Abstract:
This current study examines how MNE subsidiaries constitute “knowing” in their ongoing practices in local context, with a focus on the Chinese cultural context in which the subsidiary is embedded. From a dynamic system perspective, it provides a framework to further discuss learning of organizations with particular relevance to the Asian business context. This study complements the current understanding of learning by highlighting the essential role of context in enacting knowledge in practice. We conducted 48 in&#8209;depth interviews with managers in MNE subsidiaries located at three cities in China, including: Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, which captured a broad picture of the Chinese geographic variations and the cultural context. It has practical implications for managers working in China and Asian emerging markets. This study explains the dynamic process of learning in MNE subsidiaries, and the interactions between employees and the local cultural context. Firstly, it reveals the learning nature of daily practices in subsidiaries from a practice view, which further confirms that the “knowing” process of organizations is a continuous, circular process of change characterized as systems dynamics. Second, it discusses that knowing and meaning are embedded in specific contexts of subsidiaries, which are across boundaries and faced with navigating a local cultural context. It highlights the effects of cultural context in enacting knowledge in practice by discussing contextual dynamics of knowing practices in MNE subsidiaries. In particular, the Chinese local context of learning has been examined with support of empirical data. Third, it finds that expatriates serve as channels and storehouse of tacit knowledge in subsidiaries considering the characteristics of Chinese cultural context. It suggests managers working in subsidiaries take advantages of local cultural context. It also has practical implications for MNE headquarters to expand into Asian emerging markets.

Abstract:
This article presents the results of the qualitative stage of the research of information technology based, organizational management based and organizational economics based knowledge sharing barriers in administrative subdivisions of higher education institutions. The objects of the qualitative research are the employees of the subdivisions taking part in the administrative processes of managing a particular Bachelor level educational program in one of the leading Russian universities. A research methodology of the qualitative research implies unstructured in&#8209;depth interviews with the employees of the involved subdivisions, from which interviews the constructs depicting the respondents’ perception of knowledge sharing barriers the respondents face in their work activities are evaluated. On the basis of these constructs, practical recommendations of both managerial and technological nature regarding minimizing the effect of the revealed knowledge sharing barriers are developed; possible further research development directions are also suggested.

The Modernisation of Statistical Classifications in Knowledge and Information Management Systems
Pages:
pp126&#8209;144
Authors:
Andrew Hancock
Abstract:
As technology transforms knowledge and information management systems, statistical data is becoming more accessible, available in bigger and more complex datasets and is able to be analysed and interpreted in so many different ways. Traditional approaches to the development, maintenance and revision of statistical classifications no longer support or enable description of data in ways that are as useful to users as they could be. The ability to search and discover information in ways that were previously not possible means that new methodologies for managing and describing the data, and its associated metadata, are required. The development of structured lists of categories, often hierarchic in nature,  based on a single concept, limited by the constraints of the printed page, statistical survey processing system needs, sequential code structures or narrow user defined scopes results in statistical classifications neither dynamically reflecting the real world of official statistics nor maintaining relevance in a fast changing information society. Opportunities exist for modernising the developmental processes for statistical classifications by using, for example, semantic web technology, Simple Knowledge Organisation Systems (SKOS), and Resource Description Frameworks (RDF), and for better describing metadata and information within and across multiple, interconnected information and knowledge management systems. These opportunities highlight the difficulties that come with using traditional approaches to statistical classification development and management, and encourage new thinking for different and more flexible options for developers and users. This paper explores the need to dispense with traditional practices for developing statistical classifications as cornerstones of metadata, knowledge and information management, and comments on the need to change the underlying methodology within statistical classification theory, best practice principles and how they can be used in associated information management systems.

Abstract:
The aim of this study is to investigate intellectual capital (IC) drivers that may influence Italian consumers’ decision to participate in value co&#8209;creation (VCC) activities with firms. Given the exploratory nature of the research, after a review of the relevant literature, we conducted a survey among Italian consumers to see if IC principal sub&#8209;dimensions (i.e. Relational Capital, Human Capital and Structural Capital) played a role in triggering VCC processes. Using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we analyzed 270 usable questionnaires finding that, in order to decide to co&#8209;create value with firms, IC sub&#8209;dimensions actually play a critical role. Our findings showed that the motivations (i.e., IC components) that influence Italian consumers’ decision to participate in value co&#8209;creation activities with firms are quite homogeneous and similar both for those who already participated in past in these activities as well for those who never participated. The study has several managerial implications as well as limitations. In fact, the survey has been conducted only among Italian consumers and therefore the research should be extended by a geographically standpoint. Moreover, the research analyzed only the demand&#8209;side, while it would be certainly useful to know the point of view of companies also adopting other research methods (e.g., in&#8209;depth interviews). This study provides to practitioners important suggestions and warnings about the importance of the development of IC sub&#8209;dimensions to (co&#8209;)create value with external actors and consequently suggests the importance of adopting a “open” approach towards consumers to establish an effective and interactive relationship with them. The study fills a gap in the literature, since there are not so many references in literature for a deep understanding of the concrete relationship between IC and VCC. In addition, to our best knowledge this paper is the first that explore IC&#8209;related issues from a marketing perspective.

Abstract:
When intellectual capital is built “from the scratch” in an effort to move a society’s situation to a sustainable status, there is often a need for a catalyst that triggers the endeavor. The “trigger”, in the case that is reported in this paper, was the installation of a new college in a rural community in Northern Ghana where heretofore, no comprehensive tertiary education had been available. The college established an outreach program which was destined to provide the community with increased opportunities for improving the overall social and economic well&#8209;being. This creates an outer circle of engagement through accessing government officials, local businesses, community councils, health workers, traditional leaders (tribal chiefs), religious leaders and heads of NGOs on topics like labor relations, conflict resolution, sustainability management, social responsibility, cultural diversity, and social inclusiveness. At the onset, the members of the community contributed their traditional views on these topics and how this would combine with knowledge brought in through the new college. Since rural communities in Africa have a very intimate and intense relation to nature, good hands&#8209;on skills and an abundance of indigenous wisdom, it was felt that this combination would result in a rich body of knowledge and competencies. Ultimately, a valuable base would be developed from this knowledge for an inventory of intellectual capital that can be transferred to generations of descendants. At the heart of this endeavor was the Center for Cross Cultural Ethics and Sustainable Development, an institution created by the college, to move these efforts forward. There are two perspectives which make this case relevant for new developments in knowledge management: One is the issue of what has been called the “fourth mission” of educational institutions (Trencher et al. 2013), moving the institutions to co&#8209;creating sustainability by collaborating with government, industry and civil society to advance sustainable transformation in their environment. The other is that when two bodies of knowledge co&#8209;exist, the question arises how this co&#8209;existence should be approached. This case embeds a variety of systems&#8209;thinking constructs. Which would be the best way to combine indigenous wisdom with new knowledge brought in by the college’s academicians and outside practitioners? How can a balance be coalesced between community needs that must often be satisfied short&#8209;term and needs for which long&#8209;term solutions are required? How can self&#8209;organization and relationality be conjoined? How can intellectual capital from both the traditional and the newly acquired skills and knowledge be generated in the community? The paper reflects on both the knowledge management and the systems&#8209;thinking interpretations of the case.  community) and processes self&#8209;reference and other&#8209;reference.

Abstract:
The purpose of this empirical research study is test the relationship between strategic intent (mission, vision andgoals) intellectual capital (i.e. human capital, structural capital, relational capital), and business performance targeting thesample of CKOs of 30 technology firms in the United States. A research instrument was developed from prior research andused to survey 30 CKO, CIO and VP of Knowledge Management executives from a random sample by CKO, CIO and VP ofKnowledge Management title. The research approach was a correlation/multiple regression. Strong statistical support wasfound for the hypothesized relationships. Research limitations/implications –The sampling was a convenience sample andmay not represent all CKOs in all industries. Practical implications – Intellectual capital measurement is of primary interestfor senior executives of a cross section of firms in the USA and this sample is a basis for a larger study. Originality/value –The research reported is the first to investigate the issue of intellectual capital from a cross section of CKOs and otherknowledge titled executives in the USA and the first to study directly the intellectual capital issue from the CKO viewpointwhich is from the strategic intent perspective.

Who’s on Stage? The Roles of the Project Sponsor and of the Project Leader in IC Reporting

Abstract:
Despite the plethora of IC reporting frameworks proposed by scholars and practitioners, their adoption is still notwidespread in practice. In other words, IC seems to be more preached than practiced (Dumay, 2009, Chiucchi, 2013b,Lönnqvist et al., 2009). As a consequence, various studies have examined which are the levers and the obstacles that caninfluence the adoption, use and diffusion of IC reporting practices (Dumay, 2012, Lönnqvist et al., 2009, Catasús et al.,2007, Catasús and Gröjer, 2006, Chiucchi and Montemari, 2016, Giuliani et al., 2016).Levers and barriers can be related to the technical&#8209;objective side of IC, i.e. how IC is measured and managed, or to itsorganizational&#8209;subjective side, i.e. who measures and manages IC (Chiucchi et al., 2016). While there are some studies thataim to understand the technical sides (Giuliani, 2016, Giuliani, 2014, Giuliani et al., 2016, Dumay and Rooney, 2011,Catasús et al., 2007, Catasús and Gröjer, 2006), the subjective side of IC appears to be underinvestigated (Chaminade andRoberts, 2003, Chiucchi, 2013a, Chiucchi, 2013b).Moving from these considerations, the aim of this study is to examine the roles played by the “project sponsor” (PS) andthe “project leader” (PL) in the design and implementation process of an IC reporting project. In order to achieve this aimthe results of an exploratory field study (Roslender and Hart, 2003, Lillis and Mundy, 2005) referred to Italian companiesthat adopted an IC report will be presented.Our study adds to IC literature by showing, from a practice&#8209;based perspective, the roles played by the PSs and of the PLs indifferent organizations and how they are determinant in the decision to undertake these projects, in their accomplishment,prosecution and abandonment. In particular, it emerges that PSs and PLs have a relevant role in the IC sensegiving andsensemaking processes: their specialization influence the way IC is perceived within the company and the fate of the ICreport, i.e. in determining the success or the failure of the IC projects.

Authors:
Katarzyna Piwowar-Sulej
Abstract:
In order to maintain a business competitive advantage managers have to make continuous efforts aimed ateither introducing new or developing the existing products and processes. Many enterprises implement the so&#8209;calledproject&#8209;oriented approach. The enterprises following such an approach are referred to as project&#8209;oriented organizations. Aproject and an organization cannot exist without people. Human capital is developed in the process of HR functionfulfillment (R&S, training, HR appraisal, remuneration and HR flow). In every enterprise, which implements the projectorientedapproach and uses the matrix structure, HR function takes a two&#8209;way course: in an organization&#8209;wide perspective(general HR function) and within the framework of a particular project (HR function in projects). The objective of the articleis to answer the following research questions: Q1: What kind of gaps occur in the area of HR function internal consistencywithin the analyzed organizations? Q2: What is the desired role of HR practitioners in project&#8209;oriented organizations? Thearticle presents the results of empirical studies carried out in 2014 and 2015 in 100 project&#8209;oriented organizations. Thesurveyed organizations present higher general HR function consistency than the HR function in projects. Moreover, somegaps in consistency between both HR function courses were indicated. The obtained results of empirical studies provideknowledge about the specificity of project&#8209;oriented organizations and the desired role of HR practitioners.

Abstract:
The objective of this exploratory paper is to discuss the impact of psychological capital on Egyptian employees’work well&#8209;being. Some scholars defined positive psychological capital as the individual’s positive psychological state thathas four components which are efficacy, optimism, hope, and resilience. Positive psychological capacities are states ratherthan fixed traits and they can be developed through the authentic leadership and trust. On the other hand, work wellbeing;is concerned with human potential power and happiness&#8209;oriented. The significance of this study lies in the fact thatpositive psychological capital should be an issue of concern to leaders of public organizations in Egypt due to its effect onemployees’ work well being. The significance of the study is also due to the increasing deterioration in public employees’job performance and productivity, which is reflected in the poor quality of services rendered to citizens and theirdissatisfaction with many public services offered by these organizations. The research question will then focus on what isthe impact of psychological capital on Egyptian employees’ work well being. The analysis of this study was drawn fromdifferent academic literature and in&#8209;depth interviews with three senior employees and leaders in different publicorganizations. Recommendations revealed that leaders of public organizations should give more attention to theimportance of positive psychological resources as core psychological factors that affect their employees’ performance,satisfaction, turnover rate and employees’ work well being.

Abstract:
There is increased pressure for a more active role in corporate directors’ oversight and several surveys are reporting that directors still do not have the necessary information and knowledge to help them fulfill their emerging roles and responsibilities. These factors have created an urgent need for organizations to examine their board’s knowledge deficiencies and find adequate solutions. Although information and communication technologies (ICT) have the potential to dramatically improve the ability of boards to identify, acquire, analyze and act on the most relevant knowledge, they remain under studied and underused. The objective of this paper is to develop some propositions on the way boards of directors can potentially improve their decision making process through various knowledge strategies supported by information and communication technology. To do so, we perform a “knowledge audit” of boards based on a review of the literature on corporate board information and decision making limitations. Then we relate these problems to the literature on ICT for potential solutions, following a design science research methodology. We also describe the current commercial board portal tools that have emerged to support the work of corporate directors. Our results can provide guidance to companies and their boards wishing to implement a knowledge strategy that addresses board widespread problems such as information asymmetry, information overload, and groupthink.

The Media’s Representation of the Knowledge Economy

Abstract:
The concept of the knowledge economy first came into our vocabulary more than 60 years ago when accountants and economists observed a shift in our national accounts. The study of knowledge economics is now a well&#8209;established academic discipline, with several peer&#8209;reviewed journals. This paper begins to explore how the knowledge economy is understood outside of academia. This exploratory research investigates how the concept is represented in the print media around the world. The research reviews 771 print media stories focused on the knowledge economy found in LexisNexis. A linguistic register is created to understand the language of the media stories. Each story is analyzed with two semantic profiles – one representing the World Bank’s characterization of the knowledge economy and one focused on the nature of intellectual capital. The results suggest that the print media has a suboptimal understanding of the knowledge economy. The research team further examined the representation of the knowledge economy within the discourse of primary sources (e.g., economic think tanks, knowledge economists, labor and trade unions, professional associations), and the representation of knowledge economists in the media. The research suggests there is a need for increasing the public discourse around the knowledge economy, in particular through media sources and among primary source institutions.

Rationale for KM Education and Training Beginning in Primary School

pp242&#8209;256
Authors:

Julie J.C.H. Ryan
Abstract:
The paper identifies KM competencies by examining the unrecognized indications that KM concepts independently exist in educational systems. It suggests introducing KM education and training in primary, secondary, and vocational schools and a shift to specifying educational objectives based on competencies rather than subject. Qualitative approaches were used to identify omissions and needed clarifications in educational objectives by examining educational objectives, models, and guidelines. This paper “discovers” unnamed KM in today’s educational systems. It provides definitions for competency terms for educational guidelines and identifies the foundational skills needed from both economic and social perspectives. It reveals long&#8209;standing definitional shortfalls that can be rectified by defining appropriate terms. It concludes by recommending a transition to competency&#8209;based concepts as guidelines. Competency terms for KM, all three of Bloom’s domains, and the skills of making and doing, are required. Socialization needs for acculturation require amplification. KM education and training should be introduced in primary, secondary, and vocational schools to improve employability. Reviewed policy guidelines are limited to US and UK sources; other sources might provide additional insight. Socialization and science are not developed in competency word format. KM is discovered to be justified by educational guidelines, current curriculums, and unstated needs in educational objectives; justification does not rely on traditional KM sources. KM competencies complement other basic competencies in acculturating and preparing people for the modern workforce. Recognizing KM competencies as foundational competencies indicates that knowledge and KM topics should be included in primary, secondary, and vocational education and training. Collectively, the suggested terms more clearly identify competencies needed in a knowledge society and provide an alternative as guidelines to the subject approach currently used.

Abstract:
This paper discusses trust as a foundation for integrative negotiations, where strategy and information sharing play a critical role. In the increasingly global and interconnected economy, negotiation processes became a vital part in the political, social, economic and particularly business spheres, and have evolved over time. Building integrative negotiations relies on trust among the parties, affecting the process of information and knowledge sharing during the negotiation meetings. By presenting empirical findings, the purpose of the paper is to provide theoretical views and insights for further research, and practical implications for negotiators and professionals in general. Trust has emerged as an increasingly important intangible and intellectual relational asset in and between organizations, developed and sustained in interaction between people. Trust forms a foundation for collaboration and co&#8209;operation in and between organizations. The research questions are: i) what role does trust/distrust play in integrative negotiations; ii) how trust/distrust manifest during the negotiation meetings; iii) how trust and negotiation strategy affect information sharing in integrative negotiations. Empirical findings are presented based on qualitative data from two cross&#8209;cultural case studies related to negotiation processes in different contexts &#8209; international trade at the governmental level, and contract negotiation within a private enterprise – implying four countries in Latin America, Asia and Europe.

Abstract:
: This paper explored the effect of trust and perceived reciprocal benefit on students’ knowledge sharing via Facebook and on students’ academic performance and reputation. The research model was tested using 170 undergraduate students in Malaysia via structural equation modeling. The results show that trust and perceived reciprocal benefit are two strong predictors of knowledge sharing amongst students, which affects their academic performance and recognition. Students with high levels of altruism are more open to sharing knowledge without preconditions compared to those with lower levels of altruism. The findings of this research would help educational institutions use Facebook as a knowledge sharing platform and also convert their academic procedures to an e&#8209;learning environment with Facebook as its platform. Creating a virtual environment and facilitating knowledge sharing among students will encourage a more productive and constructive learning environment. Facebook groups are regarded as an online community that increase students’ interaction, collaboration, and trust.

Engaging Layers of Intangibles Across Intelligent Learning Ecosystems for Competitive Advantage

Authors:
Helen Rothberg
Scott Erickson
Abstract:
The Intelligent Learning Ecosystem (ILE) integrates all forms of intangible assets, recognizing not only tacit and explicit knowledge, but also big data and analytics/intelligence within and across organizations. The ILE structure provides a system for dynamic learning through the synthesis and analysis of intangible assets, creating decision&#8209;impacting intelligence across the organization and its partners. Here we extend our understanding of how this ecosystem works by also considering the learning dynamics of individuals and teams. As such, the ILE not only facilitates organizational and partner learning but also leverages the positive impact of intangibles management on employee development, team sophistication and company competitiveness.Consequently, this paper studies the place of knowledge assets in a wider conceptual framework. By managing that wider range of intangible inputs with a structure designed not only to exchange existing knowledge or data but also to create new learning and insights, decision&#8209;makers can accomplish several things. Initially, the range of potentially valuable inputs is increased, bringing in a more diverse set of intangibles that might have more relevance in specific industries or companies. Secondly, the structures can be designed not only to exchange knowledge or big data but to bring it all together, along with all other available intangibles, for analysis. As a result, new learning can take place as cross&#8209;functional teams derive insights from the inputs. Finally, such a structure can work not only within a single enterprise but across its wider network of collaborators. The resulting intelligence learning ecosystems bring an even wider range of inputs, diverse perspectives, and opportunities for new learning to all the partners. By looking more widely at these possibilities, knowledge assets can be employed even more productively than when considered only in traditional knowledge management systems.

Relating Successful Business Models to Intellectual Capital and Knowledge Management Practices
Pages:
pp48&#8209;55
Authors:
Christian Nielsen
Abstract:
There are a number of natural links between the fields of business models and knowledge management. The contemporary understanding of business models is that they are concerned with describing and analyzing the methods of value creation and the alternative ways of delivering use value to customers that are applied by organizations. Similarly, knowledge management also has intricate connections with mechanisms of value creation, through the structuring and improvement of knowledge processes in a given organization. Ensuring that the right knowledge is present is an important part of any business model innovation exercise. By applying the lens of intellectual capital, a natural link between business models and knowledge management is established. From this link, it is possible to structure and describe key characteristics. This paper accounts for the relationships between business models and knowledge management, mediated by intellectual capital, and draws up a schema by which the relationships can be described and discussed. It concludes by synthesizing a future research agenda to further address these relationships and to strengthen our understanding of how they improve the value creation of organizations.

Title:
The Process of Creating Value With Intellectual Capital Practice as An Intangible Asset in Communities of Practice in The SME: An Empirical Case Study
Pages:
pp73&#8209;83
Authors:
Bjarne Christensen
Abstract:
In the realm of knowledge management, great emphasis has been put on intellectual capital (IC) as an important and, partially, intangible asset for achieving economic value and competitiveness. This has led to many attempts to measure the economic value of IC. These methods, however, are to some extent questionable and do not seem to be recognized in practice, scholars claim. This might be due to the intangible character of IC. Even though scholars have conducted studies on IC, more research on IC practice and the value creation process with IC is called for; especially in the context of a small to medium&#8209;sized enterprise (SME). Based on an empirical and qualitative case study of an SME, the current paper explores the process of IC practice creation and how IC practice is related to value in tangible&#8209;intangible dynamics in the SME. The current paper applies practice theorising and the community of practice (CoP) approach to propose how IC practice can create value by integrating intangible knowing about end consumers in the practice of producing tangible output. The empirical results illustrate how establishing communities of practice and fostering knowledge brokers facilitating meaning&#8209;negotiating processes is crucial to developing IC practice as intangible assets in the SME, and the paper discusses how making the intangible knowing tangible may increase the value of intangibility in the process of creating IC value and IC practice.

Title:
Identifying Layers of Intellectual Capital by Analyzing Unique Contexts

Abstract:
This research analyzed the Intellectual Capital (IC) in churches, noting the contextually specific elements tied to unique definitions of success. It aimed to open up to questioning the traditional classifications of IC, while considering the importance of context. American churches were chosen to uncover unique layers and attributes of IC, as they represent a very different organization from those typically studied in IC research. The leadership teams of four churches engaged in 90&#8209;minute focus groups, where they discussed success, assets, liabilities, and attempts to leverage value from assets. By approaching it qualitatively, and without prompting participants about the traditional definitions of IC, a more valid and natural discussion revealed unique assets not found in other contexts. Analysis validated the traditional three&#8209;part classification of IC into human, relational, and structural assets, yet it showed unique subcategories not captured by previous research. It outlined unique relationships among asset classifications, and revealed areas of missed opportunity and leakage of assets. This adds to the growing list of possible specific IC assets that can be considered by other organizations, as well as ways to leverage these assets. Analysis also found that assets can easily become liabilities if not properly managed and maintained. This approach can be used in future research to uncover additional layers of IC that can be used by other organizations not previously aware of the existence or potential value of such assets.

Abstract:
Several challenges face the notion of accountability in the context of non&#8209;profit organizations. Included among these are multiple principle stakeholders with different objectives, interests, and level of influence, as well as output that is intangible or difficult to measure. In order to align stakeholders’ contradictory interests, for&#8209;profit organizations employ market mechanisms. The non&#8209;profit sector, however, lacks this type of regulation. It is suggested that governing bodies should adopt the responsibility of aligning various interests with the mission of the non&#8209;profit organization. This paper addresses the issue of accountability for intellectual capital in the context of a non&#8209;profit organization using the case of Severstal Corporate University. It approaches accountability by examining accountability practices that are socially constructed in their settings in terms of accountability relationships, the content of accounts, and justification mechanisms. The study suggests that accountability is constructed through the interaction of two subjects: ‘spaces’ and ’logics’. The study contributes to the research on accountability for IC in non&#8209;profits by demonstrating how the mechanisms of customer feedback, reputation and ‘corporate rumors’ can be used in the alignment function of the governing bodies. Furthermore, the study contributes to the field of IC by suggesting a new framework/guidance for the organizations that do not use IC reporting but nonetheless want to provide stakeholders with IC information.

Abstract:
In today’s competitive business market, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are seeking to adopt supporting tools in order to survive. Many large organizations have been successfully implementing Knowledge Management with productivity and efficiency gains cited. SME’s on the other hand are less familiar with this practice with fewer published studies of Knowledge Management focusing on SMEs. Studies which draw global comparisons of Knowledge Management practices in SME’s are particularly rare. The aim of this study is to identify and investigate similarities and differences in Knowledge Management practice between SMEs in UK and Thailand within the manufacturing sector. The objective being to better understand and facilitate the transfer of good practice and lessons between the two countries. Questionnaires investigating Knowledge Management practice have been developed and distributed to SMEs in the Manufacturing Sector across the UK and Thailand. This paper reports on the responses of a total of 384 questionnaires from 36 manufacturing companies from the UK and Thailand. The study covers a range of manufacturing sectors including food and beverage, automotive and aerospace industries etc. Findings are reported from each of the two countries followed by a comparative statistical analysis of the similarities and differences. The results show a significant difference between the numbers of manufacturing SME’s that have implemented a formal knowledge management approach. With significantly more Thai organisations reporting the adoption of formal knowledge management approaches. Similarities exist in the encouragement given to employees for knowledge management activities. Significant difference exists in the barriers that the UK and Thai organisations face in capturing knowledge. The results have the potential to gain improvements and competitive advantage through understanding how knowledge management is influenced by geographic and cultural differences and the transfer of lessons and good practice between Thailand and the UK.

Abstract:
The importance of universities as knowledge hubs is increasing due to knowledge production via research and teaching. An emerging aspect of knowledge management literature is the study of the knowledge requirements of universities. In particular, the transformation from knowledge creation to knowledge sharing has proved to be important in the university context and is subject to cultural differences. For example, previous research has indicated that a physician’s Tacit Knowledge Capacity (TKC) is affected by social software and social media. This creates opportunities to carry out new research on different occupations that have an intense TKC.As part of this research, a survey was conducted in order to assess the TKC of lecturers in both Germany and North Cyprus. These are two countries that have universities providing knowledge management programmes. The research determined the TKC in both countries and compared the two in order to determine if cultural factors affect the TKC of the profession. Through this research, the authors aimed to contribute to the ongoing research on the knowledge requirements of universities that will enable them to be knowledge intensive institutions. The Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences at Near East University, which has 2200 students and 20 chairs, was compared with the Faculty of Business and Economics at the Technische Universität Dresden, which has 2800 students and 23 chairs. The study was carried out to provide an intercultural comparison, which is currently lacking in the Knowledge Management field. The research findings have highlighted the factors influencing the transfer and the accumulation of tacit knowledge.

Intellectual Capital and BI&#8209;tools in Private Healthcare Value Creation
Pages:

Authors:
Milla Ratia
Abstract:
The demand for data&#8209;driven decision making in the healthcare sector has increased, not only on the clinical side, but also from the managerial perspective; this is especially true in the private healthcare sector.Utilisation of internal and external data requires certain capabilities, such as intellectual capital (IC), as different data sources (structural capital) and organisational competences (human capital) can become organisational value. We study the utilisation of business intelligence (BI) tools and IC dimensions in creating value in the Finnish private healthcare sector.IC components and a modified value creation capabilities model are used as a framework for considering data utilisation and BI tools’ role in value creation. Our study includes private healthcare organisations in Finland and management and BI technology consulting representatives. Thematic interviews of key personnel responsible for BI were conducted to elucidate the value creation capabilities, IC components and BI tool utilisation in the Finnish private healthcare industry. Data&#8209;driven decision making is currently one of the most discussed topics in private healthcare sector organisations. By analysing the current data source utilisation and organisational competences in data utilisation, we gain a better understanding of IC and BI tool–enabled value creation in private healthcare organisations. The study’s outcomes will provide valuable information and a deep understanding concerning the influence of BI tools and IC dimensions on value creation in private health care in Finland. In addition, it will provide insight into future&#8209;oriented value creation factors that can enable new business concepts for private healthcare companies. Advanced capability of data utilisation will increase the value creation ability in private healthcare sector companies. However, in addition to the technology and data, human capital or capability of BI tool utilisation and data&#8209;driven decision making are crucial.

Abstract:
This paper explores the extent to which small medium Architecture, Engineering and Construction firms (AEC) in the construction sector implement knowledge management (KM) approaches. Using data from semi&#8209;structured interviews of twenty&#8209;eight AEC firms operating in the construction sector, KM needs and challenges are analyzed and discussed. Breakdown of SME’s into micro, small and medium sub&#8209;categories reveals that the management of, in particular, tacit knowledge becomes complicated as firms grow in size. Results show that microenterprises to a great degree do not experience problems in the effective management of knowledge due to the organizational context where owner managers retain total control of the business. The most significant problem areas in the small and medium categories, on the other hand, emerge during conversion of tacit knowledge into explicit, followed by the unorganized storing of digital folders by employees and in accommodating heavy e&#8209;mail traffic. Thus, best practices aligned with the needs of firm size are recommended.

Abstract:
As a tool of Knowledge Management, knowledge cartography is used, in this paper, to enhance knowledge identification, sharing, representation and visualization in a healthcare organization as well as to deliver healthcare services and improve communication between healthcare professionals.The Know&#8209;How and Knowing&#8209;That concepts are used, in this paper, instead of the knowledge concept. Know&#8209;How is defined as the capacity to perform an action and Knowing&#8209;That is defined as a belief state related to a description which can be factual or prescriptive. For the construction of Know&#8209;How and Knowing&#8209;That cartography, a knowledge cartography methodology is proposed. It is composed of three steps: (i) identifying the concepts to visualize, (ii) identifying the graphical elements and (iii) choosing the cartography technique. This cartography is experimented in the ASHMS (Association of Protection of Motor Disabled of Sfax) to facilitate Know&#8209;How and Knowing&#8209;That identification, characterization and visualization.

Knowledge Sharing and Organizational Culture Dimensions: Does Job Satisfaction Matter?

Abstract:
The aim of this study is to examine how job satisfaction influences the relationship between company performance, knowledge sharing, and organizational culture, perceived through the prism of Hofstede’s cultural dimensions, controlled by company size and staff position. A survey of 910 Polish employees (mainly knowledge workers) with different roles and experiences across different industries was conducted. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The findings prove that job satisfaction is a strong mediator for company culture dimensions and knowledge sharing by the high skilled employee. The influence of masculinity, long&#8209;term perspective, and collectivism on knowledge sharing are fully mediated by job satisfaction. Uncertainty avoidance and power distance are partially mediated. The relationship between job satisfaction and company performance is complementarily mediated by knowledge sharing. For optimum company performance, it is important to create a company culture that, first, increases job satisfaction and, second, enhances knowledge sharing. Job satisfaction of knowledge workers in Poland is influenced by low power distance, teamwork, and long&#8209;term perspective, and clear rules, strength, and a dominant and assertive male style of management lead to knowledge sharing. The main value of this study is the complete picture it provides of the mediation function of job satisfaction for company culture and knowledge sharing and performance based on a multi&#8209;sector sample.

Abstract:
The purpose of this research is to better understand the interaction between notable structural and relational factors, which positively influence organizational knowledge sharing. Specifically, to investigate the effects of multiple dimensions of trust (i.e., competence&#8209;, integrity&#8209;, benevolence&#8209;based perceived trustworthiness) on the relationship between tie&#8209;strength and effective knowledge sharing. Knowledge sharing was examined in two ways, first through the knowledge receiver’s perception of how useful the shared knowledge was, and second through their willingness to use that knowledge. Willingness to use was further classified into explicit and tacit forms of knowledge. A total of 275 surveys were collected from legal professionals, working on projects, at one of Canada’s largest law firms. Data were analyzed using linear regression, mediation, and moderator analyses. The study revealed four main findings. The first was that strong ties lead to the receipt of useful knowledge. Second, both competence&#8209; and integrity&#8209;based trustworthiness strongly mediated the link between strong ties and receipt of useful knowledge. Third, when trust was taken into account, any positive effect of strong ties on the receipt of useful knowledge was removed. Fourth, the mediating effect of competence&#8209;based trustworthiness was of similar magnitude for willingness to use explicit and tacit knowledge. Practical implications suggest organizations should cultivate competence&#8209; and integrity&#8209;based trustworthiness and develop networks consisting of both weak and strong ties, balancing network density and range.

Abstract:
The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between firm’s innovation and knowledge sources in Baltic countries. We focus on Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, since for these countries, the relationship between innovation and knowledge is unexplored from an empirical point of view. There is a theoretical background on the different types of knowledge that influence a firm’s innovation level. By using firm&#8209;level data of the Community Innovation Survey (CIS 2014), we observe this relationship in the specific sub&#8209;category of the manufacturing sector in Baltic countries, and consider a range of control variables. Our findings highlight a positive and consistent relationship between knowledge sources and innovation.

Knowledge Creation in a Participatory Design Context: The use of Empathetic Participatory Design

Authors:

Abstract:
The growth and penetration of Internet across developing countries has led to availability of a plethora of ICT applications. Quite often, potential users of these applications hold varying perceptions, both negative and positive, in respect of potential usefulness. This in turn, results into variations in adoption outcomes.  The extant literature posits that 80% of user perceptions are negative while only 20% of their perceptions towards available ICT application are positive. The negative perceptions inevitably results in low adoption or at times even non&#8209;adoption of applications, which then remain under or un&#8209;utilized.  This paper reports on a participatory action research study, which explores how ICT application adoption may be enhanced through ‘empathetic participatory design’ as a method for creating knowledge that may have meaningful application utility. This is achieved through user behavioural simulation. The main mode of data collection and analysis was the repertory grid technique used to elicit constructs from simulated prototyped elements of a selection of applications. In this paper, the knowledge creation process involves the use of design scenarios and use&#8209;cases from the typical users’ point of view during co&#8209;problem discovery and scoping in respect of problems identified by the user community. The findings of this paper reveal that a co&#8209;design approach results in reflective experiences, that create a hybridity of knowledge which is both tacit and explicit, reciprocating each other to enrich the design outcomes of the applications. We argue that knowledge is not only a belief of knowing and thinking but rather has the ability to be transformed into real action. The paper posits that tacit and explicit forms of knowledge are inextricably linked and that knowledge is created and expanded through social interaction between tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge using modes and methods of ‘knowledge conversion’.

Further Insight into Knowledge Transfer in Post&#8209;acquisition Integration: A Case Study in a MNE
Pages:
pp66&#8209;78
Authors:
Sylva Žáková Talpová
Abstract:
Ineffective integration is commonly referred to in the literature as one of the reasons why mergers and acquisitions fail to meet expectations. An essential driver of post&#8209;acquisition integration is the transfer of knowledge&#8209;based resources. Efficient knowledge transfer in the post&#8209;acquisition phase contributes significantly to the ultimate success of the acquisition. In this paper, a longitudinal case study approach is used to examine factors in the post&#8209;acquisition integration of a MNE (multinational enterprise) that can directly or indirectly affect knowledge transfer, and to link them to their possible causes. Specifically, it focuses on factors in the areas of culture, language, communication and technology. To explore the development of post&#8209;acquisition integration in the cross&#8209;border setting, research was conducted four and six years after the acquisition both in the acquiring and the acquired unit. Results from an in&#8209;depth interview and questionnaires show that the majority of negative factors influencing knowledge transfer in post&#8209;acquisition integration could be minimized by proper and focused due diligence and more importantly, by a highly&#8209;developed integration plan. The findings may be of considerable interest to medium&#8209;sized companies acquiring entities abroad and could benefit future research into knowledge transfer in the post&#8209;acquisition integration in an international setting.

Title:
Toward a Deeper Understanding of Competitive Knowledge Assets
Pages:
pp79&#8209;88
Authors:
Scott Erickson
Helen N. Rothberg
Abstract:
Knowledge management (KM) is founded on an underlying assumption that better management of knowledge assets will lead to more competitive success, including better financial performance.  Demonstrating that relationship has always been a core concern of the discipline.  KM scholarship has demonstrated that differences exist in knowledge assets, requiring different approaches for successfully exploiting them.  With the growth of use of other intangibles such as big data systems and business analytics/intelligence, the strategic choices have become even more complex.  Everything from expensive information technology&#8209;based KM systems to communities of practice, from data monitoring to predictive analytics might be appropriate in a given scenario. Metrics have developed to assess these different competitive situations, giving us a general idea of the levels of data, explicit knowledge, tacit knowledge, and intelligence in any given industry.  The methodology and results have been extensively covered in other work and so will not be repeated here.  But this paper starts from those established quantitative metrics.  Thus, we know that industries such as pharmaceuticals require competence in managing all intangibles.  Others, such as financial services, seem to develop very little knowledge even though big data and intelligence levels are very high.  Alternatively, branded consumer goods often have high levels of knowledge but little intelligence. We can speculate on where particularly high intangible asset development, specifically in which particular areas (e.g. operations, marketing relationships, R&D).  What we don’t have is empirical evidence to back up such speculation.  If the key competitive requirement, leading to better financial performance, is highly developed knowledge in operations, can we provide some data to support that conclusion?  This paper will explore some additional metrics (key personnel, brand equity, social media sentiment), seeking to add to our more specific explanations about how and where intangibles matter.  The point is to develop some more precise, more objective metrics allowing a deeper look inside organizations.  If so, we can gain a better understanding how intangible assets, especially knowledge, contribute to competitiveness.

The Times They are (Not?) A&#8209;Changing: Recent Trends of Knowledge Management Literature

pp89&#8209;99
Authors:

Abstract:
After almost 3 decades, the literature on knowledge management (KM) has gained importance. Today, many journals and international conferences are explicitly oriented to KM research, and many others propose special issues or special tracks on KM. The increasing number of studies and publications raises the question of what direction KM research is taking. This paper aims to explore the current trends in KM research by providing an analysis of the literature. It is based on two sources of data: first, some existing reviews of the KM literature, with the goal to analyse if these studies converge towards consistent conclusions; second, the proceedings of a long&#8209;running and popular international Conference on KM (the European Conference on Knowledge Management), where a quantitative analysis was carried out to understand the main streams in this field of study. The overall picture is that of a field of study with a flourishing literature and lively debate, but that it is still struggling to define its “identity”.

Application of Boundary Objects in Knowledge Management Research: A Review

Abstract:
Knowledge is considered to be a corporate asset, but in practice it is grounded in different organisational functions and is stored in repositories and in individuals’ memories. Boundary objects have an important role in promoting knowledge sharing and transfer within and across social boundaries. These objects help individuals to learn from each other and to share their knowledge between and within groups. This study explores the nature of boundary objects as socio&#8209;technical constructs that relate to the practice of knowledge management. The researchers used a critical literature review of boundary objects use in the context of the knowledge management landscape.  Relevant articles published in English between 2008 and 2018 were retrieved from Web of Science. Analysis of the selected studies indicated that boundary objects contribute significantly to the development of shared understanding, knowledge creation and innovative thinking. These objects play different types of role in supporting knowledge practices within and across organisations. The findings also show that, while performing similar enabling roles in different contexts, the impact and use of different types of boundary objects (i.e., semantic, syntactic, pragmatic and metaphoric) varied significantly. Boundary objects may also help to coordinate interaction in the absence of intended coordination by the actors. It is recommended that, in order to get maximum benefit from the power of boundary objects and to strengthen their role, it is important for an organisation to identify, create and facilitate its use in knowledge management.

Decentralizing Knowledge Management: Affordances and Impacts
Pages:
pp114&#8209;130
Authors:
Ulrich Schmitt
Abstract:
Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) is envisaged as a decentralizing Knowledge Management (KM) revolution and as a vital educational concern. The objective of a current design science research (DSR) undertaking is, thus, the conceptualizing and prototyping of a PKM System (PKMS) aiming at departing from today’s centralized institutional solutions and at strengthening individuals’ sovereignty and collaborations, not at the expense of Organizational KM Systems, but rather as the means to foster a fruitful co&#8209;evolution. This article expands on a recent paper focussing on the PKMS’s affordances in the context of the individual and collective, explicit and tacit knowledge of knowledge workers by integrating twelve renowned models of knowledge creation in a three&#8209;dimensional dynamic ‘public&#8209;transport&#8209;like’ map of holistically portrayed complementing work flows. In further detailing the impacts and benefits for a prospective PKMS user community, the article highlights the major radical changes of the PKM approach according to the decentralization, mobilization, accessibility, granularity, traceability, transdisciplinarity, transparency, diffusibility, negentropy, and synergies of knowledge. The results reaffirm the DSR concept of theory effectiveness aspired to in terms of the system’s utility and communication as well as the PKMS as a sustainable intervention to confront opportunity divides independent of space (e.g., developed/developing countries), time (e.g., study or career phase), discipline (e.g., natural or social science), or role (e.g., student, professional, or leader).

Abstract:
Management is one of the key factors of ensuring and developing the organizational learning ability. The paper analyses the impact of changes in management on organizational learning (hereinafter OL) in a business school of a public university. A fundamental change in the management system was carried out in one public university in Estonia, which replaced the academically democratic elections of the rector, deans and directors with a management model that is typical for business organisations, where the heads at all levels are nominated. To identify the impact of changes in management on the organizational learning, Watkins` and Marsick’s learning organization questionnaire (DLOQ) has been used in the research.  This research differs methodically from the classical application of DLOQ, which measures the absolute value of organizational learning. Therefore the members of business school were asked to evaluate changes in OL using DLOQ in comparison with the period prior to the reform. For that, the respondents were asked to rate the DLOQ characteristics on a scale from &#8209;3 to +3, where a negative score means that the characteristic has become worse after the reform and positive scores imply that they are now better. The results show that changes in the management affects the most the part of OL that is measured by DLOQ dimensions “foster inquiry and dialogue” and “promote collaboration and team learning”. The reasons pointed out are the loss of confidence in the organization as well as sharpening of competition between the employees.  The sample size was not adequate to draw reliable conclusions about the whole organization but was sufficient to analyse tendencies.  On this basis it is argued that at least in short&#8209;term perspective, replacement of academic democracy with the management model typical of a business organization has rather a negative effect on organizational learning.

Abstract:
The aim of this paper is to demonstrate design principles for a teaching and learning environment that will strengthen the ability of students to become competent digital innovators. The impact of digital transformation on business and society is palpable, forcing organisations to become more responsive, agile, creative and innovative. Moreover, competitiveness is determined by the ability to apply new knowledge to facilitate innovation through the use of digital technologies. A two&#8209;year research study was conducted at a university in South Africa to develop a framework for digital innovation skills. The data were analysed in a four&#8209;phase design&#8209;based research study that applied mixed&#8209;methods research. The research has important implications for the design of a learning environment that facilitates knowledge creation in a digital world.

Title:
The Role of Social Capital in Knowledge Sharing in Higher Education Institutes

Abdulqaadir Diriye
Abstract:
A majority of the activities performed in higher education institutions are routines that need to be learned, remembered and refined for improvement.  These include academic and administrative tasks that are central to the proper functioning of the institution.  In addition to this, as any business, higher education institutions need to compete and innovate at a time when their performances are measured in detail by their management, students, governments and other external bodies. Staff members in various roles often become familiar with certain routine tasks. Although an institution may rely on these members and others who master a particular activity whenever needed, there is no guarantee that staff members or even teams will stay with the institution. Therefore, it would be necessary to ensure that institutional knowledge does not become synonymous with individual staff members and, therefore, the knowledge is available only when these individuals are present and absent when they are away. This paper looks into how higher education institutions can enhance their knowledge sharing practices by cultivating social capital among its employees. It employs a set of semi&#8209;structured interviews to gauge the attitudes of employees of two institutions in Saudi Arabia. This is complemented by a literature survey looking into how social capital theory is adapted by earlier researchers in the area of knowledge sharing.  The findings indicate that trust, social interactions, participation and rewards have strong influence in knowledge sharing.

Abstract:
Malaysia has achieved significant industrial growth over the years due to the enterprising intervention of multinational companies (MNCs). The organisational climate in terms of its collaborative nature and innovative efforts has led to the enhancement of creativity among MNCs. The extent of knowledge sharing behaviour within MNCs, particularly in the Malaysian context, has not been thoroughly researched. A huge primary survey involving 20 MNCs with 155 respondents from both manufacturing and service sectors was included in this study. The findings of the study reveal that knowledge donating and knowledge collecting highly and positively influence creative performance. Interestingly, knowledge collecting mediates the relationship between an innovative climate and creative performance while a collaborative climate was found to highly and positively influence MNCs’ creative performance through knowledge donating. Thus, knowledge sharing behaviour is pivotal for the success of MNCs in terms of generating new ideas, promoting best practices, continuously improving and reducing the redundancy cost of learning to facilitate organisational effectiveness.

Enterprise Social Networks for Knowledge Sharing: Lessons from a Medium&#8209;Sized Company

Authors:

Abstract:
The use of Enterprise Social Networks (ESNs) as knowledge management tools has been widely investigated in case of big organizations, while there is little knowledge about advantages and possible implementation problems in small and medium&#8209;sized enterprises. To fill this gap, the paper analyses the case of adoption and use of the Yammer platform by a medium&#8209;sized Italian company. Yammer is an ESN service platform owned by Microsoft which includes several Web 2.0 features and whose interface resembles a typical public social network like Facebook. The research applied a quantitative approach: a questionnaire was submitted to all users of the ESN platform in the company between January and February 2017, with a response rate of 41%. The study contributes to the literature on social media as KM tools, by providing insights into the possible barriers that can undermine the success of ESN platforms as KM tools in the context of medium&#8209;sized enterprises. Specifically, it highlights that two factors (intrinsically connected to the size of the company) are particularly crucial: the limited number of users, and a sort of naïve (“me&#8209;too”) implementation strategy. An important lesson is that the success of ESNs in medium&#8209;sized enterprise is influenced by personal (individual) and organizational factors, even more than technical ones. Especially, the need to reach a minimum critical mass of users can be a challenge. A limitation of the study is that it investigated only one company operating in a sector with specific knowledge needs and capabilities.

Title:
How does Intellectual Capital Disclosure Affect the cost of Capital? Conclusions from two Decades of Research
Pages:
pp29&#8209;55
Authors:
Łukasz Bryl

Abstract:
According to Dumay (2012), there are two grand foundations of intellectual capital (IC) disclosure theory: the MV/BV ratio and greater profitability because of the lower cost of capital. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to perform a literature review of the empirical studies conducted in the last 22 years on the link between intellectual capital disclosure and the cost of capital (cost of equity and cost of debt). The findings of empirical research analysed in this paper indicate that the hybridization of financial and non&#8209;financial data reporting contributes to the lower cost of capital. Moreover, in general, researched studies confirm a negative relation between the non&#8209;financial information disclosure and the cost of equity. IC data disclosure also improves credit rating and thus lowers the cost of debt. In terms of IC sub&#8209;categories, disclosure of human capital items performs the strongest impact on decreasing the cost of equity. The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)/ (Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) reports (43%) and annual reports (39%) were the most often utilized IC data sources, followed by corporate websites disclosures (15%). A minority of the studies (4%) used integrated reports, IPO prospectuses, and reports dedicated solely to the IC. This paper has a twofold contribution: first, it provides a valuable insight for regulators, practitioners and stock market analysts into the role of IC disclosure in the reduction of the cost of capital. Second, it attempts to revive the discussion on the relevance of IC reporting by the entities in terms of minimalizing their cost of capital.

Using Social Media to Extract Indirect Experiential Knowledge for the Internationalization of an Entrepreneurial Firm

Abstract:
Social media platforms have become popular and widely used, and they contain large amounts of knowledge hidden in the user&#8209;generated content. This study, hence, suggests that analyzing the semantic meanings hidden within the user&#8209;generated content on social media platforms enables the extraction of knowledge about international markets which has not been previously available, but that can enhance firms’ understanding of foreign markets. The study suggests that novel methods of content analytics, including sentiment analysis, can provide entrepreneurial firms with a cost&#8209;effective way to acquire knowledge about foreign markets in general and about customers, competitors and other stakeholders operating in the international supply chain. To demonstrate this, we present a case study of a craft brewery and use sentiment analysis to extract knowledge of craft beer related discussions in general and of two brands currently operating in the pre&#8209;specified target markets of a craft brewery. Based on an analysis of 20,153 tweets extracted in a two&#8209;weeks data collection period from Twitter, the results of the study show that, in general, craft beer related discussions are positively rather than negatively oriented, and hence there may exist potential for the products of the case company. In addition, the results of the study provide insights into two competing brands currently operating in foreign markets. When comparing the tweets of the two competing brands currently operating in the target markets, the results of the study showed that the tweets related to brand B were more positively oriented and associated more frequently with positive sentiments, in comparison to brand A.

Value Creation Through Collective Intelligence: Managing Intellectual Capital

Andrea Garlatti
Abstract:
The contribution of intellectual capital to value creation beyond individual companies into wider society, as described in the fourth stage of intellectual capital research, is of particular relevance for the public sector where organizations have a stewardship responsibility. They should engage stakeholders into value co&#8209;creation by developing organizational and ecosystem collective intelligence through traditional as well as innovative tools such as online technologies. Yet, the relationship between intellectual capital and value creation often remains a relatively unexplored process within public administration. This paper focuses on the case study of a regional agency in Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy, which is not only responsible for assistance, regulation and service delivery, but also for engaging its stakeholders and the public at large to disseminate knowledge to promote values and appropriate behaviour in the policy areas it is responsible for. The research looks at the role played by intellectual capital in the agency’s value creation strategies and how the agency’s structure and processes influence the development and management of intellectual capital in an effort to create value for its ecosystem. The research not only validates the existence of ecosystem frameworks in public administration and the key role played by intellectual capital in their design, creation and implementation, but it also highlights the need in the public sector for a defined role for intellectual capital, stakeholder engagement and collective intelligence in governance models. In particular, findings underline the need for new intellectual capital management systems based on a collective intelligence approach within multi&#8209;stakeholder co&#8209;creation frameworks in a public service ecosystem logic, reflecting the public sector’s evolving role and the new tools developed with the advent of new technologies.

An Examination of Inter&#8209;Organisational Learning and R&amp;DCapability through Open Innovation
Pages:
pp80&#8209;88
Authors:
Takuya Miyamoto
Abstract:
This study illustrates how Toyota, one of the world’s largest automobile companies, emerged as a leading research and development (R&D) company in the rechargeable battery business in Japan. This study examines the 1990s–2000s period, during which Toyota accumulated substantial R&D capability in rechargeable battery technology. Several automobile companies, such as Toyota and Nissan, have engaged in research on rechargeable battery systems that are adaptable to electronic vehicles. Compared to Nissan, Toyota collaborated with several external partners. A time&#8209;series analysis of patent data comprising 631 samples spanning from 1998 to 2003 shows that Toyota accumulated its R&D capability over time, absorbing technical expertise from partners and ultimately evolving into a leading company. Patent citation data (N = 353) between 2006 and 2009 can trace these patents back to the technologies of Toyota’s former partner, Panasonic. These results confirm that Toyota gained technological expertise from its partners and eventually initiated internal R&D. Earlier studies on open innovation focused on how partnership influences technological output alone. This study sheds light on the specific inter&#8209;organisational aspects of learning via open innovation. Although open innovation is considered a direct outcome of technological output, open innovation for inter&#8209;organisational learning broadens the theory regarding indirect outcomes for R&D capabilities and direct outcomes. From theoretical and practical perspectives, a company must exploit open innovation for the long term with respect to partnerships because it takes time for such partnerships’ influence on R&D activity to take effect. By cross&#8209;correlating lagged patent data for Toyota and Nissan, this study documents the following. First, inter&#8209;organisational learning effects are delayed, significant and persistent. Second, open innovation through partnerships for basic research and supply chain research generates learning effects. Finally, R&D capabilities gleaned from a core partnership and a long&#8209;term partnership can lead to internal R&D enhancements.

Award&#8209;Winning Organizations: How Outstanding Organizations Manage the Registration, Access and use of the Knowledge of Employees
Pages:
pp91&#8209;104
Authors:
Ragna Kemp Haraldsdóttir
Abstract:
Organizations have managed information regarding knowledge of employees using various processes such as knowledge mapping, network analysis, codification and personalization. Some of these organizations have been chosen to receive awards for their outstanding performance, for instance for their finest use of knowledge. This paper examines how knowledge award&#8209;winning organizations distinguished themselves from other organizations, when it came to the registration, access and use of the knowledge of employees. The aim was to provide an understanding of how these organizations supported personal knowledge registration, and whether winning an award entailed a more comprehensive overview of the knowledge residing in employees. Whether the organizations benefitted financially from the registration process was also examined. This was a qualitative research. It was a multiple&#8209;case study, covering 18 organizations in Iceland, of which six had received the Knowledge Company of the Year award. A total of 35 semi&#8209;structured interviews were conducted and six award&#8209;winning verdicts analysed. A conceptual model was used to clarify the results. The findings indicate that the award&#8209;winning organizations received the award for outstanding success. Still, little emphasis was put on the management of the personal knowledge of employees. Interviewees experienced adversity regarding costs, time, limited access and use of personal knowledge. Most interviewees claimed that the registration of knowledge had a financial gain but found it difficult to measure and hard to confirm.

Abstract:
There is an increased focus on relevance of higher education. Mostly it is about enhanced job opportunities or job advancements for the individual. However, relevance of higher education may also be towards solving important issues or problems at a workplace. There are some necessary preconditions as to how an educational activity becomes relevant. Firstly, the student must be capable to discover how generic knowledge and acquired skills may or may not apply to concrete situations at work. This requires experience, understanding of the norms and culture of the organisation and a certain form of practical intelligence. Secondly, the conditions at work place must be conducive to innovation and change in various ways. In this article, we present a case study where employee turnover and lack of effective training routines were a major efficiency constraint in a Norwegian firm. With constant competition, changes in markets and other factors that influence the sustainability of an organization, cutting costs, such as high turnover and the time from being newcomer to being fully operative in the job. The responsible for training activities in the firm realized that additional formal education at the higher education level was needed, and he decided to enrol in a Knowledge Management study program at The Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences in order to learn how he could improve knowledge management and learning processes of new employees at his workplace. The case study ultimately demonstrates how crucial the interplay between content and form of education on one hand and specific conditions facilitating changes and improvements at work on the other is for the relevance in formal higher education narrative.

Abstract:
Knowledge is becoming a paramount resource of innovation economies. The efficient management of generation, use, accumulation and transfer of knowledge within a non&#8209;linear innovation process plays a critical role in economic growth. Knowledge geography registers the uneven landscape of the national innovation system and captures the key excellence clusters at different hierarchical levels – from local nodes to cities and regions. While the spatial patterns of knowledge commercialization are primarily considered via production processes at the regional level (regional innovation systems, regional innovation clusters), knowledge generation has to be monitored and assessed at the level of cities. Urban settlements accommodate communities of people and a population of firms that form unique configurations of innovation ecosystems that sculpture the intellectual capital of regions and states. This paper presents the distribution of knowledge&#8209;generating centres in Russia by undertaking an in&#8209;depth evaluation of bibliometric data for 440 settlements across the country for a period of 2013&#8209;2017. Methods of spatial scientometrics enable to register the intellectual capital accumulated in a certain locality and analyse development trajectories of urban settlements. Russia is an interesting case of studying the spatial patterns of knowledge generation. The large territorial extent of the country, the remoteness of individual cities from each other, their heterogeneity in size, level of development, and knowledge specialization makes it a highly diverse context. Research results suggest that knowledge domain characteristics are formed irrespective of the population figures, whereas the development dynamics of small and medium&#8209;sized cities are specific. Smaller cities strive to be integrated into inter&#8209;regional and international collaboration in order to overcome the shortage of local resources. A limited gross volume of research output generated by small and medium&#8209;sized cities creates extreme indicator values as compared to the major cities and the national average. The study concludes with a typology of cities taking into account the specific features of knowledge generation dynamics.

The Status quo of Knowledge Management and Sustainability Knowledge

Authors:
Beate Klingenberg
Helen N. Rothberg
Abstract:
The United Nations (UN) 2030 agenda for sustainable development issues an urgent call to transition to sustainable business models and life styles. Outlining seventeen concrete sustainable development goals (SDGs), organizations and individuals are encouraged to actively participate (United Nations, 2015). However, as of the 2019 report on the SDGs, progress is slow.  Organizations that aspire to be economically viable as well as socially and environmentally responsible global citizens, need to understand what sustainability means and how to institutionalize its principles. This paper posits that some of the underlying reasons for slow progress are lack of full understanding of the required knowledge and its systemic nature, as well as potentially insufficient knowledge management processes. It  proposes that sustainability knowledge learning should include three “DCA” steps: 1) What to know: identify which knowledge is needed (DEFINE); 2) How to learn : develop strategies to identify sources and learning strategies for the requisite sustainability knowledge  (COLLECT);  3) How to use sustainability knowledge: develop knowledge management practices that enable absorption  and institutionalization (ACT). Comparing the DCA model to other sustainability knowledge management models reveals that internal processes are emphasized (ACT). Fewer models consider the second step, COLLECT. The necessity to identify knowledge needs, DEFINE is almost entirely absent. Given the complex nature of sustainability knowledge, it appears that currently, knowledge management practices may be inadequately designed to support organizations in their transformational change towards sustainability and in the development of required stakeholder partnerships. Said systemic nature is also ill reflected in knowledge management research for sustainability. Further limiting is a lack of a clear definition of sustainability knowledge. This paper is a call for research to establish a clear view of what sustainability knowledge is, and based on that, a more detailed development of effective knowledge management strategies.

Knowledge Acquisition and Meaning&#8209;making in the Participatory Budgeting of Local Governments

Abstract:
The participatory budgeting of Brazilian municipalities is one of the most publicized examples of democracy&#8209;in&#8209;action that fosters citizenship knowledge acquisition in local government. This research adds two new perspectives to the participatory process. The first one demonstrates how knowledge is acquired and shared, and which are the new contextual conditions for this acquisition to happen, which we call, the knowledge acquisition process. At second, we explain the meaning&#8209;making process as a subjective way to acquire knowledge about oneself, the others, and the democratic systems. Citizens, public servants, policy&#8209;makers, and politicians acquire new meanings for the role they play in local government and become reengaged on democracy through the ontological change from representative to participatory and deliberative democracy. In this qualitative research, our methodological bricolage relies on the triangulation of methods (i.e. documentation review and observations of behaviors and procedures; in&#8209;depth&#8209;interviews; and, focus groups) and sources (i.e. comparison of cases, and stakeholders). The bricolage deconstructs these social actions on their constituents, vis&#8209;a&#8209;vis hidden intentions; instruments; and, implementation. Among the several Brazilian cases, this longitudinal study (i.e. 12 years) concentrates on five of them. Our findings suggest that the participation in the process allows for a change on individuals’ understanding of democracy, enhances citizenship knowledge acquisition, reframes the meaning of citizenship, and improves the quality of relationships among the stakeholders involved. In the participatory budgeting, citizens learn, what critical theory calls “to emancipate”. They act as if they were members of an ideal kingdom of ends in which they were both subjects and sovereigns at the same time, which guarantees citizenship engagement, learning and development.

Abstract:
Meetings are the activity at the centre of every organisation; they are critical. But there is a problem: most people hate them. How can we solve this so&#8209;called “paradox of meetings”? How can we avoid death by meeting? By reviewing meeting theories which help to better understand meetings, we have found support for the view that bad meetings today are primarily the consequence of unsuitable knowledge sharing and collaboration. Based on this and by applying our new understanding of collaboration as New Collaboration, we propose to look at meetings by focusing on collaborative problem&#8209;solving and to perceive collaboration in such problem&#8209;solving meetings as New Collaboration. But how do we have to interact in order to implement New Collaboration in meetings? This is where our Pyramid of New Collaboration comes in as a detailed description of the collaboration process. Our paper will first review related literature dealing with leadership, meeting theories, knowledge sharing and collaboration. Then, we will explain in detail our concept of collaboration, the process of collaboration and the Pyramid of New Collaboration with its seven layers. Finally, we will discuss the application of the Pyramid to the solution of the paradox of meetings and propose the concept of a New Collaboration Meeting.

Abstract:
Thе paper investigates the influence of a set of twelve various nature knowledge sharing barriers (shortly, KSBs) on the knowledge sharing speed and quality in the administrative subdivisions of six leading Russian universities. The respondents have been answering the questionnaire including questions regarding the KSBs’ perceived strength from the knowledge requester and knowledge holder positions, thus creating four models tested via the IBM SPSS Statistics 22 package as linear regression equations. The testing results are showing statistically significant influence of several KSBs on the knowledge sharing speed and quality. The methodology and results of the study have both practical applicability and theoretical value, as administrative subdivisions are considerably unpopular objects of knowledge sharing research in higher educational institutions, in contrast to the research and teaching subdivisions. Several further research development directions are suggested, considering both the sample extension and changes in the research methodology.

Abstract:
It is increasingly considered important to understand how companies plan their Knowledge Management (KM) strategy. The literature provides evidence that there may be different possible approaches to KM strategy. A significant distinction has been made between “codification” and “personalization”. Sometimes, these two approaches have been seen to be alternative to one another. In other cases scholars argued that a company can follow a strategy that mixes the two approaches depending on diverse intertwined factors. Still, on this topic, the literature provides various and sometimes contrasting results that need clarification and confirmation. Especially, there is the need to understand if changes in internal and external conditions may induce modifications in a firm’s KM strategy.The goal of the study is to analyse how the mix of codification and personalisation can vary over time in the same company, due to changing organizational and environmental conditions. With this purpose, the evolution of KM initiatives of a multinational company was investigated. The findings of the study confirm that the strategic mix can change over the years due to modifications in the factors of the company’s internal and external context. Furthermore, the case shows that the different factors have different weight and play a different role in influencing such changes. Specifically, in the investigated case, the factors related to the competitive context affected the evolution of the KM strategy more significantly than internal factors (which were just enablers or constraints of the evolutionary path). In addition, the study shows that this classic distinction between codification and personalization may not be easy to use in practical terms, due to the complexity of KM activities and needs in a company: this point can represent a fresh start of a future research agenda.

Abstract:
Knowledge translation can be understood as the ability to translate concepts between different contexts by stakeholders who have different skills, aims, and even feelings in their relation to such concepts. Knowledge translation tools allow for the effective transfer of existing knowledge as well as the emergence of new knowledge of value to some or all of the stakeholders involved in the process. Knowledge translation is particularly challenging in healthcare and medicine, where different practitioners (e.g. physicians, biologists, engineers, researchers) and professionals need methodologies and tools to communicate and share knowledge among them and with patients in an effective manner. To better understand this phenomenon, we conducted a Structured Literature Review (SLR). The concepts knowledge, translation and either healthcare or medicine were used as search terms in the title, abstract or keywords on Scopus, which highlighted more than 2,000 contributions in the medical literature and only 22 in Business and Management. Our review of these documents revealed a need in the healthcare sector for better managerial and organisational practices to cope with the various challenges related to the sharing of knowledge among stakeholders. At the same time, the business and management communities appear to have made significant progress in addressing the same issues. We therefore decided to concentrate our analysis on the works published by the business and management community as a mean to highlight future research directions for the healthcare management sector. Thus, our research identifies areas of relevance which are currently underdeveloped, provides insights on both theoretical and empirical developments and offers a critique of the approaches, research frameworks and methods used, as well as emerging trends in these domains. Despite a lack of an agreed definition of the term Knowledge Translation, our findings highlight a growing interest in the topic, with most of the contributions published after 2015. Scholars have approached the term from a variety of perspectives depending on the nature of the stakeholders of relevance to their studies. Whilst there does not seem to be a predominant framework, the literature reveals several tools and techniques that are effective in enhancing Knowledge Translation in different contexts. New research opportunities in this domain emerge in terms of underinvestigated areas within the healthcare sector.

Abstract:
Knowledge translation (KT) is the ability to make knowledge accessible to different stakeholders by translating it into various contexts. Translating knowledge is particularly crucial in the healthcare sector, which is currently under significant pressure due to technological innovation, increasing demand of services by an ageing population, budget reductions, and new organisational challenges posed by the latest events like the COVID&#8209;19 pandemic. While the first definition of KT was focused on the translation of scientific research into clinical practice, other types of KT later emerged. In healthcare, while stakeholders have different skills and competencies (such as clinical scientists versus physicians or other healthcare professionals), others experience diverse emotional feelings (like the patients or their families). An effective KT allows the transfer, sharing, and creation of new knowledge, enhancing innovation and co&#8209;production dynamics. The paper employs a case study by analysing the Breast Unit of the C.R.O. National Cancer Institue of Aviano, Italy, one of the most acknowledged hospitals and research centres in Europe in the field of cancer surgery and treatments. The paper aims at studying the knowledge translation dynamics and tools by analysing the various relationships with the internal as well as the external stakeholders of the Breast Unit. Internally, knowledge translation is needed to merge the competencies of highly skilled multidisciplinary teams, which include surgeons and physicians with various specialities, researchers, psychologists, nurses and other healthcare professionals. Externally, knowledge is translated to meet the needs of patients, patients' associations, sponsors, citizens, and policymakers. Results highlight how different techniques and dynamics allow KT to happen within internal as well as external groups. Contributing to the knowledge management and knowledge translation theories, our findings open up to practical as well as research implications.

Title:
Detrivialization as a Strategy to Challenge Organizational Groupthink

Abstract:
This paper aims to contribute to the literature on knowledge construction and knowledge sharing within the field of organizational communication. The research underlines the importance of exploring human learning contextually, descriptively, interpretively, and inductively. Through a participant&#8209;observer methodological approach, the study contributes to the literature by introducing detrivialization as a strategy to explore ’participants’ rhetoric related to their organizational procedures. The paper describes a case study that took place for 18 months in a cancer research lab in Belgium, where employees seemed unable to question several taken&#8209;for&#8209;granted practices. The present research primarily reveals the consequences of trivialization, when the rationale of essential organizational practices go unnoticed until observer&#8209;participant challenges the status quo. Also, the study highlights the outcomes of the detrivialization approach, which triggers unprecedented knowledge. Finally, the paper introduces the (de)trivialization dynamic model, which can depict the consequences of opening black&#8209;boxes in organizational contexts. This research is a new approach in organizational ethnomethodology, revisiting ’Garfinkel’s (1967) breaching experiment to describe science in action. The suggested model offers a methodological approach for exploring trivialized organizational dynamics and challenging groupthink. Detrivialization is an opposite approach to trivialization, to offer a new debate topic to scholars aiming to conduct ethnographic research and discourse analysis in organizational communication.

Abstract:
Organizations, including the healthcare sector, are subject to changes in market, technology and regulations. This requires enhanced and different types of knowledge, and has led to an increased demand for adult higher education. However, the competencies required need to be met by the providers of higher education. This article presents a qualitative case study investigating the work relevance of an adult education study bachelor programme for middle managers of the public health sector in Norway. The paper explores how the education has shaped the interplay between the student/practitioner and his/her surroundings. The data in the study have been collected using in&#8209;depth interviews. The case study showcases the potential impacts of higher education within public healthcare management in the workplace, also highlighting the factors that are predominant regarding the application and dissemination of formal knowledge in the workplace. The primary findings of this study are that there is an interplay between the form and content of the education, personal capabilities and individual characteristics of the student (employee/health manager), as well as an organizational maturity pertaining to knowledge&#8209;management and the exposure to organizational innovation in the broader healthcare system. The case study contributes to the field of knowledge management issues by showing how a study programme can support the development of knowledge management practices in an organization, through focusing on the relevance pronounced through the management practices.

Abstract:
The Pharma sector is a much&#8209;regulated market, and this means that this industry must test their products tocomply with existing standards to assure the required level of quality and safety before being authorized to lunch thoseproducts to the market. Supply chains, data integrity, and tightening regulations are just examples of business processissues that affect quality strategies on a day&#8209;to&#8209;day basis. Besides, regulatory bodies are increasingly focused not only oncompliance but also on building a culture of quality management. In this domain, the Quality Management System (QMS)is a well&#8209;known system to support processes, procedures, and responsibilities for achieving quality policies and objectives.The QMS also drives consistent metrics, risk calculations, and other trend analysis in developing periodical Product QualityReviews (PQRs), usually corresponding to one year periods, related to the product and with its active substance. The PQRsdevelopment process requires proper management of knowledge so that it can be replicated in different activities. Thispaper proposes the adoption of Gamification techniques in each phase of PQRs. In pandemic times, it is importante toimprove the performance of each activity, gathering the engagement of the employees. Gamification is usually related toemployee motivation, which, in turn, is conducive to the achievement of better results in the organization. In this context,it is necessary to understand how the commitment of stakeholders evolves and if the application of Gamificationtechniques allows enhancing this variable, taking the evolution of the performance as another variable that could beevaluated. This paper focuses on innovation in the area of knowledge management, based on the projection of a Gamifiedmodel related to managing activities of a PQR development project at the level of the active substance. The paperpresents a case study where the proposed model was applied to analyze the performance achieves in a nationalpharmaceutical industry in Portugal.

Abstract:
The perception of knowledge management has evolved over the last several decades from managing the information to the involvement of employees in knowledge work – in particular, in the OL processes. However, research literature describes various obstacles for organizational learning in hospitals, related to both, the context of the organization’s activities, as well as the clash between the professional autonomy of the clinicians and the bureaucratic requirements regulating the work done by the clinicians. This paper looks into the peculiarities of the OL of clinicians occurring on both individual and collective levels and examines the causes that condition these peculiarities. The paper opens with an introduction, wherein the research problem is substantiated, the aim of the research and the conceptual positions are provided, the logical structure of the research is outlined. The literature review conducted in the second chapter reveals the essence of organizational learning, explains the significance of individual and collective learning for OL. Next, the researchers delve into the work done by clinicians as professionals in the context of OL. The steps taken allow substantiating the three levels of clinicians’ involvement in the OL processes – individual, group/department and organization&#8209;as&#8209;a&#8209;whole. A thorough review of the theoretical background created the conditions for the empirical investigation into the organizational learning of clinicians. The research has been conducted in a small hospital in Lithuania. Highly selective sampling suggests that the data on the OL of the clinicians acquired during the research, and a detailed description of its relation to the context provides reliable insights into various aspects of the organizational learning of clinicians. The conclusions also raise questions that require further investigation, suggest health care administrators and clinicians consider collective efforts to create better quality organizational knowledge that would enable healthcare institutions to cope with continuously emerging ill&#8209;structured problems.
