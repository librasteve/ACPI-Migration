        <title locale="en_US">Evaluating Factors Affecting User Satisfaction
        in University Enterprise Content Management (ECM) Systems</title>

        <abstract locale="en_US">Higher learning institutions (HLIs) are
        implementing enterprise content management (ECM) systems as web
        portals that are helping them interact with and serve their students
        better. However, there is a paucity of research that has evaluated the
        factors that account for students using their university’s portals. As
        a case study and using the D&amp;M IS Success Model as a guiding lens,
        this paper explored the factors that influence Limkokwing University
        of Creative Technology (LUCT) Students to use the university’s portal
        through a survey. Data was collected from 134 students through
        Stratified Random Sampling technique that was analysed through Partial
        Least Square ‑ Structural Equation Modelling (PLS‑SEM). Results
        obtained show clearly that LUCT students are using the university’s
        portal as a result of the System Quality and Information Quality which
        gives them Satisfaction. However, the findings reveal no significant
        correlation between Service Quality and Satisfaction of the students
        as well as the System Quality and Behavioural Intention (BI) to use
        the Systems. This study has given more insights into LUCT Management,
        Administrators, and Faculties concerning how to handle their Students
        need. Other implications for both practice and theory were also
        discussed.</abstract>
